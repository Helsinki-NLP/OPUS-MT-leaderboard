MPs from the Welsh National Assembly fear they will “look like fools”
Some members of the national assembly were frightened by the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in line with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from various political parties are afraid that this may cause them to be ridiculed.
One Labour MEP said his party was concerned that it “briefly rhymes with the words twp and pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means flabby and "pwp" means poop.
A Welsh MP said the party as a whole was “unsatisfying” and proposing alternatives.
MP of the Conservative Party said that his party is approaching the change of the name "liberal", but noted that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u".
The Commission of the Assembly is currently working on a draft law that will change the names, which states: "Of course, the responsible members themselves will be responsible for the final decision on the appropriate designation of the members of the Assembly."
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission made public the results of the public debate on the proposals, and the results showed that there is broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the designation of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the title ‘Members of the Welsh Parliament’ (WMP), but the MWP was given the most support in the public debate.
It is obvious that the members of the assembly are trying to propose alternatives. However, an agreement may be a problem, especially for President Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill on changes in a few weeks.
The reform laws will be followed by other changes in the way the assembly is organised, such as the rules governing the expulsion of members and the draft system of committees.
When the law is spoken, the men who are in the church will have the last word.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The people voted in favor of this resolution, trying to settle a decades-long dispute with the neighboring Greek, which has its own province called Makedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor expresses a claim to Greek territory, and therefore a repeated tent against the country’s aspirations for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, a supporter of the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum returned Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that changing the name is simply the price the country has to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of the Church of St. Martin have died down as a result of the problems of the churches in Harlem
“The old men with whom I spoke said, ‘ In the past there was a pool on every corner, and there was a pool, ’ ” says Adams.
"There are none of them today."
In his opinion, the loss of the bars is understandable.
"People today socialize differently," he says.
"The bar is no longer a place where people from the country gather together regularly."
Now concerning the colts, he is afraid that the money from the sale of the goods will not last as long as the officials think, but sooner or later it will be back to the beginning.
And when he had prevailed, the houses of the hired servants might have cast out the poles; and the fourth part of the tabernacle was filled with men, who would not support the temples that were around them.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will turn white, ” he says.“ So the day is near when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who come to these quarters will belong to these churches. ”
The two churches built the white congregations before Harlem became the capital of the black population. The church of the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the church of St. Martin a decade later.
The leading white congregation of the Methodists withdrew in the thirtieth year of the last year.
The claim for the building was made by a black congregation not far from the temple.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was a rallying point for a boycott of retailers on 125th Street (the most important shopping street in Harlem), who refused to hire and support blacks.
The fire severely damaged the building in 1939, but Father Johnson’s parishioners had this bell-tower built as part of their plans to rebuild the church.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bell tower “the bells of the poor.”
The specialist who played the bell-tower in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument.”
This specialist is Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the first bell-ringer in the world, played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind. He began to play the larger bell-ringer in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's Church.
Now in the course of the last few months a complex scheme of architects and suppliers took place at St. Martin's Church. Some of them were brought by the leaders of the church in the world, and others by the diocese of the episcopate.
The local administration of the parish, which is made up of the leaders of the world, and which is also the local administration of the parish, wrote to the diocese in July that it was afraid that the diocese would “let the expenses be paid” for the administration of the parish, even though the administration of the parish was not willing to hire the architects and suppliers.
Now some of the priests were complaining about the lack of transparency in the way they were handling the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobster in California has been injured by a shark.
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while hunting a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on a Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help. So he went with the group to the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy was delighted that he had caught the lobster, but then “he found the boy shouting, ‘ Something has bitten me!
Something's got a bite!'
His collar bone was completely broken, "said Hammel, noticing what had happened the first time he came to the boy.
“I told everyone to come out of the water. I told them, ‘ There’s a shark in the water! ’ ” said Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
At a briefing, the captain of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, noticed that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of the body.
Investigation and security authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours, from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's wants to create cosmetology alleys in a line of department stores to compete with the likes of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with specialist assistants available.
This is a significant investment of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which is constantly growing, but is declining in fashion and household goods. As part of the investment, larger cosmetic streets will be tested in 11 markets.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that once belonged to televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw being available for the first time.
The current boards of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will receive more Priest, because they will be available in places reserved for brands similar to, for example, Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is re-marketing its make-up shop, Boutique, so that most of the products are available to vegans as well, and this is even more so for younger customers.
Perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will also be testing the concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and the trend of buying small quantities of food every day in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the general manager of Sainsbury's, found that the stores were becoming more and more like department stores. His chain of supermarkets was trying to cope with the discount sales of Aldi and Lidl, so as to offer more services and more than just food.
The community of Sainsbury’s incorporated Argos into its hundreds of stores and incorporated several Habitats for sale. The two chains bought the community two years ago. By this measure the sales of food increased, so that the acquisitions were better.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to innovate the department with cosmetics and medicines ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested the partnership with the Boots chain after 2000, but the merger ended a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the drug store in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business three years ago with 281 Celesio stores. The company is owned by chain LloydsPharmacy and had a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
The company said that Lloyds chain would play an important role, as it would add a wider range of premium skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Sales Manager, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of the cosmetology aisles so that our customers can shop in a more pleasant environment.
In addition, we have invested in the special training of our colleagues, who will be able to help you with your messages and will be ready to help you.
Our brand advice is designed to meet all requirements. The impressive surroundings and practical locations mean that we have become an important destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' by Holly Willoughby's pledge of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones' Dragons Day star was "infuriated" by TV presenter Holly Willoughby's pledge of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new covenants with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of interior accessories and Truly accessories.
The work of these two men was compared to the work of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning has announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby has enraged Dragons' Den star Peter Jones by cutting herself out of a lucrative co-branded lifestyle store at the last minute to focus on her new mega-contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was furious when the golden girl on TV, during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the new covenants – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – meant that she would no longer have time to go into the interior of their brand.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated net worth of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain and headed to one of his holiday resorts.
One source said: “Truly was clearly Holly’s number one priority.
And he was destined to have a long future, and he was destined to secure it a few decades in advance.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to everyone involved.
But no one understood what was happening on Tuesday. So close was the market.
There's a warehouse at the headquarters in Marlowe full of goods ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, as a result of huge investments in products ranging from vanquishments and candles to clothing and home furnishings.
Besides all this, this means the end of our long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Cappovej for ten years.
Willoughby designed Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became the director in March.
The two couples spend vacations together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones told him last night, "We're not going to talk business."
“It was a difficult conversation, and then we became very pleased with each other. ”
He made fun of criticism from the media for his remark, which some will consider her “unworthy of a president” and blame him for speaking so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with his mocking “moderatorical” voice.
"I didn't promise anything."
He noted that after the initial joint meeting in Singapore in June, Kim is interested in the second meeting. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a big step on the way to the removal of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
However, the promise of the elimination of nuclear weapons has stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Jong-ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea saw no “deliberate response” from the United States to North Korea’s first steps toward disarmament.
He noted that the US instead continues to apply sanctions with the aim of increasing pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech before the assembly.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were in danger of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great connection.”
He said his efforts to improve ties with Kim had yielded positive results — the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of more American troops home.
He also defended himself in an unusual way by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to talk like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people outside trying to get in, and there would be 200 people standing there instead,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed one of the islands and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, a foreign non-governmental organization learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to leave their homes, a nationwide catastrophe was not declared, which is an indispensable prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
"In many cases, the complaints were clear that they were not asking for international help, so it's a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
For although the one who is traveling to Palu is part of the Save the Children, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will have the opportunity to work in the field.
Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the spokesman for the disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to take part in relief work.
Because of the earthquake that Indonesia is facing all the time, the country’s readiness for the wrath of nature is being tested.
For in Aceh they are built for a shelter from the tsunami, but they are not common in the rest of the coasts.
It is probable that a great number of the sacrifices of the lives were accomplished, that a siren was being missed in Palus, which guarded against the tsuns, since it was an active warning.
Even under favorable conditions, traveling between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters are taking logistics even further.
Now the sick boat that was at Lombok is heading for Palu to give careful consideration to the earthquake offerings. But it will take at least three days to get to the place of the new plague.
President Joko Widodo built his election campaign to improve Indonesia's sprawling infrastructure, spending heavily on roads and railways.
But the seer, who has a lack of finances, is suffering from a shortage of funds, and next year he will be elected again.
Moreover, Vidodo was under pressure from the continuing religious tensions in Indonesia, for the majority of Moslems had become believers in a more conservative way.
During the fighting between the Christian and Moslem gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands more were forced to leave their homes. The gangs used machetes, bows, arrows, and other weapons of violence.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from FC Liverpool from a distance equalized against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate, losing 1–0 to him at the time.
And throwing the ball to his left hand, he sent forth a dart to the farther part of the pit.
His attempt hovered high above the penalty area and headed toward the upper right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball went into the net through the one who was catching Keppa Arrizabalag.
“I was just trying to get into that position to get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kant coming toward me, and I made one touch, and I did not think much about it, but shot at him. ”
Chelsea led with a 1-0 lead in the 25th minute, followed by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward returned the goal to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, turning in the middle of the field and sprinting to half of Liverpool.
The blacksmith gave a quick hint in the middle.
Then he sent a beautiful handwritten note from Prienik, which led him and Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and ended up at a more distant pole, beating Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The match starts on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will fight against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia stood at 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency on Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake. The earthquake struck on Fridays and caused waves as high as 6 meters, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, was filled with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who was stabbed to death
A murder investigation began this morning after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The people in the field are telling them what they have seen and heard. They want to come and talk about it.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I urge all who are near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious.
In the same way, I urge everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who have used the on-board camera to get in touch with us, because they may have key information for our investigation. ”
The one who was speaking from the field confirmed that the woman whose body was found to be a resident of Birkenhead was found to be in a state of restlessness.
“At noon today they went to the place where their friends had been working. They thought they knew the woman. They wanted to find out where she had been found the next morning.
And when the examination was completed, and the field, it became known that he was now informing the family members of the sacrifice.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but she told him in her field that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say a word.
“Now the owners of the apartments know that they will be back in a few hours.
And they heard one of the officers saying to another man that the whole region was now considered to be the scene of the crime.
And there was a woman weeping in the place.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible, too."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was standing outside.
There were several policemen in the cordon watching the panel house.
The police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with reference to Protocol 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in front of Parliament is the latest memorial to the controversy over the "prescribing of historia"
His removal would have been gratifying because his fanatical Puritan supporters, like the Taliban, destroyed so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts.
However, the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite the history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “At the time of the discussion about the removal of the statues, it was self-evident that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before Westminster Palace would become one of the ends.
Cromwell neither ordered nor executed the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent realizations by Sir William Ham Thornycroft bear witness to his perception in the 19th century and are part of a written record of a personality that, according to many, still deserves respect."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many – perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today – to be the protector of Parliament from outside forces, in his case, of course, the protector of the monarchy.
Historians continue to debate whether this is a fully accurate description of reality.
It is true, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique personality who is the embodiment of one side of this dispute.
The things which the Lord has done are worthy of glory and honor, just as those things are worthy of him who is over them.
A Chinese farmer is being beaten to death by a crippled man.
According to local media reports, a farmer in the southeast of China attacked and killed a farmer with a limp.
The man, identified only as Yuan, was found dead with a dissected artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in Liu-pchan-shui prefecture, Kuizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a small-pox farmer prepares a vaccine in a small-pox factory in Xining prefecture, Qinghai province, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 crippled ones on the market.
The next morning the man’s cousin found him dead. He found that the door to the pigsty was open.
And he said, “A large male, with a blood-stained scepter, was in the manger. ”
According to the administration of the court investigation confirmed that this 250-kilogram boar rejuvenated the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised," said a cousin nicknamed Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security cameras, Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pups.
And his body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to John or to his cousin.
The manager of the market told Evening News that the woman who had been strangled had been separated so that she would not attack anyone else. Instead, she gathered evidence from the fields.
Yuan's family and market representatives are reportedly seeking compensation for his death.
For though the attacks of those who are cleft off against a man be evil, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, she attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to her husband.
Ten years later, a Welsh farmer with a weight of 295 kilograms pressed the tractor until his wife managed to scare the beast away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his raccoons in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the raccoons aren’t usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playful.
Shantia, they are inquisitive. They do not intend to harm anyone.
"We just need to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring to the southwest of the United States in many places heavy rain
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h on Sunday at 5:00 am East American time, which is the category 1 hurricane. It was located 620 km southwest of the Mexican runaway Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
And a trough began to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the USA. And as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday, like a tropical storm, she began to press a deep tropical humidity north to the southwest of the USA.
On Monday, the sun rises in some parts of Mexico. It rises more than two feet [about 25 cm] high.
Tropical moisture will then form in combination with the approaching trough in the coming days, with scattered and heavy rain in the southwest.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimetres of precipitation will fall, causing severe dangerous flooding, flooding of the shoals and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rains, during which the point will fall 5 to 8 millimeters of precipitation per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona, a precipitation of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected.
It can cause severe flooding, for the variations are rapidly getting worse, due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It would be foolish to go out into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
A strong rain will cause the rivers to overflow in the canyons. A strong wind and dust in the air will blow from the winds locally.
As the floodwaters nearer some parts of the coast of southern California, they will cause heavy local rains.
There may be more than 13 millimetres of precipitation, which could cause debris to rise and the roads to become narrower.
It would be the first rain in the area during its rainy season.
In the evening on Sunday and in the early morning on Monday, there will be showers of tropical rain coming in from all over Arizona. In the evening on Monday and Tuesday, the rain will be heavy.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will fall on the four corners of the earth, and they will last until the middle of the day.
In October, there may be significant temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. because the Arctic is cooling, but the tropical zone remains moderately warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature at a short distance.
A great example of rapid changes in temperature is in the USA on Sunday.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees.
In the next few days, he will again try to transplant and spread the heat of the summer, which will last forever.
In the middle and east of the United States, the warm beginning of the october is expected in many places. In several areas from the Southern Plains to part of the northeast, the temperature exceeds 26 degrees.
It could be 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the prime.
Our long-term climate prediction indicates a high probability of excessive heat in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by more than 20 million people.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television networks the powerful testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault. The attack on Christine Blasey-Ford allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political stalemate persisted. On Friday, the radio and television stations suspended the broadcasts for a last-minute reversal: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured an agreement under which the FBI can investigate the charges of the week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had caught her in a drunken state and tried to undress her at a high school party.
But Kavanaugh, the one who spoke passionately, said that he was 100 per cent certain that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast, as reported by the Nielsen community on Friday.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
For the other networks that sent the transmission, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
Nielsen has a very common problem with measuring ratings in offices.
For comparison – a similar number of viewers watch the playoffs of American football or the submission of the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, which had been heavily promoted by pundits to replace Kavanaugh, was watched by Nielsen during a full-day audition by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, the most of any network.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
And even after the trial had ended, his interest was high.
Flake was the main character in the Friday drama.
After the offices of this moderate Republican had announced that he would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, CNN and CBS caught him on Friday morning, shouting at him as he was trying to get a hearing from the Judicial Committee.
He stood there for a few moments, his eyes wide open, listening to the complaints that CNN had sent out live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one of the women.
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
Someone told him, “You have great authority, but many women are powerless. ”
Flake said that his offices had issued a decree. But before the hearing was over, he added that he would speak more after the hearing of the committee.
Now all the cable companies and the rest of the nets were going through the matter alive, and a few hours later, when the committee of the court was about to vote on whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should go to the whole senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated next week the charges against the nominee, which are being pressed by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a friend of his.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
And the will of Flake was great, because it was evident that the republicans would not have sufficient votes to obtain the approval of Kavanaugh without a hearing.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of a “borderline of political hierarchies” in connection with Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused those critical of her intention to leave Europe of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party's founding in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, appearing on the front page of a newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her Brexit plan, which is likened to a lady’s game, saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose each other’s customs was “completely absur”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Fields in connection with the death of LSU player arrested suspect Dytheon Simpson
Police arrested a suspect who allegedly shot and killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the fight between Simpson and the Simpsons, saying that Sims lost his eyeballs during the battle.
Seeing the field of the eyeballs at the scene of the crime, she realized that Simpson’s DNA had been found on them, according to WAFB, a CBS partner.
After questioning Simpson, she informed the police that he had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the lawyer’s information, his bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office issued a preliminary order Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement agencies for their “efforts and the enforcement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played basketball for LSU and his father Wayne.
Last season, he had a 5.6-point primer and a 2.6-point rebound per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said he was "broken" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano spewing poplar at Mexico City
And the ash, which cometh out of the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern fourth of the principal city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid the volcano, after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has repeatedly recorded noise and tremors.
Photographs on social media showed thin layers of ash covering glass walls in parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after an earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017 with a force of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Protesters clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after some of the pro-independence protesters clashed with the police. Thousands more took part in the parallel demonstrations, commemorating the first anniversary of the Catalan vote to tear apart.
A group of masked separatists was stopped by fields of order, tossing eggs and powder to make way for the streets filled with dark clouds of dust that sometimes swarmed with tourists.
Later in the day there were also clashes. The police used batons to bring the fighters under control.
During several hours, a group of independence supporters chanting "we will not forget, we will not forgive" faced Unionist Protestants shouting "Long live Spain".
According to the local authorities, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
There is still a great deal of tension in the region seeking independence, even a year after Madrid declared it illegal to hold a referendum on 1 October. But Catalan separatists praised it.
A large majority of those who voted chose to be independent, but the share was low, because the dissenters boycotted the vote in large part.
In fact, according to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year when they tried to stop the people from continuing to vote in polling stations throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent demonstratia in support of the national police.
The demons continued, but they had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of the best eyeballs.
“My parents were so happy that they could vote, but now we’re in jail, ” he says.
Although Catalan political parties, demanding independence in regional elections last December, won a narrow (but important) victory, this year they are no longer able to continue successfully. Many of their most prominent leaders have themselves gone into exile or are awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming a protest in support of the telephone field, says politicians on both sides have contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is getting worse and worse, ” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is showing us," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for hit by car in house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 UK daylight saving time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building itself had been damaged.
Besides, it could have been a crossbow car shooting.
Meng's goal meant Livingston's victory over the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Rookie Livingston shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games since taking up the role of coach of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's action proved to be decisive, bringing Gary Holt to the other Hibernian.
Gerrard is still out in the Premier League this season without a win. On Sunday, he will be led by Hearts, behind which he is eight points behind.
And before that, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Wien into the Europa League on Thursday.
For six games, Livingston overtook his undefeatable streak in the league. Holt, the head coach who defeated Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the bitterness of defeat.
Livingston Burned Chances Against Screaming Guests
Holtov should have been in the lead long before the goal. His superiority made the Rangers no small problem.
Scott Robinson passed through, but his trial passed before the gate. The end of Alan Lithgow was only in the air when he reached Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The locals calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests from standard situations.
In the same way, the deciding goal was scored.
There was a direct volitional kick being played against the Rangers, and Livingston was able to get through. Declan Gallagher and Robinson found Menga after the combination, and he scored from the middle of the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the ball, but they could not beat the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was most of the time unemployed.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to perform the procedure.
Scott Pittman's attempt stopped Ranger Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow ended Livingston's next standard situation.
They were constantly pointing the centers into the sixteenth Livingston, and the defense was constantly turning them away. The players demanded a penalty twice – after Halkett’s intervention on Glenn Middleton’s uncle and on the alleged hand – but the umpire let the player continue in the game.
"Phenomenalny" Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
All the players were as good as one man, and they continued to live up to the expectations as they went on their way.
The peak of the game and the players in the team have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves great credit for how he has so far improved since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett could not believe it. He had a perfectly organized defense. But Menga wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall finish the whole game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspirations.
They played well under Gerrard many times, but they did not reach this level from a distance.
They lacked a final guard (only to be defended by the house). And this is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the midst of the tablet.
But Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a warm welcome at Cologne,
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany took part in a rally in Berlin, and the mood was excellent.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the aim of which is to repair ties between NATO allies.
The dispute arose over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to the city of Cologne to open a huge new mosque there.
The largest number of Turks live in the city outside of Turkey.
The police found that security reasons had made it impossible for a group of 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but there were many people there who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of them Kurds) testified against Erdogan’s policies and the decision of the German government to invite him into the country.
The opposition shows that there is a difference of opinion between the two men. Some of them call him a hero, while others call him an autocrat. Some of them are German and call him a hero.
Accident on the road in Deptford: the death of a cyclist after a discount with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. British daylight saving time near the intersections of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street. It is a busy road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics came to the scene, but the cyclist was injured and rushed to the scene.
The accident happened only a few months after another cyclist was killed by a conductor who had escaped from the scene of the accident. The accident happened on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the police tried to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses are diverted, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison. Six guards were wounded in the riots
Six prison guards were wounded during the riots in the high-security men’s prison, which was led by the prison authorities.
The riots broke out Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. in Britain's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire and continue.
The members of Tornado’s special forces were called to the place. The riots were to be brought under control. Eight prisoners were held accountable for what they had done, and they were able to divide them into one group.
The guards in the place took care of the smaller wounds on the face.
A spokesman for the prison said: “We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison in the UK.
Six of the employees were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in prisons, but we want to make it clear that we are handing over those responsible to the police and that they can spend more time behind bars.”
More than 500 prisoners are serving their sentences in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In the morning a report was published that the jailer had been hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
Last year in October, a riot squad was called up to the prison to put an end to serious riots. The prisoners attacked the guards with billiard clubs.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (areas affected by drought can benefit)
The tropical low pressure in Arizona is a remarkable phenomenon. However, it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa directs through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, returning the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will go directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and on Monday evening it will be preceded by rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “ten tropical cyclones within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix have had tropical storm or pressure status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, and in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona it can be up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In the rest of the desert southwest, it is likely to fall between 25 and 50 millimeters in the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Pan, which can be as high as 100 millimeters.
But in places where there is no flood, the rain from the dew will be helpful, because the area is suffering from drought.
Although the floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest is experiencing a dry season at the moment.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing a minimum of extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa hits the mainland first through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The dew, which still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is located 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia Mexican run, heading north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and it was losing intensity.
Therefore it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, when it reaches the mainland Mexico, it will have the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be high, which means a high risk of flooding.
"Between Baja California and Sonora's northwest, a total of 75 to 150 millimeters is expected, in some places it can be as high as 250 millimeters," the weather.com website said.
Then the dew will go on like a tropical storm through Mexico to the north, until it reaches the border of Arizona as a tropical depression on a Tuesday morning. Then it will go up through Arizona, and on Tuesday evening it will reach southern Utah.
“The greatest danger posed by Rosa or her remains is a very large number of collisions in the Baja California area, in the northwest of Sonora and in the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These are the things that are expected to bring life. These are the dangerous torrents of floods, the gathering of dust in the desert, and the landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three boys, aged 17 to 18, and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m. UK daylight saving time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a “stabilized” condition.
A boy of 17 years old, two boys of 18 years old, and a man of 20 years old were kept in the district of Radstock during the night. This caused the fields to flow into the region of Avon and Somerset.
Everyone who has seen the incident on their mobile phones is asking to come and answer the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the ignominy and anger' of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and repulsive tactics,” Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the ignominy and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Speaking before Congress on Thursday, Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally denied the accusation made by Christine Blasey-Ford that he sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager some ten years ago.
Ford said the same thing in connection with the interrogation charge.
The president said Saturday that “the American people had the opportunity on that day to see Kavanaugh’s uniqueness, character, and courage.”
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most respected experts in contemporary law and a lawyer with a perfect history of public service," said the crowd of his students in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in elections in the middle of the functional period.
“There are five weeks left until the election, which is the most important thing in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
"That's why I'm doing my best to support exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats’ goal was to “resist and obstruct.”
The Senate's first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, according to a senior Republican official who told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people, and the number of victims was as follows:
At least 384 people were killed, and many were killed by the waves that came to the beaches. The waves were so strong that a strong earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The authorities reported this on Saturday.
In the evening, hundreds of people were gathered together on a Friday at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu. They ran aground on a wave that was up to six meters high. The waves were destroying everything that was in their way, and many people came to live.
The tsunami followed the earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
"Yesterday there was a tsunami threat, and people were still spending their time on the beach, not running away and becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone; it took away cars, rafters, houses, and sowed everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was at 800 km/h on the high seas before it hit the shore.
When he learned this, some of the people climbed up on the tree to survive. They were trying to escape from the storm.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges hidden and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday in this coastal city continued subsequent otras.
And there were a few earthquakes in that region, which has a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong Friday quake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped during the Second World War in Hiroshima.
The agency reported that the tsunami might have increased the intensity of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
After describing the damage done to Nugro as “significant, ” he caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels to collapse.
He reported that the bodies of some of the sacrifices had been laid under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 had been wounded and 29 had been unfaithful.
Nugroho said that the loss of life and damage could be greater in the region of Donggala, which is 300 km along the coast north of Palu, for the region is nearer the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications “were completely paralysed” and from Donggala “no information is available,” Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there, ” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that some of its workers and volunteers were being sent to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report the Palu tsunami, but the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the warning had been given.
In the amateur tape, people were using the social media to record a man who was on the top floor of a building. He was shouting out in the streets to people in the middle of the street that a tsunami was coming.
A few minutes later a wall of water came up on the beach. It was taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications with the city of Palu and the surrounding area, complicating the coordination of rescue efforts.
The authorities reported that the army had begun to send expensive aircraft from Jakarta and elsewhere, but the evacuees were still in urgent need of food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport was reopened to the public with the help of the shuttle and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision workers from Donggala got safely to the city of Palu, where the workers were hiding in the shelters that were built in the courtyard of the office. They were going through the areas that had been destroyed, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
When relief workers began to take on a difficult task and to work on rebuilding after the disaster, some of them complained that it was not permitted for foreign aid workers with extensive experience to come to Palu.
Finances, supplies, and laborers from other lands may come in accordance with Indonesian regulations only if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster.
That's why it didn't happen.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“If the government says it is a national disaster, we are able to open the door to international assistance, ” he said.“ But this has not happened. ”
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami that followed on Friday, the families and friends of the unfaithful were hoping that their loved ones would be able to work a miracle in the gloomy scene of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday the paramedics freed the woman who had been trapped in the ruins for two days with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two unfaithful paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those detained at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, one of whom was Mandagi.
"If I have been long in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Subandono described how, a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had circled the paragliding community, he was desperate to send the WhatsApp administrations to mourners in Palu who had taken part in the beach festival.
But while he was walking about, there was seen a certain grey character, beginning at the beginning, instead of the two blue.
"I think that means the records haven't been delivered," he said.
The thieves stole 26,750 dollars while filling up an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee area, part of the Newport Police Department's pressure department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in this entertainment complex and was about to put in more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy.
But because he was so busy, another man came running from the back of Brink’s coworker’s house and stole some bags of money to put in.
According to the administration, witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene of the crime, but the number of perpetrators involved in the incident was not disclosed in the report.
If you have any information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Kanye West is officially known as ‘Kanye West.’ ”
West, 41, has a nickname for Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is due to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation from “reasons of sentiment”. The creator of the show seduced her.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has in the past declared that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said this year, referring to the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
But from the word of Kanya, which means “One, ” it has come into being, Yea, which reflects what is good, what is evil, what is perplexed, all things in us.
The album reflects more of what we are.”
And he is another of the great rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
The former co-worker of West’s, Jay-Z, presents himself in the same way, with both a hyphen and a hyphen, in both upper and lowercase letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never, under any circumstances, use the military to overwhelm the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at peaceful demon-possessed people in this square, killing up to 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans with a monthly student donation and the opening of other free public universities.
And he said, “The lack of employment and the lack of opportunities to train make young people join the ranks of the criminal gangs.
U.S. to Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this sphere, as noted by investor and promoter of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These decrees come after various U.S. government entities have expressed themselves in the field of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a general formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
On the contrary, China presented its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in the field of innovations of artificial intelligence.
“Since all the rest of the country is much further behind the U.S.A., and we’re trying to make another breakthrough in the field of AI, a double budget on AI would be a good start,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances of another big success in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general manager of Sinovation Ventures, a China-based venture capital firm.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-rated American player under the name Othello, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and the general manager of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state-sponsored technological clashes, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when another one would take place to help expose future visionaries.
As Lee said, execs in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants.
“The academic leaders are not taken away from us by China, but by big corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best minds from universities to work for them on AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in AI.
"I think a green card should automatically be offered to holders of a PhD in AI," he said.
The Chinese National Committee released its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in ways similar to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which intends to attract partners from the intellectual and academic community. The White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence
At the same time, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
On the contrary, in the US legislature, which was trying to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSACI), there has been no activity for a whole month.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia." This move would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor as a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments worked out a deal in June to replace the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said there would be no vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign had cast doubt on whether participation would reach the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you a member of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Supporters of the name change returned to Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that it is a price worth letting Macedonia, the country that emerged after the demise of Yugoslavia, into communities such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for a future for the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they may live free and under the protection of the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although voting is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have declared that they will respect the will of the electorate and decide on the outcome.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no irregularities in the referendum by 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, and our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country, thanks to which it could join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small podium in front of the parliament in Skopje and dragged the capitals to the tents set up by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We may be a poor country, but we have our own dignity.
If they do not want to receive us as Macedonia does, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration. ”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that a final “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
Last Monday, the Prieskum, which was made public by the Institute for Political Appeals in Macedonia, found that 30 to 43 percent of voters are preparing for a referendum – which is below the threshold of necessary participation.
Another trial, conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The rejection of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to the fore last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats all the defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke the brighton defense and scored a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero's elegant goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first glance.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the beginning of the stock in the middle of the field.
And having passed through the midst of the three defenders of Brighton, he ran out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
And he was girded round about one that defended himself, and compassed about a few others at the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a pass to the left, where the ball found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguer, who smashed Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguera has the same foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly how it was.
We were lucky to score a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who won Cityzens the opening advantage in the Premier League.
His goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton by playing this game.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling in a direction to a distant place.
The attacker, Cityzens, struck the ball into the net just before it snuck into the car.
City are set to face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances for the Rockies
When the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were not many reasons for them to press on to the next start.
But Scherzer, who is very much in pain, hopes to take a stand against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, even if there are still consequences for the Rockies, who have one match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
With a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies kept their wildcard chances, but they still had to confirm their first division title.
Even if we are not playing at all, at least we are still able to go up to Iriska with the thought that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with such a crowd and opponents, we will see the highest level that we will reach this year.
Of course I want to experience it."
The Nationals haven’t yet announced the first pitcher for the week. But apparently they won’t allow him to pitch in a situation like this.
And the Scherzer, for whom it was [the] 34th race, having thrown a bullpen on the Thursday, was tossing and tossing on the Sunday when the day of His respite was running.
The Washington right-winger has a balance of 18-7 with a score of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The president did not directly point to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the Midterms.
“In November, everything we have been given will be put to the strike.
We have five weeks to live, until the time when we will have the most important election of our lives.
It’s a huge, huge opportunity. Even if I’m not running for office, I’m actually running for office. That’s why I’m going up and down the country fighting for our great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right before our eyes.
They are determined to gain power over anything in this life, but they are evil and malicious.
They don’t care who they hurt, whom they must beat, in order to gain power and control. They want it exactly, and power and control, but we won’t give it to them. ”
And the democrats, he said, went forth to resist and to hinder [them], on a mission.
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, evil, and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was met with a loud exclamation from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
You let the document escape?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, no, I, wait. Her body language was evil. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer liberal.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinion.
When the activists of the Momentum organization voted for my correction, I was hardly surprised.
Finally, the last thing I want to say is this: I am from a group of Labour MPs who were told that they would no longer welcome him. All this is to express my opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
For example, when I was criticized, he criticized me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, about similar issues on which Jeremy did not coincide with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham said: “We want to make it inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC's Friday evening sessions were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many people today don’t agree with this tone of voice, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever paid for itself.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated on the Labour side, and every opinion is judged by whether it is favourable to the party’s leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy came to the fore, because colleagues whom I had previously thought to be of a similar political opinion, at once expected me to turn 180 degrees and to accept views with which I would never otherwise agree, whether of national security or unity.
Every time I speak in public, and there is one thing I will say in substance, I am followed by a tirade of criticism on social media, crying out for an appeal and giving up politics in the middle, and I hear it as if I were not supposed to be on the Labour side.
And this is not my only temptation.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face and never hide from the daily throes of sexist or racist attacks.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is the normalisation of the level of attacks.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer such famous liberals, and with every speech of “mistrust” or change of election rules, the party is becoming more and more narrow.
For the past two years the crowd has been advising me not to speak too much from the crowd, but to be quiet and to keep pace, and then I will be ‘ in order. ’
But that is not what I went into politics for.
When I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, I was encouraged by the gentleness of Thatcher’s government, which allowed my high school to collapse. So I tried to promote better public service to those who needed it most, whether they were in the city council or in the city council.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in my last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
But to those who supported me on Friday, I would like to say this: If the country is creeping toward Brexit and harming households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy trying to resolve my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not to be taken from me. It does not begin with the Momentum in Nottingham. It is for those who live in my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not. I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that I will not make any demands on you. I will not make any demands on you or make any demands on you.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr gets to the top
Two quick attempts may have shaken the end result to some extent, but it is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly poignant match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
And now he was on the top of the table, the only one who was not defeated by the ten.
Finally, the victory was won over by a good defense at home, as well as by taking advantage of opportunities. And Peter Murchie, the coach, has every right to be happy.
“During the matches, we were tested in many ways, and we are not defeated, so I must be happy,” he says.
And Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Drop your hat before Ayr, for they have taken a better chance than we have.”
Thanks to Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to change Frazier Climo, Ayr came into the lead, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to be counted, and Jason Baggot wrote down the unaltered attempt.
Climo took Ayr's lead with a penalty, and then, at half-time, scored with a solo attempt, which allowed Ayr to take a break with a score of 17-5.
However, Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, changed to Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
This was followed by a prolonged delay due to the severe wounding of Ruaridha Knott, who was weaned. As soon as the game began, Ayr was guided by the trial of Stafford McDowall, who changed Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of this in the form of Bruce Colvin's unaltered attempt at the end of a high-pressure encounter.
But the home side came alive again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting Clima without the ball, MacPherson reached touch-down from the penalty shootout with the approaching Ayr horde behind his back.
Climo changed, like almost at the beginning of the action, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kickboxing and sent Gregor Henry's wing away during the fifth home run.
Still Game star embarks on a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is about to start his career in the field of services. According to our information, he was appointed as a director of the company with a license to conduct restoration.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC programme, writing and starring alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life outside the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang (the reality of the series).
According to official records, Adriftmorn Limited is the manager of the company.
The actor refused to tell the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to take part in the "recovery restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to restore access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are guarding the headquarters of the navy in La Paz. They are dressed in sails.
Blue flags are flown in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are washed away by the motto: “The sea is our right.
We have a duty to get him back. ”
In all of Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive – just like the desire to re-ferment the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Now the hope is perhaps greatest for the last ten years. After five years of negotiations, Bolivia awaits the judgment of the international court on October 1.
“Bolivia is on the rise, it has a spirit of unity and balance, and of course it believes in a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal at The Hague will decide in Bolivia's behalf that after decades of intermittent dispensation Chile will be required to negotiate sovereign access to the Bolivian sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who will take part in the controversial fight for re-election next year, is expected to make the same decision on Monday.
"Our return to the Pacific Ocean is at hand," he declared at the end of August.
But there are some analysts who think that it is impossible for the court to judge the case in the interests of Bolivia, and if it had been, not much would have changed.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grow the Chilean territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any yearnings.
The fact that the ruling of the international court comes only six months after hearing the closing arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there can be no doubt about Bolivia's arguments, it is possible that it has taken a step back in recent years.
"The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government," Zarate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric undermined Chile's all-encompassing response.
In one day Bolivia and Chile will continue to have discussions, but after that it will be very hard to hold a dialogue.
The two countries have had no ambassadorial representation since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, said the court's decision would be unusually swift.
Monday brings Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance “to end 139 years of misery and gain mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – would use the naval question as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“Decision is an opportunity to realize that we must put an end to the past.”
North Korea rejects nuclear disarmament until it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country won't get rid of nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri performed at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic discussions on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is an illusion to think that the constant US sanctions and protests against the declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps toward disarmament.
Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
There is widespread scepticism, however, that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing its arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows the latest trends in impressive headgear, which you will soon find in your store
If you want to expand your collection of hats or to protect yourself from the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed in their Spring/Summer 19 collection a range of unusual oversized headgear that stunned viewers at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this year and these designers have sent their shocking creations to showcase the molo.
Valentino's unique piece was a voluminous beige hat decorated with a papier-m<0xC3><0xA2>ché roof covering the heads of the models.
And among the superfluity of these was melon, which was engraven with precious stones, and the witch's head, and even pineapples: but these are not meant to warm you.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre meatballs – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the parchments had feathers sewn together, and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One piece of art looked like a diver’s suit of clothing with a snorkel and eyeballs, while the other looked like a turtledove with ice cream melted.
And if you like bold fashion expressions, you’re in luck.
The experts in the field say that these men will also go into the stores in your area. They say that these men will buy very big hats.
The oversized hats follow the inspiration of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a 60-centimeter-wide roof worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that lurked around every corner of social media sent another great creation to the moths – a straw beach bag almost as big as a swimsuit-wearing model.
A raffia bag of burnt orange paint, framed by raffia straps and complemented by a white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 19 collection from Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the mainstream stores next year — the designer having such a huge influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Without language skills, the global citizen will not be left behind
Scottish independent schools are maintaining excellent academic performance, and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of extraordinary trial results, further strengthening individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare the students for further and higher education, for a career in their field, and for a place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement curricula to measure, we still perceive modern languages as a popular and desirable elective in schools.
And Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you are speaking to his heart. ”
This is a strong reminder that if we want to build our confidence and confidence with people from other lands, we cannot rely on the English language alone.
From this year’s results of the trials, we see that languages are at the top of the list with the highest number of names among independent schools.
In total, up to 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a basic skill that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Today, languages are regarded as equally important as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in independent and non-independent schools.
The Commission’s 2014 inquiry into the UK’s employment and skills found that 17 percent of the reasons cited by the employers as problems in filling jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Because of this, the ability to speak in languages becomes more and more necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities arise that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have an advantage for the future with this life-long learning.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign lands automatically brings a person who speaks a foreign language an advantage over the competition.
According to YouGov, among the more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language fluently enough, and French was the only language in which the population reached double-digit percentages worthy of the title.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in teaching languages.
The knowledge of many languages, especially those of a country with a developed economy, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Every school in the province of Scotland will be judged by the languages it teaches.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Let your child take care of whatever he needs to do. He will always be able to choose from a large number of languages in an independent school, and he will be taught by experts in the field.
The schools in Scotland, which are independent, have undertaken to provide a training for their children. They will equip them with everything they need to succeed in the future.
At the present time there is no way to deny that in the global marketplace languages are still vitally important for the future of the earth, which must be mirrored by education.
Modern languages should really be called “international communicative abilities.”
The independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity and the diversity and the excellence of the quality to the young people in Skottland.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is the manager of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to make his San Diego debut on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first game for the Los Angeles Lakers are looking forward to it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But it is uncertain how long it will take him to play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, announced on Twitter that James will be playing a limited number of minutes.
After training for the start of the week, James set his sights on the Lakers' six-game schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any more pre-game kick-offs," he said.
Trump's meetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of pre-election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s planned meetings for next week to return stops at places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Then, as the vote for his Supreme Court nominee has been held, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia today, and where can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online below, via a live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the current hearing of the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who was again charged with sexual misconduct, with the Senate’s expected confirmation vote adjourned for the week.
However, the primary goal of this series of meetings is mainly to help the Republicans, who are waiting for the difficult November elections, to regain their strength.
According to Reuters news agency, therefore, these five meetings are for the coming week, to “encourage volunteers and scholars, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority of what they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that when entering a busy election season, the president will travel to as many states as possible,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s meeting, held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania” and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, whose preferences are lagging behind in terms of austerity.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to raise his preferences in cahoots," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Shows Courage to Fight and Hopes to Succeed in Entering the Sunday Fights of Individuals
After three one-sided series, foursome matches on Saturday can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The oscillating pendulum of momentum is an invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in the struggles of this type.
Now, on which side of the mountain is the power to move people now?
They were leading by six points, but now they are only four, so we could say that we have some power to help them. ” Jordan Spieth said as he prepared for the day of trouble.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, a four-point lead, and the other twelve in the game.
As Spieth saith, The men of America have a gentle wind in their sails, and have many reasons for their hope, besides the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which they have played with one another all day long, and have obtained three points out of four.
Spieth was unconquerable from the threshing-floor to the very last: and he leadeth the rest by his example.
And as he went on his way, the shouts of thanksgiving grew louder and louder, and he was drowned by the keystroke, and the fourth match was undecided, when he and Thomas were two and a half behind each other.
He glorified his putt, which had won their match at 15, with a similar cry, which proves his conviction that the American is not lost in the race.
"You must roll up your sleeves and start thinking about your own struggles," said Spieth.
None of the players have any other choice.
18 holes where you need to reach the maximum.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undecipherable favorites of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming European couple, having four out of four, has no way to go wrong.
Now Moliwood was the only two who did not shoot the bogeys on the Sabbath day, but they went out on the Sabbath day and on the Sabbath day at noon, and on the other nine holes on the Sabbath day.
This round, and the way the energy flows between the tumultuous crowd and the players, confirms that these players will have to be defeated on Sunday, and it is difficult to find a more popular player who would consolidate a potential European victory at sunset over the Igris Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Fleetwood.
Best of both at the same time on different holes.
But the question of the glory of Europe is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the early fourball, playing in a pair with Alex Noren.
And one bogey and two doubles, on the first nine holes, they dug a pit for the Spaniards and the Swedes, from which they were no longer able to dig.
No one is here to help you escape from the pit on Sunday.
Fourball and foursome matches are fascinating because of the close-up interactions between the two, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and the way strategy can be viewed from minute to minute.
Europe has played better so far, and it has an important lead to the final day, but these foursome wheels have also shown that the US is not afraid to fight, which some, especially on the American continent, doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after finishing Saturday's matches of fourball and foursome with the lead against the United States 10:6.
Encouraged duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over the tormented Tiger Woods, to add four points to their Le Golf National account.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to hold on to the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the American side in the early fourball matches and won the series 3-1.
In foursome matches, the Americans offered more resistance, they won two matches, but they could not starve their deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 individual matches to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match, they solidified their performance and defeated the distraught Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who staggered through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 matches in foursome and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the early four-ball matches, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the unit and the three in the world doubles.
But Europe did not have it easy on that pleasant, fresh day to the southwest of Paris.
Three-time clear winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point latency for the Americans on Saturday.
They earned a scrambled 2&1 win over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a four-some match after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has he managed to break the four-point deficit by entering individual matches, although Fury's side, as the defending champion, needs only a draw to hold the trophy.
After that, as they were in the other place for two whole days, their strength seems to be greater than their ability to withstand the onslaught.
North Korea 'will not disarm unilaterally without confidence'
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened mistrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told an annual general meeting of the World Institute that North Korea has taken “substantial countermeasures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and ensuring that nuclear weapons do not spread.
"But we do not see a responsible response from the United States," he added.
“Without any confidence in the United States, it will not come to our national security, and under such circumstances it will be eliminated, so that we will be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally. ”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known indignities at Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his position was crucial in that he did not immediately sweep unilateral nuclear disarmament away, as Pyongyang had done in Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea tried to achieve a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In the same way, Washington has refused to release the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States first of all insists on nuclear disarmament and increases the measure of nuclear disarmament by means of sanctions, in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, and finally by imposing a ‘declaration of end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion to people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions that remain are going to make us even worse off."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the U.S. president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister stressed three encounters between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were on the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue instead of the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not go to such a blind spot.”
In contrast, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the emboldening of U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “rocket man on a suicide mission.”
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, sang praises to Kim at the UN for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said he still had a lot of work and sanctions to do before North Korea was stripped of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable, but that "it doesn't matter if it takes two, three years or five months."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s enforcement of sanctions must continue strictly and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and subsequently signaled that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, but an hour later North Korea condemned him for making "gangster demands."
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon this month, pledged to dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate precautions."
Kim told him that the “appropriate safeguards” he expected were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing ties with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to breathe enough
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to ensure that all students get more sleep in an effort to curb the growing trend of studying all night long with the help of caffeine.
The researchers found that the students at the world’s foremost university are often clueless about the full basis of their health care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Clinic, has developed a course that is the first of its kind in the United States.
And when the course was established, he was instructed according to the dispensation, which he knew about the dispossession of the sleep, and which he found in the doctrine.
At the end of the class a girl came to me and said, ‘ Why do I have to find out about this now, in the last year? ’
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course, for the first time, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the university had decided to open the course when it found that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the work week.
The hour-long course covers a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a dormitory room on the screen, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects sports performance and what a regular regime is important.
In addition, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know it won't change student governance immediately.
But we are convinced that they have the right to know about this – just as everyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to have been able to study all night, he says, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students means sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against weight gain, because sleep deficits put the brain into starvation mode, so they constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to pass the course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step it will be possible to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before they embark on a demanding study program.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock both for the time they need to go to bed and for the time they need to wake up. They are aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of grief at an outside match when Dolly Mengu's shot condemned Steven Gerrard to a 1–0 loss at Livingstone.
The hosts from Ibrox tried to record their first victory outside of the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but by doing so, Gary Holt brought Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games in the role of manager and left his team in the position of 8 points from the leaders of the Ladbroks table.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time mark, and the Rangers, lacking in intelligence, did not even come close to being even.
While the Rangers were now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, trailing Hibernian by a one-goal margin.
And the Rangers may have other troubles after this, because Calum Spence, a chiropractor, was wounded in the head, because an object apparently struck him, thrown from the audience to the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes, and the Rangers beat Ayr to reach the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt left the same eleven to Livi, who had taken the Hearts point last week, and he was delighted at how his good team had suffocated their opponents in every action.
The Rangers might have been dominant in the possession of the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were only going to score a goal in the second game, when Mengu sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate to take his first call from Irrigation, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's long straight kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only get past the back pole from a distance.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have more hope than conviction.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to a penalty after four hours of play when he clashed with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson overturned the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers scored just two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goaltender, Liam Kelly, was barely knocked out by Lassan Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejari's tame shot.
Although the opening goal for Livi in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can say that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Again the Rangers could not make peace with Jacobs horn.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher moved the ball through a gap to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard took a break, traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate effect when the wingman found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly hurried out of his spell and blocked him.
Livingston continued to urge the guests to play the kind of games they loved, such as the one they played when Lithgow and Halkett played one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have pushed their lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well, and then resisted Lithgo's wide head from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, later claimed a penalty for entanglement with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Chronicle: The Inventor of the Geiger Computer
And now here's a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the existence and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the organization of the apparatus known as the Geiger computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to still being an inseparable part of science, became a staple of pop culture when it was featured in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by the leading cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger computer, it's got radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on your hearing aids, you are truly hearing the sounds of the atoms being produced by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: Really, I hear them cracking!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the one who has been invented and is called by his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to ‘see’ thin cells
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to ‘see’ thin cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Thin Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
They then “see” a protein that is common in many types of cancer, and it rushes back into them.
The vaccine tested has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize lean cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
With this method, the patient's immune cells are extracted, they are prepared in the laboratory to be able to "see" the protein that is common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and the cells are then pushed back together.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer” of breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and their “teaching” how to carve cancer cells worked in the treatment of the same type of leukemia.
Kanye West wearing a MAGA lace on his head has come under fire for his support of Trump after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't feel right
Kanye West was fired in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he sang to U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song, "Ghost Town," which he wore a lace-up with the words "Make America Great," he launched an attack on Democrats and pledged his support for Trump.
“I talked to a white man many times and he said to me, ‘ How can you accept Trump because he is a racist? ’
“If I had racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live (SNL) began with a scene with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock made it public on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to dissuade West with his eagerness.
In the same way, West complained to the crowd that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of his lace.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go in there with that lace on your head.’
I've been bullied!
And then they told me I was up for a day," the Washington Examiner reported.
West said, “Do you want to see me as I am? I will put on my Superman cloak, for this means no one will tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments had been heard by the audience at least twice, and the others in the SNL were perplexed, Variety reported, with one person telling the media, "The whole study was covered in grave silence."
West was called in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
And West surprised many, when he presented the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, tweeted: “A reference to one of the bravest souls: THE WOMAN THAT YOU HAVE BECAME AGAINST THE DAVA.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was just being himself, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I am determined not to reward anyone (by the purchase of his music or of his clothing or by the support of his ‘ skill ’) who, I am convinced, accepts and promotes an ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are the same," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be "Ye", formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first craftsman to change his name, but he continues in the footsteps of Diddi, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was also named Snoop Lion, and there is, of course, the late evil legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to a craftsman, formerly known as Prince.

The charges will be heard by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Condemns Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in the gritty mid-century fantasy series Game of Thrones from HBO's showroom.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of a boy hero and said that because of such characters on the screen, young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that according to him, “something has gone wrong, and he is considering how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star and 31-year-old Rose Leslie, said he thought it was "very important" to solve the problem.
"Personally, I feel that it is very important to decide where something went wrong in our masculinity," he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, when a problem arises that we now see?”
Kit is convinced that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its cunning and depraved appearance.
And he said, “What is born, and what is taught?
What does television teach, and what happens in the streets, that young boys feel they must have this certain side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the great questions of our time – how can we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone out of the young men.
In the same interview he also admitted that when the series ends next year, he will no longer make any more speeches or sequels about the Game of Thrones, because he is “already finished with the battles and the horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of the series Game of Thrones.
“It was through this show that I met my wife, and she gave me my family and my life to come, ” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, she played Rose Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple gathered in June 2018 at the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, said the representatives of the Chinese health service at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 over the course of the year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
As a result of the conservative values of the country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with a man will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient sexual protection in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied that an employee leaked GOP senators’ data, criticising “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that a member of her staff would send the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to the Wikipedia legislator.
The Los Angeles Democrat says the allegations come from “ultra-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was released online Thursday by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the leak were linked to Waters’ office and provided information about a member of Waters’ staff, Hill said.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, information and security have been compromised by such fraudulent and false charges has never been held accountable for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and utterly false.”
Waters's announcement quickly drew criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Her support is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
If anyone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be rebellious.
We must not question the accuser's motives.
It must be peaceful and balanced.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters’ seat in the current election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it is true, it is great," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had told her about the fraudulent allegations made by the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed, ” she continued,“ and they will be held accountable for their actions, which are reckless and dangerous for all my staff. ”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Undersized Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
Today, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British look, and this is also true for this reincarnation of an action comedy parody with Johnny English – which was first shown in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will it become an ironic self-satisfaction about how obviously we are incapable of a new national export item?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his distinctive facial expressions, has gained the opportunity to spoil everything again – and his name signals better than any other that he is a generous comic creation intended especially for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, that clumsy secret agent who, despite the bizarre claim to a subtle treat, has little of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a spoonful of the guy who came in one tone to the opening tune of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character originates from an international traveler and mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this latest adventure of Johnny English, you can find one or two nice moments.
I was pleased when Johnny English came to the helicopter, dressed in middle-aged clothes, and the propeller was about to hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is evident here, but the humor is a bit under-dimensioned and especially superficial, especially when the “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are already offering comedy as one of their collections.
He works humor as though he were more like a child than a grown-up, and the adventures of Johnny English are not so strange to me, as the inventive and shrewd gags of Atkinson, without words, in the form of the figure of Mr. Bean.
The current background to the film’s story is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy web, exposing the identities of all British agents in the area to the command of his acting agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately lost out on a small role.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and militant figure who is already on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with a figure of the quasi-Terres May type, but she has little to do in the script.
And her counselors informed her that if every one of the spies who were active was betrayed, it would be necessary for him to call someone to his side.
So Johnny English himself comes on the scene. He works as a manager in the same high-end company. He teaches himself how to be a secret spy. Here he finds a few pleasant things. He also teaches English how to spy in the School of Rock.
So when the English are called back to Whitehall for a briefing, they meet their long-time long-time friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, chained to an aspiring submarine commander, for whose part Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a bummer.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disaster in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in full force and encountering a beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenkova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to devise absurd contests. They disguise themselves as cupbearers and set fire to the glittering French restaurant. They cause chaos by girding themselves on the luxury yacht of Volta. And English will unleash pure anarchy, by attempting to ensnare the city.
All the tricks that are being played last are only a little way off. But they must be very effective and exciting. They are a little like a children's program on TV.
The whole impression is more-or-less excessive.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I still have to think, why doesn't the British film premi<0xC3><0xA8>re give Rowan Atkinson a final role that matches his talent?
Labour rejects work on schedule for UK four-quarters workweek paid as a five-day week
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party should be considering a radical plan to allow the British to have a four-quarter week of work, but to get paid in five days.
The party allegedly wants the management of the communities to redistribute the savings gained by the revolution in artificial intelligence (UI) so as to give workers a day of freedom in addition.
It would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend, but would bring home equal pay.
The sources claim that the thought would “correspond” to the party’s economic plans to tilt the landscape to the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-quarter workweek was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “We expect an evaluation of the proposal to be public by the end of the year.
"It will not be from evening to morning, but the four-quarter workweek is an effort that corresponds to the approach of the party to balance the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as with the overall economic strategy of the party."
Labour would not be the first to support the idea, with the Greens earning a four-quarter workweek in their 2017 election campaign.
But the Labour Party, as a whole, does not condemn the effort.
A Labour spokesman said: “Thursday’s work week is not party policy, nor is it considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to advance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
The Lord McDonnell knew that he was determined to get back his power from those who were "anonymous stewards" and "rich men" in the work of the ministry.
At the same time, the plans of the shadow office mean that the current shareholders in the water companies would not get all their shares back, because the Labour government could claim “discounts” on the grounds of a serious misdemeanor.
At the same time, it confirmed plans to recruit staff to the boards of the communities and create Inclusive Equity Funds, so that 10 percent of the wealth of private-sector firms reaches employees, who could receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy debated whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the establishment of the office could authorize some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent out on Sunday, 60 Minutes' program reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something to change their minds about.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went for the trial, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when these things happened, and when the charges were brought against him, I said, ‘ Did you do this? ’
He was determined, determined and unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to be firmly established.
"I have already decided Brett Kavanaugh's case," he said, "and there must be some unprovoked charge against him."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett defied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one who is appointed can confirm this.
That thing's 36 years old.
I don't see how anything can change. "
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to the reduction of poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event featuring an impressive crowd of stars with an even more powerful mission: to end world hunger.
In its seventh year, tens of thousands of people are gathering on the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the arts of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If the audience wants to buy a ticket for a free share (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks or “shares”, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or using some other method.
There are still 12 years to go, so how long does it take for Global Citizen to reach its goal?
Is it a thought to reward people with free concerts in a convenient way, how to persuade them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “collectivism” – when do people feel that they are truly achieving change when I sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “shares” from supporters since 2011, pushing them to different ends.
Organizations say the actions helped incite world leaders to pledge more than $37 billion in pledges and policies that would impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported that 390 pledges and announcements had been made from its shares, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the impact of the media has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the pledges are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to “help children reach their full potential,” promising to provide Rwandan citizens with $35 million to help the country reach its full potential.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, a project that will provide 5 million women and children with nutritional benefits.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “On what basis do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we’ll fall and fall.
But just as there is a great movement of civil laws against apartheid, so we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the personalities who will perform at this year’s event in New York, along with moderators Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as ‘blockade’ to curb Russian energy exports, says Insider
“If necessary,” Washington can call in its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets returned to the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke made it clear that Russia’s involvement in Syria – where they are acting at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I am convinced that the main reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy exactly as they do in eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe, ” he said.
In him there are ways and methods of dealing with these matters.
“I can use the Navy to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not get to the market,” he said.
Zinke was speaking to the participants at an event being held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is emerging as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He also likened Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially equal.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its bag because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These proclamations come at a time when the Trump administration has embarked on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, which is a much easier option for European consumers.
For this purpose, representatives of the Trump administration, returned by US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair economic competition.
"I am convinced that we have the same opinion that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position brought resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German trade union leader, the Bundestag (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with the third state interfering in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Bundestag (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to 'seriously consider' 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for the presidency after the election.
During a meeting at City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that requires a woman at the pinnacle of her ministry,” Hill said.
"After November 6th, I'll seriously consider running for president."
Warren seduced President Donald Trump by sitting in a town hall at the time, saying that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, Prieskum made it clear on Thursday that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center, fifty-five percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator would not be eligible to run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
Prieskum gave more support to former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of his potential candidacy and 48 against.
Other Democratic names mentioned in connection with a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump's Meeting on PTSD Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was drafted into the Army on September 11, 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“As my own son has been going through since he came back, I can relate to the other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told viewers at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Calling his arrest “an elephant in the room,” Palin said of her son and other military veterans, “They’re coming home a little different, tougher, coming back to ask if they have any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the rest of the army have given to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the administration of domestic violence, and possession of a gun in a state under the influence of narcotics, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. to back opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus curiae petition in Washington, D.C., Friday in support of asylum seekers' pleas against the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not made public.
She found that her partner, “and his sons, members of a violent gang,” were abusing her, but the U.S. authorities swept up her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Representatives of the United States, which supports Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged by the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this decision is in violation of the prince’s decision,” Amicus Curiae said.
Representatives argued that policies that discourage immigrants from entering harm the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to seek asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
And the asylum was never to be made ready to solve all the problems – even the most serious ones – that are being faced by people all over the world on a daily basis.
The number of sacrifices at Palus has doubled, and a desperate effort has been made to save those who survived.
For those who were saved, things kept getting worse.
"It's very tense," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she struggles to sway her troubled son in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
“An ambulance is tied up every minute of every day with a body.
Clean water is rare.”
Then the people went back to their homes that had been destroyed. They went through the flood to find what they could find. They also went back and saved everything they could find.
And hundreds of people were wounded, and the hospitals were convulsed with a 7.5-degree earthquake.
Some of the wounded returned Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures of the spine and shoulders, were resting in front of the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside for severe post-traumatic stress disorder.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered the feeling when a devastating earthquake shook his hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I do not know what has happened to her or to my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week later, as the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using U.S. pressure to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid China Daily ad in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s top-selling newspaper — after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, but China has denied the accusation.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s accusation of Beijing trying to meddle in the U.S. election is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war in which both sides adjust tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade conflict were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of farm goods to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his contribution to the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, "China has now doubled its bullying by publicizing its publicity ads in our free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, China is taking advantage of America’s venerated tradition of freedom of expression and free press by publicizing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a newspaper stand on the streets here in Beijing, you will find only constrained dissenting voices, and you will not get a real picture of the diverse views that Chinese citizens may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he said.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has been caught up in his ploy to make his article public,” though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that because of the debacle with Kavanaugh, the Republicans have a chance with female voters
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, analysts warn that they will be avenged in the upcoming appeals, especially by women.
And the <0xCB><0xBB> emotions <0xCB><0xBC> accompanying this matter were exceedingly strong, and the majority of the Republicans had already expressed their desire to cast their vote.
“These things can’t come back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute request for an FBI investigation from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, an adviser to the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the halls of the Senate when Republicans in the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation transcend all boundaries,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news portal.
“People say that the motivation is already high, and this is true.
But it could be even higher, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters aged 18-29, who do not like the president but often do not."
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested there might be a backlash if Republicans confirmed their support for him.
“There’s been a lot of chaos at the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have stood up and acted," Guy Cecil, the head of the U.S.-based group Priorities, which helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
It seems, however, that the Americans are divided as to whom to believe in the dawn of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the favor rather goes to Ford.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony in some way or another, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh in some way or another.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or certain at the time of his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez says a Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while attending a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, called Inrupt, is a community based on Berners-Lee’s open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who is allowed access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to “dominate the world.”
"We must get on with it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
Applications using Solid technology allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, job listings, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in a single browser at the same time.
On a personal online data store, it is unique that only the user decides who will have access to each type of information.
The Society calls it “the strengthening of personal powers by means of giving.”
According to the Director-General, John Bruce, Inrupt’s intention is to bring resources, process, and appropriate skills to Solid, making it available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on projects, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world have been able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his colleagues were not arguing with “Facebook and Google about whether or not they are going to make a complete change that will completely overturn all their business models overnight or not.”
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I see another era of the web with great optimism,” Berners-Lee added.
Priest Bernard Vann: celebrations of the Viktoria Cross bearer for the First World War
They celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of the only priest in England who was given the cross of Victoria as a soldier during the First World War.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by the keeper of the watch four days later, and never learned of the honour of the chief of the British army.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque commemorating the Sabbath.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the board was unveiled exactly 100 years after his old father's heroic battle.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very dense noise and with a strong fire of field weapons and machine guns."
And afterwards he made haste through the line of fire, and led the soldiers before with the utmost gravity, and himself disarmed three of the weapons of the field.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his old father’s actions “are something I never come close to in my life, but it gives me a feeling of deep humility.”
Together with their brother, Dr. James Vann, they placed a crown at the end of the procession led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “felt honored to be able to take part in the procession,” adding that “the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people give him.”
Fans of MMA waited until late at night for the Bellator 206 to be completed and instead received Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night watching the thrilling finale of Bellator 206 and not seeing the end of the main event.
The schedule from San Jose contained 13 matches returned by the six majors and in the UK it was broadcast live throughout the night by Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, the other viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen instead of the broadcast.
Some of them were very upset. They waited until the next morning to see what they could do about the fight.
A fan wrote on Twitter about the children’s story as “some sick joke.”
“It’s a government order that since 6:00 this content was inappropriate, they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the download.
"Yes, it was 'Pig Peppa'."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will work to ensure that viewers in the UK can watch the show in the future.
"When I think about repetition, I think we'll be able to sort it out," Coker said.
“But it is Sunday at six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to decide what time it is. We will not be able to decide until it is Monday, which is the day of judgment. ”
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was over, we exchanged many ways, not being friends.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
For I can assure you that this will never happen again in the future.
Let’s cut it down to five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give the fans something more, and we got it done.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about his sexuality
Olympic water-jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior to others in his sexuality as he matured – but that’s what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that it wasn’t until high school that he realized that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to add "hope" to others.
In the same way, he said that after he became a parent, he became a little less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
In the position of the outcast in the first program with Laverne, Daley said that while he was growing up he felt “like everyone else, because it was not socially permissible for boys and girls to please anyone.”
In his own words, “Up to this day I have felt inferior and inferior, and it has given me strength and motivation to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove to himself that he was “someone, ” so he wouldn’t deceive everyone when they learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading advocate for LGBT rights, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said this because he was fortunate to be able to live a free life. He wanted to give this hope to others also.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “he was surprised.”
Last year Daley worked with a man who was 20 years older than Daley. He worked with him to win an Oscar. But he says that the difference between the ages has never been a problem for them.
“If you are going to live through these things while you are still young,” he said at the time of his first Olympiad, when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, “it is hard to find anyone who is like him, who will have similar successes and misfortunes.”
The couple became parents in June, and their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, was born. Daley said that his "whole worldview" had changed.
“If you were to ask me a year ago, ” he said,“ I would have to ask you about getting a gold medal. ”
You know that there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the idea of death, and one of the last things he asked him was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, Father, you won't be here to sit in the first row," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and when he really stopped breathing and was dead, I finally was able to say that he is not immortal, ” he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that I’d been dreaming about it my whole life – jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
Pr<0xC3><0xAD>beh also inspired his choice of songs – Stream by Heather Smallew – which impressed him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him wintry.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form seated for Saturday's Ryder Cup games
Phil Mickelson is set to set a new record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to be in better shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played a two-year stint for a record 12 times, was seeded by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and foursome matches.
Instead of being in the center of Dianetics, as he had been many times before in the U.S.A., the five-time winner spent the day encouraging and improving his game in the hope of making amends to his reputation.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player did not shoot the best shot, which is not ideal for the tight-knit Ihrisko Le Golf National, where in the long field usually the wrong arrows are revenged.
And as if Ihrisko itself was not a sufficient challenge, Mickelson faces the ninth match in Sunday's exact British Open champion, Francesc Molinari, who, paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, managed to win all matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the start of 12 individual matches, get a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely crucial.
And when he had said this, Furik had confidence in his husband, but it was hard for him to say anything else.
"He understood his own role today. He patted me on the back. He grabbed me around the shoulder. He said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His confidence is high. ”
He is a member of the Siena of glory in the past, and this week also has come to us significantly.
I couldn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined it would be better, but now it has become crystallized, and we feel that we must do this very thing.
He wants to be outside on the grass, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson broke the record set by Nick Fald in the highest number of matches played at the Ryder Cup.
It could be the culmination of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual balance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 runs and 7 draws, although Furyk says that his presence has brought the same incalculable value.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great partner," he explained.
“I think the younger players also had a lot of fun with him, and it was great to see him.
His contribution is not only at stake."
Captain Thomas Bjorn, a European, knows that a strong lead is about to be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his own experience that a considerable lead in entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut in 1997 in Valderrame, where he had a five-point advantage over the Americans under Captain Seve Ballesteros, but despite this, he got through the bowl with the closest possible victory 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I have to constantly remember how strong we were in Valderrame; we had a strong lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrame we won, but only like that,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning 5-3 on Friday in 2018 and last night at Le Golf National.
So the story shows me and everyone else in this way that the game is not yet over.
Tomorrow we'll go full throttle.
We will stand on the grass and do everything right.
Until the points are on the board, the match is not over.
Our goal is to win this prize. We must be careful to do this.
As I said from the beginning, I’m aiming for 12 players on our side, but I’m also aware that we’re facing the other side – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about his players’ success at the demanding golf game, Bjorn added: “I would never have done it before.
We'll have another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow it will be about individual performances, and this is something completely different.
It’s great to have a good time with your partner when you’re having fun. But if you’re standing up for yourself, this will test all your golf skills.
This is the message that players must remember to get the best of tomorrow.
Now leave your partner, and he must come and get the best of you. ”
Distinct from Bjorn, fellow player Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than individuals, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the great tournaments in the last days, being a partaker of the victor in Brooklyn before he was defeated when Europe attained the “Miracle of Medina.”
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players until the last day in 1999.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to start as quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
But if this impulse should run in one direction, it matters exceedingly in the midst of the strifes.
having formed the habitation of us, and having placed the boys in such a manner as we thought to-morrow, to try a propitiation some to-morrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and faced Rory McIlroy in the highest match, with the rest of Europe, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the upper half of the game.
"I went with this group of boys in this council, because I thought we would go all this way," Bjorn said of the selection of our individuals.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again
According to local media reports, the newest frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 as a replacement for aging warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and the accumulation of cargo.
The introduction to the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered after being delivered by worrisome problems.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg triad, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will come as replacements for the aging frigates of the Bremen triad.
For it is known that they will contain works of power, the advice of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain technologies of concealment, such as reduced radar reflectivity, and infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important functions include a longer maintenance schedule, which might allow the newest frigates to be deployed outside their home ports for up to two years.
But this unceasing disputation means that the state-of-the-art warships, which enabled Germany to exercise her power overseas, will become obsolete by the time they enter the country, reports Die Zeit.
Last year, the ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to bring the vessel into the liner and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned the ship to the builder after it had been delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned several major “software and hardware glitches” that made the warship useless for a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ship would be escorted by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship was found to be significantly overweight, which reduces its power and limits the Navy’s ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as the similar triad of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project becomes a problem - the crew training is returned.
It is said to have reached an astounding EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) – up from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems afflicting the newest frigates are of particular importance in view of the recent warnings that the German naval power is diminishing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, confirmed that the navy does not have “ships capable of deploying”.
But the captain of the ship said, This question was overturned in the course of time; for the old ships were taken out of the ship, and there were no replacements for the ships.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg triad had been able to make it into the navy.
The National Trust reveals the secret life of bats
Now a new plan is being carried out in the country of Scotland. It is planned to show how bats use the land to catch food.
We hope that the events will shed new light on the management of the unique flying mammals and help direct future conservation activities.
A study of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the whistling bats and the sand bats, as well as the bright and water bats in the gardens of Inverewe in the Wester Ross area.
Special notepads are placed in key locations around inertia to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
The workers in this organization and the volunteers will also carry out mobile hand-held scanners.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings obtains the frequency of bat calls and the activity of individual species.
And they will make a map of their natural habitat and of their government, to give a detailed picture of their administration on a vast scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of nature are the most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help you determine the benefits of working for a better life. It will help you determine the benefits of working for a better life. It will also help you to protect the forests of those who live in those areas. It is best to protect the forests of those who live in those areas where bats and other kinds of wild animals live.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last year.
They are threatened by construction and development works, which have an impact on grassy growth and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flywheels and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats, can also be a danger.
But bats are not blind by nature.
But because of their night-time habits of hunting, their ears are like eyes, for their gain is hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to pinpoint insects and block their flight path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct examinations, inspection of assemblies, and sometimes rescues.
It was then that the first and only protected area for bats was established. The first and only protected area was the area of Threeveh in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of immobility, David Thompson, says that the lordship is an ideal territory for them.
"We have here in Thrave a wonderful bat-priest," he said.
“We have old buildings, many protected trees, and all good biotopes.
But there are still many things we do not know about bats, so that the work we are doing here and there will help us to understand better the things that need to be done to survive. ”
It points out that it is important to control bats before performing maintenance in a state of inertia, since it is possible that the unwitting destruction of one mother’s assembly could kill up to 400 females and cubs, which would probably destroy the entire population of the city.
But bats are kept, and it is unlawful to kill, or to mistreat, or to disturb, or to destroy.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish councillor for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved in the relief effort.
And she said, “We still have much to learn about our bats, and about many of our companions we do not know how their populations live. ”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, but lawyers have filed a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the allegations of rape “fake news” and says that people want to “be seen” by his name.
His lawyers are bringing charges against Der Spiegel, a German magazine, which has made the charges public.
A Portuguese footballer and Juventus forward has been accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid him $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, the magazine Der Spiegel reportedly said.
A few hours after the indictment was made public, Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million followers during a live interview on Instagram, calling the charges “fake administrations.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false government," the five-time Golden Ball winner said to the camera.
“They want to be made known by my name. ”
It's normal.
They want to be famous because they can use my name. But this is what I do.
"I'm a happy man and everything's in order," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine over what they called "an inadmissible report of suspected privacy concerns."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages at the level of the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was supposed to take place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, they reportedly went back to the player’s room after the shooting at the Ronaldo and Mayorga nightclub, where he allegedly butt-raped her.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who cheated on "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also said she went into the field and took a photo of her wound in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "feared of retribution" and feared "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reassess the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this year moved to the Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret forever’ loss of carmakers
The UK would “forever regret” losing its status as a world leader in post-Brexit automotive manufacturing, trade secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnastone plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of border crossings in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the surplus of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s executive driver in Burnastone.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its little race in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers say is a risk to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just in time” basis, with components arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a breach of the border, which could lead to shortcomings and lack of cooperation.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than the daily value of its stock at its Derbyshire plant, so that the company would lose control and production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for a future relationship with the EU was "previously calibrated to prevent these border checks".
“We have to have a deal, and we want to have the best deal that allows us not to talk about success at the same time, but to grasp the opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must be perfectly able to continue what has been a very successful assembly of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would stop, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Trade Union in the race, said that his members are becoming more and more concerned: “According to my experience, when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.
Said the oracle of the government, We have put before us an exact and faithful plan for our coming relations with the UE.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed to next week” as the battle for the Supreme Court continues for the nomination of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and a potential frenzy of investigations by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire a deputy attorney general, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, Washington has been gossiping for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wiretapping conversations with Trump and recalling the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed this administration.
Last Monday he went to the White House. There was news that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting was held on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “preferred” not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting broke down to avoid a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified to.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, setting aside a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
And when they had asked her about Rosenstein, she said, “The time has not been set for this. It could be this week. I understand that it is postponed to another week in regard to all the other things that are being done in connection with the supreme judgment.
We will see and we are always happy to inform the press.”
Some reporters vehemently denied this: Sanders had not held a brief White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of short bursts of pressure was not caused by opposition to the television reporters who wanted to be dazzled, though she said, “I don’t agree with the fact that they want to be dazzled. ”
Then she suggested that there should be more direct contact between Trump and the pressure.
"The president is making more conceptual-based statements and will answer questions like any other president before him," she added, without giving any evidence, "we'll look at those numbers."
Short press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States of America a question directly, it's incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and in the last few weeks you have seen us often indeed, there will be a short press conference when you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president might have been able to demonstrate, and why, having appeared freely and often bizarrely before the assembled press, he did so.
Health officials at the European Union's National Health Service in Scotland write about concerns over Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU staff working for the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of the application for permanent residence of EU citizens working in its transferred public service.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “During the year, there continued to be discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union about leaving, which were heading towards the expected decisions for the autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also made preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know that it must be a very troublesome time for all of you.
So now I want to tell you again how much I appreciate each worker’s contribution without regard for the number of soldiers he has.
Our colleagues from all over the European Union and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the medical community and to benefit the patients and the communities we serve.

Christion Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State Reed, the head coach, told reporters that he was injured shortly before halftime.
“He went into a different place, ” Reed said,“ and somehow he fell. ”
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of his neck before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Health Center.
Harris added that there were “no details yet as to the type/range of the injury” and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year university student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On the Saturday before leaving the game, he had five total hits, bringing him a total of 18 hits this season.
There will be a higher tax for foreign buyers when they buy incorruptibility in the United Kingdom
There will be a higher tax for those who buy things from other countries. They will buy what is right in the kingdom of heaven. That way, the new plans of the conservatives will give them more money to help the homeless.
This move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will be taken from the people who do not pay their taxes in the kingdom of heaven.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that she will charge a higher price to foreign buyers when she buys a permanent home in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and high-income housing.
The tax increase will be collected from the tax collectors and from the non-taxable corporations in the United Kingdom, and it will be used to support the government in its fight against sleeping on the streets.
The extra money that was added to the higher rates that were introduced two years ago, in addition to the tax that was levied on other houses, and the rent that was made after the purchase of a house, could be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects that this step will bring financial resources of up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built inertia buys non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-timers to get into the habitation system.
Many rich regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become “city of spirits ” because of the large number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the cost of living, in order to help the young people more to own their first home.
He accused the big building companies of holding up the prices of intemperance by fighting over the ground but not using it. He called on May to abandon the quotas for the available dwelling, in order to make up for Britain’s “shame on living.”
Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms to reinstate checks on the tenants and end the "no-fault" removal.
At the same time, it wants to give the committees more power to build new homes.
Maya said, “Last year I told you that I would dedicate my life to making the British dream come true. I told you that life would be better for each new generation.
This means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build their lives here. ”
However, we cannot allow it to be as easy for individuals not living in the United Kingdom as it is for communities abroad to buy homes as it is for the hard-working British people.
“For because of too many people the dream of owning a house has become too remote, and the disgrace of sleeping in the street remains too real. ”
Jack Ross: ‘My main ambition is to run Scotland’
Sunderland football boss Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become a manager of Scotland in a certain team.
The 42-year-old <0xC5><0xA0>kot enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, currently in third place in the League One competition, three points from first place.
This year he moved to the Stadium of Light after joining the Premier League with Team St Mirren last season.
“I wanted to play for my country like a player.
I got a baseball cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But as a child I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father, and this is what always attracted me.
But this opportunity will come to me if I succeed in governing the club. ”
Among Ross' predecessors as manager are Patria Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team boss Alloa Athletic says he has no fear of being followed in such a large club by such a respected name, having previously swept away the offers from the Barnsley and Ipswich Town teams.
“For me, success will be measured by the team, whether I can ‘bring this club back to the Premier League’.
“Because of the structure and equipment, this club is definitely in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could get a club there. ”
Ross is only three years in his responsibilities, after a stint as an assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a Hearts coaching staff.
Then he helped Allo to recover from his descent into the third league and changed St Mirren from the edge of the descent to the championship title winner next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
'It was probably a real fork in the road, 'said Alloa as he entered the team.
“I truly believed that the management was better for me than the boundaries.
This is bizarre, because I have done well and have secured for myself a standard of living appropriate to myself, and have enjoyed some reasonable living.
But the food you eat can be very heavy.
There are many things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I feel good in management.
I have always wanted to do what was right, and I am sure I am doing it now. I have never done it before in my whole life. ”

Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a beer cup is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat increased sales in British survival-fighting pubs, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the cramps and bars sector recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but sales in restaurateurs decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business adviser who provided the data, said: “The continued sunshine and the longer than expected participation of the Englishwoman in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend as the previous month, with sales increasing by 2.8 percent year-on-year.
The decrease of 1.8% in restaurateur services in June only worsened in July.
And the inn and the bar having been given to drink, much better than the rest, which on account of equal factors decreased.
And let us eat and drink, though not so dramatically as the restaurateurs.
It seems that the men were only wanting to go out for a drink.
Within the cramped bars and bars, the sales of drinks for this month increased by 6.6%, and the food decreased by three percent.
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and influence of large social or sports activities remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling on the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurateur groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly painful in the face of continuing cost pressures.
The long hot year could not come at a worse time to those who were bringing food, because the time will show whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide the relief we need. ”
The total growth of sales in taverns and restaurateurs returned to the newly opened stores in July was 2.7%, reflecting a decrease in the introduction of stamps.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for British buckling, bars and restaurateurs collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of more than 9 billion British pounds and is an established standard in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
The investigation revealed that one in five children, some under the age of 11, had secret accounts on social media, hiding them from their parents and teachers.
An appeal among 20,000 middle school students has revealed a rise in “fake Instagram accounts”
Administrations have raised concerns that sexual content is being made public
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “master account” that they would show to their parents.
One in five children, some under the age of 11, accounts for themselves on social media and keeps them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Instagram accounts” – a page for taking photos.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being made public.
Twenty percent of the students agreed that they were doing a good work. They were doing a good work. They were showing their parents what was wrong. And they were showing their own parents what was wrong.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage girl urging others to rape her.
A survey carried out by the Digital Leadership Organisations in the UK and the Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 has two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private profiles.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the radiating body as a non-executive radiator.
Doyle is the most successful female athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for the riad sportspeople to take advantage of her international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has great respect among the Scottish, British and world athletics communities, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from bringing her to the board of directors,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, “I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to make a real contribution in helping to lead the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has four Olympic gold medals and is a regular BBC commentator, has suffered a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a death.
I couldn't walk.
And the doctors said, “The time will tell if I will be healed, and to what extent. ”
It is a hard work, but I have been completely healed. I have learned to walk again, and today I am doing my training in the new way of living.
Thank you for the encouraging management!”
An advertisement for a breast milk pump comparing mothers with cows divides opinions in the online world
The company for the production of breast milk extractors has divided opinions in the online world by advertising that compares nursing mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the “world’s quietest breast milk pump” mentioned above, Elvia, a consumer technology company, has released an ad inspired by a music video from the city of Potmehud to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
The four real mothers dance in the hay, a barn full of cows, with songs that say, “Yes, I’m sifting out milk, but you don’t see a tail. ” They also say,“ If you haven’t noticed, these are my breasts. ”
The chorus continues, “I pump, I pump, I feed so much, I pump, I pump, I pump, I suck my beauties.”
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has opened a polemic in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video drew mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it disparaged the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just as we have need of pregnant women to give birth so that they can produce milk, except that we will steal their children away from them within a few days of giving birth, ” wrote one woman.
The breast pump from Elvie is conveniently stored in a baby bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another user commented: “It is understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Yes, and why should they not be used for the purpose of setting forth a breast-milk pipe for mothers who leave their children behind? <0xC2><0xAB>
Someone else added, “Advertising detached from reality.”
Others were defending the ad, and one woman admitted that the song seemed to be a gift to her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would buy a breast pump if I were still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was sucking milk.
The ad is a little crazy, but I take it as it is.
It’s a brilliant product,” one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “Amusing advertising aimed at moms who suck milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’”
This is not advertising that glorifies or judges the products of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with discreet breast milk pumps tucked into their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on an understanding of the fact that many women who breastfeed say that they feel like cows.
But the breast-milk extractor of Elvia is completely silent, and has neither cords nor tubes, and fits discreetly into a breast-muff, which gives women liberty of movement to hold their children, and to suck them even, and to spend their time without.
Ana Balarinová, partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development programme commented: “The Elvie breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves to be boldly and provocatively placed on the market.
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and the milking cows, we wanted to put the extraction of breast milk and all its appeals in the center of our attention, but in a fun and telling way we wanted to demonstrate the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s vacuum cleaner has been featured in headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children, Marta Jakubowska, used this product as a presenter of a prayer for the designer.
And hundreds of the children of those who had come into the country moved peacefully into a tent-camp on the border of Texas.
The number of immigrant children held in detention has increased, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and practices introduced by the Trump administration have undermined the placement of children by those who support them.
Traditionally, most of those who supported them were illegal immigrants themselves, and they were afraid that they might jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking their children along with them.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints and that data would be tampered with by immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the government had arrested dozens of people who had asked for the support of unaccompanied minors.
The Office subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the supporter’s household are here in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with a criminal record.
So we continue to monitor these individuals," Mr Albence said.
The magistrates, seeking to settle matters concerning the children more quickly, have presented new rules which will require some of them to be brought before the court within one month of their arrest, and not after 60 days, as was the standard before, to be brought in by the workers at the shelter.
Many will make themselves known by means of a video conference call, not by themselves, so that they may bring their case before the judge for the sake of the citizenship, according to the legal standing.
Those who are classified as not eligible for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are held, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can result in violence or attempts to flee. These are the ones who were taken into custody by the workers at the inn and by the authorities who have been in charge of the system for the past months.
But the lawyers found that these fears were increasing in a greater institution, such as that of Tornillo, where the signs that the child was suffering were being overlooked because of the greatness of the institution.
They added that moving the children to a tent city without giving them enough time to be emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to their friends could cause the trauma that many are struggling with.
Syria will tell US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who addressed the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally deployed in Syria’s countryside on the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“Immediately, ” he said to the crowd,“ and without making any changes, the people will leave you. ”
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost at an end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until it clears all Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and an “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and radioing Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war-torn country.
Concerning the question of those who had fled, Moualem said that the pretexts were appropriate for their return, and he accused the “no one in the land of the west” of “spreading irrational fear” leading those who had fled to remain outside their homes.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and Europe have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a widespread attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists returning fighters from the Nusra front allied with al-Qaeda, which "will be removed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to “revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warning of interventions.
Why Trump will get a second functional period
By this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, even though many liberal viewers are likely to hope that his presidential office will prematurely end the indictment and scandal.
That would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale ever”!
But there is no sign of weariness on the part of the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of hours spent on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has almost doubled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show” has a top-notch rating with up to 3.5 million viewers in prime time.
“This is a binder that draws people in because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, creator of the ABC’s drama program The President on Advice, about a secretive government that will become president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy/relational author of Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
Before the elections in 2016, he remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why? ” she asked.
He said, "because he's funny," Scovell told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, apart from everything else on television, stories from Washington can tell the future of the Roe v. Wade controversy, whether the immigrant families will be able to reunite and have a healthy global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
However, it is beyond an informed citizen when you find that for six hours you are watching an interview of a group of experts about a “deeper background” as the sources of the book “Fear” by Bob Woodward, a bomber leather jacket by Paul Manafort from the ostrich worth 15,000 dollars (“rough piece of clothing with Trump’s arrogance, and Daniel’s arrogance”).
For example, I will never look at Super Mary the same way again.
“Part of what he does is reminiscent of a reality show that feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the “Pawn Stars” series, about the day-to-day dispatch of Trump’s show, with a recurring theme show and a recurring theme song.
You cannot afford to miss a single episode, because you would have been left behind.
When I went to see Lord Fleiss that week, it was sunny 26 degrees outside on the north bank of Kauai, but he stayed inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
And not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was set before the senate tribunal, was able to separate himself from this, and the future of the high court was uncertain.
“I remember in the past when we used to do all these crazy things and people would say, ‘ This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’ ” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the bell comes into the election for a seat in the middle of the functional period
Unsurprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of the congressional districts, which resulted in two runners fighting for one seat.
This recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th arrondissement of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th arrondissement.
The maps were made after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th arrondissement touched off campaign funding between the party’s main financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a widely watched March special election to the 18th congressional district in Pennsylvania.
The city was held by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators have given Democrats a moderate lead.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador Instead of Supporting China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a slight deviation from Washington.
Trump took part in a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, while partners did not promote Trump’s riadia by organizing it.
Foreign affairs officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement at the start of the month.
But the sanctions were taken into account only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received assistance in an estimated amount of 140 million US dollars returned to drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and a vehement visa ban, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to build on a similar one last year, seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any assessment of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now attend the conference, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October, according to diplomats, as a sign of the importance of the meeting that the administration is giving him.
The U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new serious administrations or punishments from Washington.
But he refused to comment on the details of the discussion to Lord Bolton, who was informed by three U.S. officials and two diplomats who had agreed to discuss the matter privately on the pretext of anonymity.
Their administration was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the pretext of anonymity.
Studying History
Another unexpected event could be the administration of special adviser Robert Mueller about a possible obstruction of justice for President Trump, which now has substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation on whether Trump’s campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Mr. Trump would face accountability in this body just as he is preparing to go before the voters again, and possibly the jury of his Dementors.
That’s a lot to take in, not to say that Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor his equivalent in Europe.
Each one of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice of how the power to wage war is able to exercise its power.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, but the West would have to resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Mn<0xC3><0xAD>chov.
We did not succeed in doing this, and we left out an opportunity to escape by going through the year of slaughter that followed.
Now Priebe, a man active in the faith, has turned about such inflection points, and the inexorable march of democracy has become less and less effective.
Americans are now facing some of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein got into trouble when it was announced in this administration that he had proposed a covert recording of the president last year, speculating about his inability to exercise office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' press coverage is inconclusive.
“How shall we react if F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested trial is not complete or just? Or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court on charges of sexual harassment and dishonesty?
First of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the functional period in the Congress, which will hold Trump accountable?
But if we fail in these tests, the democracies will be laid up for a good night’s rest.
I believe that we are not lost because of the teaching that I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial house.
She survived and came to America. 60 years later, she sent me to set a lamp on the Sabbath table with the cross on it.
With a past like this, I have to be an optimist."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team feels optimistic about meeting with Rapid Vieden
With this, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they know that defeating the Austrians in an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League competition.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from presenting for the first time of the season after a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for more.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good point,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and believed that we could win something, so we went out with a point.
Perhaps we were able to succeed in the end, but overall the draw was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
It will be another great European night on Thursday.
We hope to win three points, but it will be a difficult game, because they did well in their last game. But I am sure that we will be able to push them and get a positive result with the believers who are behind us.
Last year was hard because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now the factor is why we feel good.
He's good at that, and the boys are really enjoying it, and we've got great training.
Let’s hope that we can now put a stop to last season and be successful.”
Women do not sleep because they are afraid, because they are joined to a woman who has no breasts.
Some of the people at the meeting had a clear idea of what they wanted to do. But only a few of the people in the meeting talked with the people in their families.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study were persuaded to spend a long time talking with their partners about the expense of caring for them.
Only 10 percent found out that they had spoken to their children about this.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t take steps to talk,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide.
Here's the point to start.
Talk to your partner and your children. You cannot make your family grow unless you tell them what you want them to do.
Work together with your counselors and family members to determine where and how you should spend your time, because this choice can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor. Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your ability to finance your debts because of your long-term care can consist of a traditional, long-term, materialistic agreement, a hybrid, materialistic agreement about life, which will help cover these expenses or provide for yourself with your own property — as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the cross.
Get a health care professional to appoint a trustworthy person to oversee your health care and to ensure that the professionals can carry out your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
Also consider the strength of a legal representative for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and secure the payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent requires prompt medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you may be ready.
“It’s not just the money, but also who will be the doctors? ” asked Martin.

Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan in place.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The officials said that the number of victims was expected to rise.
As a result of the impasse, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain information from the regent’s office in Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the towns of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, the administrative region of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The province has a high level of nickel mining, but most of it is located in the district of Morawali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi River.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami struck the western part of the city of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes hit it regularly.
These are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in the last years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 lands and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami with a height of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the regency of Pidia Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic when it reminded people of the nine deadly earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
Now there has not yet been a tsunami of doom, but more than a hundred people have died as a result of the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused the temporary detention of thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the administration of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the Alaskan state police.
According to the police department, when his friend tried to call the police to report the crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody in Mat-Su and is being held for an uncovered bond of $500, KTUU TV reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading not guilty, as he had said in his defense, the TV station said.
Palin faces three offenses of the class A, which means that he could be imprisoned for up to one year and receive a fine of 250,000 dollars.
He was also charged with a B-class offense and was punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in the administration of domestic violence and possession of weapons while he was in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
And his friend was seduced, because he had struck her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent handling to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake with tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power grids and communication networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media videos are circulating that show the eyes of a person being struck.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a crippling sentence that hasn’t been commuted to state prison for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented, high-cost Home Depot vehicle on Oct. 31 to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side in lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists on the route.
According to the announcement of the commencement of the death penalty trial in the Southern District of New York, if prosecutors want to achieve the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipo’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury of investigators indicted Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with intent to extort, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and destroyed the motorcade.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded deliberation,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s conduct as “abominable, cruel, and perverted.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, distress and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Dada<0xC5><0xBE>m<0xC3><0xAD>r."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last imposed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, and in September 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. The couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were electrocuted on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done and that he had watered the fields.
According to the indictment, Saipov said he was instigating the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia said he had also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
With 22 points, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a guilty plea and a life spent in prison without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage famously promised at a conservative conference that he would “mobilize the army of men.”
A former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to “face an unpleasant situation” from eurosceptics when a member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested he be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative Councillor Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the United Kingdom would have been “already gone” if Mr Farage had been the Brexiteer.
But the challenge that Mrs May was facing in reconciling her deeply divided councils was borne out by the Conservatives, who were of the opinion that she should endure, who joined in the independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, pro-Brexit supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr Bone told a Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to remove the prime minister.
And he ordered Farage, the lord, to be associated with him, and to be responsible for his dealings with Brussels.
"If he were in his old age, we would be out," he said.
A member of parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we need to remove the prime minister.”
He disagreed with the EU and said, “We did not fight the world’s wars in order to be in submission.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone was of the opinion that since the vote in 2016 the public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling reporters: “I say this simply: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The prime minister is unpopular with the public at large, and the opposition will not vote for her. This is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and taking us to the front.
Please leave the Prime Minister alone and start listening.”
But she added, “The prime ministers keep their seats, because they keep their promises. ”
Farage told the gathering that politicians must "feel anger" if they betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us - the people - and our political triad," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow them to do that. ”
He added: “I want our political trio, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger.”
“We are mobilising the people of this land who have given us the victory over Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom. ”
And it came to pass, that, while they were marching through Birmingham for the sake of persevering, they assembled in the midst of the city for two hours.
A crowd of activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit, a group that was formed this weekend.
A member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives for security problems with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the men who tell us that they are able to have established information systems and all the techniques to the point of no friction, and to the willing trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says she plans to ‘think carefully’ about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that she could beat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s rally in Holyoke was her 36th meeting in the city hall since Trump took office.
He asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was "time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that requires a woman on the pinnacle of the fast."
Arrested in the shooting of Sims from LSU
A police raid in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that it had arrested the suspected shooter of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
They shared a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help in identifying the man who was caught on video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near Southern University boarding school on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the network of 247sports.
Wayde went to help his friend, and Simpson shot him.
And being examined, Simpson confessed that he was present, and having his weapon in his hand, and confessed to shooting Wayden the Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
The two-meter junior player, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches with 10 starts last season with a lead of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton is close to a world title after his orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was announced that Mercedes’ orders will play a significant role in the forerunners.
From the best starting position, Bottas got a good start and almost put Hamilton in an unpleasant situation, defending his position in the first two turns and urging Vettel to attack his teammate.
First Vettel went into the boxes, and then Hamilton was allowed to go in at the mouth of the group, which was going to be the decisive one.
Mercedes went to the pits by a lap later and went out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close run, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend himself a third time after a double pull.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen began his work as a leader in the last group. He was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He was leading a large part of the race. He was holding on to the road. His aim was to finish the race quickly. He was ahead of Kimi Raikkonen. He finished fourth in the race.
Finally he reached the pits in the 44th lap, but he could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri had worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me pass.
"He's done an exceptional job, he's got an exceptional combination of two strong personalities," Hamilton said.
It was indeed an evil word of the flesh.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday after urging her not to disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead noting that what was happening in the Senate had shown people to be “tremendous, disgusting, and dishonest.”
He said, “One thing may happen, and another beautiful thing is happening in the last days in the Senate. You see the anger when you see people being angry, and greedy, and hateful, and dishonest. ”
When you see those who were seen and those who were escaping, they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it! ”
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make this public?
Remember her answer... you have made the document public – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't disclose it."
All right, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and the letter was made public in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't tell her the story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill newspaper reported.
“She asked me to be confident, and I kept it just as she asked me. ”
But her disapproval did not seem to suit the president, who said during the Sabbath meeting, “I’m telling you something that really was an evil message spoken by the flesh.
Perhaps she did not do this, but she spoke the worst thing that I have ever seen of her! ”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president hinted that Democrats were using the allegations for their own bodies.
saying, “They are determined to take charge of everything they need.
You see wickedness, indecency, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to beat in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite reported on the president’s statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals behind the Giants against the Dundee hockey team
In doing so, Dundee Stars made up for a loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
In doing so, the Giants gained an early two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, the home team equalized, but Dwyer subsequently reinstated the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied Dundee for it, but subsequently gave Lukas Lundvald Nielsen two goals that secured their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season to Adam Keefe's men, who turned the score and defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time in a row that the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came at 3:35 a.m. with Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford four minutes later, when Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the busy opening sequence, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured Cownie's settlement at 15:16.
Dwyer saw to it that Giants took the lead in the first stop, when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalized again by scoring a goal in a 27:37 game without a goalkeeper.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead the Dundee team in the second half for the first time in the game, and he took care of the victory in the half of the last part.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home in Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to secure flight escape with hundreds of passengers from grounding
Now the pilot of a company in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died, having made a safe take-off of an aircraft carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died, many of them unfaithful, after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
The area is still troubled by powerful earthquakes, and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in a wildly moving swinging tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed where he was, to make sure that the flight of 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at that time, would take off safely.
And he leaped out of the chariot, supposing that he would fall.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia’s air navigation spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning when the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We were greatly distressed when we learned of this," he said.
At the same time, experts fear that the number of victims could reach thousands. The Disaster Mitigation Agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The number is likely to increase continually, because many bodies were still under the rubble, and we were not able to reach many people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the agency.
And the waves, reaching as high as six meters, overthrew the city of Palus, where there was a mass funeral held on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance ties up a body every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The small markets are everywhere plundered.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “In Indonesian, the Red Cross is hurrying to help others, but we don’t know what we will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse. ”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s army, “I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
The earthquake struck Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accidents in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, one man is unfaithful after a plane crash in the lagoon
This is what the group of airlines says. They were in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia when they crashed. They said there was one man who was not safe. He had already told them that all 47 people on the road and all the people on the plane were safely evacuated from the place where the plane was going to sink.
Now Air Niugini ’ s company made it clear that on the Sabbath day they found that one man was missing.
Now it has been revealed to the aeronautics community that they are working with the local authorities, the hospitals, and the investigators to find this man.
The airline company did not immediately respond to a request for more specific information about the traveler, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island.
On Friday the officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
Now the aeronautical community reported that on the Sabbath day there were six travelers in the hospital who were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft had landed in the lagoon before the runway began.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a U.S. traveler, said the plane was flying very low.
'It was a great happiness, 'Jaynes said.
“He and others, ” said Jaynes,“ have been able to pass through deep water to the place where there is no food, even though the ark is sinking. ”
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy learned that sailors who worked nearby to improve the moth helped with the help of an inflatable boat, which tied people to the shore before the aircraft sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network database indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst determines the timeline of the night during which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday wrapped up the charges in a re-opening case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an American analyst with the Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of justice analysis.
He plotted for the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and that he was with Chambers, she spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on the Sabbath and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville.
But there was another contradiction, that Tellis said that he had known Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The records of the mobile phones showed that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Jessica Chambers, Tellis deleted her administrations, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the judgment would be held on that day before the judges.

Another black woman?!
New York City Babysitter Sues Couple for Dismissal for ‘Racist’ Text Management
A New York City babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a text message incorrectly sent from her mother claiming she was “another black woman.”
Some deny that they are racists, but compare the charges against them to “strikes.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, made the right decision when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
“NIEEEEEEE, <0xC4><0x8C>ERNO<0xC5><0xA0>KA” was written by Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in the text management to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after the “shameful” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman had made her acquaintance, Mrs. Maurice was thrown out and told that their outgoing nurse, an African-American woman, had taken away their evil work and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to the Ubers.
Ms. Maurice is now suing for a few dollars a day in compensation for her dismissal from work, and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the period of six months, for the work she has done, including lodging with the employer whom she was originally hired to do without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
But some of them said they were racist and defended themselves. They said it was a good idea to stop working for Mrs. Maurice because they were afraid they could not trust her after the trouble she had been given.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say. ”
She's not a racist.
We must not be racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post newspaper.
“But do you give your children into the hands of anyone against whom you were harsh, even though they were in error?
Your newborn baby?
But go."
Comparing the accusation against him with that of beating him, Plasco declared that his wife had a child only two months old, and that she was in a very difficult situation.
“Would you go after someone like that?
It's not a very nice thing," the investment banker added.
But now a legal dispute is still going on, and the public hastened to condemn the couple on social media, arguing over their conduct and logic.
The new paper reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the readers would have nothing to do with the bear that was talking.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said about this letter: “It is hard to find someone who has read this before it is published.
It is very amusing to know what we now know of Paddington's tremendous success."
She said that the father was an optimist in regard to the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about the little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet" because of his death last year.
She added that Paddington’s success, described as “a very important member of our family,” made his father quietly proud.
"He was a quiet man, and not a boaster," she said.
“But because Paddington was so devoted to him, it was almost as if you had a child of your own; you are proud of him, even though it is not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his representation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad, that he didn't expect to make it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then he called me and said, ‘ He will die in the next two days, and I must say goodbye to her. ’
And I did.
I said, ‘ Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
We'll be with you soon.
We'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors were giving her to keep her heart working were slowly dying, leaving her system.
She died a little while ago, and this is how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or shout or cry, because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was grieving over the loss of her daughter, got into the airplane with the rest of those who were traveling, and did not fear the suffering she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“All the time I was downcast, I was crying.
It is hard to explain, but I felt so much compassion for Nada while I was on the flight.
I know that he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her. ”
Links of grieving women prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women have come to kill themselves. They are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up links to a Welsh bridge with insidious administrations and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
“They always said, ‘ His smile will make every place shine. ’
But he gave up his work before he died, because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found a relative of his after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's going to have a chain effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
A longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, a partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt bad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before the Vianacs, we noticed a change in his mood.
Now it was the day of the feast, which was all over, when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look at them, nor at anything else.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: “It will cause the whole family to die.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future isn't the same as the FBI's investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he wanted, whether it was a time or a limited amount of time, we might agree on something," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would "disintegrate" amid obstacles.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is caused by timing.
But there are only five weeks between now and the end of the service. On November 6th, if the Republicans don’t succeed as expected, their efforts to bring the man they have chosen to the highest court in the land will greatly weaken.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI drafts the executive order?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the tie and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been falling since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry for Unification, noted that there were 1,127 defectors last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park saw that the key factors were the tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher fees charged by the translators.
Pyongyang has not made any public remarks.
Finally, the great majority of the deserters from the north will offer themselves to the people of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters more as illegal migrants than as refugees and often as forced returnees.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the representatives of both countries met in Pyongyang because of the discussions that had been held against the denuclearization negotiations.
This came after U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un’s historic meeting in Singapore in June, when they agreed in broad terms to work on a nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was caused by U.S. sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical,” says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suited to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke during an interview Saturday at the Texas Dictionaries Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did it, they'd say she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional at the time of his opening statement, and at times he almost screamed and choked to death as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He specifically condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated type of assassination" orchestrated by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Ms. Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony could prove that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he appeared to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself for these statements and the way he's harassing the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi turned away and was asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if his nominations were confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you one thing, unless he's telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only fit to be on the Supreme Court, he's not fit to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or, in the case of Roe v. Wade, because she considered herself a conservative judge.
And Kavanaugh began to question in his hearings whether he would reverse some of the rulings of the Supreme Court.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, preoccupied man to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Well, isn’t this wonderful?’ ” said Pelosi.
And women have to control it.
This is a justified attack, and months and years of wrath, which cannot be restrained, nor can she speak of without weeping.
"When we are angry, we cry," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She said, “A woman who worked as a manager helped me a lot. She said that she also cried because she was angry. But she began to use the procedure, because she was angry and began to cry. So she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad.
I am angry.’
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great."
Tears are partly released as a way out of God’s anger, because they are completely out of place.
One of my fondest memories from my early employment in the chief men's office, where I once wept with indescribable fury, was when an older woman, a cold manager, whom I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know that you are angry.
They think that you are sad. They will be happy because you have put them under your skin. "
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his fight for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called the Monkey Business and ended her candidacy, the deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not pursue the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already in the running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snehulienka and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already begun, and since it was lagging behind in terms of funding, she promised not to enter the game unless she had received $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given the men $1,000, were willing to give her only $250.
“Do you think that I have left him? ” she asked.
While they were talking about not starting an official campaign, they were filled with so much emotion — gratitude to the people who supported them, frustration with the system that made it so hard to get money to have sex with people who voted for them, and so much more so than to show it to the delegates.
"You might have thought I was a nervous wreck," Mrs. Schroeder said of the backlash.
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember that I used to think about what I would write on my tomb.
"The one who cried?"
How can a trade war between the U.S. and China be good for Beijing?
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been blasphemous, and the battle is not far off; the conflict between the countries may be a long-term gain for Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning early this year by taxing key Chinese exports of returned solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of items (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has paid back in the same way every time. Lately, tariffs have come in the amount of five to ten percent per load, worth $60 billion.
China has promised to come to terms with U.S. tactics, and the world’s second-largest economy is likely to follow suit.
Reaching a concession from Washington would be to meet the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public adoration of the US would be even more distressing.
In contrast, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could, in the long run, positively support China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create subterfuge that causes economic turmoil in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than we have previously seen,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher with the Center for Asian Studies.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the devastated land, more than a seven-year war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation here is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
Now all conditions exist for the voluntary return of the refugees to the land, which they were forced to abandon because of terrorism and the unilateral provisions of the economy, which were applied to their daily lives and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
And another six million who are still in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated countryside.
And he declared that he would not accept foreign aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europa confirms victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
In Europe, the 2018 Ryder Cup was won by a US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost the Ryder Cup six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown once again, giving Danish captain Thomas Bjorn the 14.5 points he needed to surpass the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who did not do well in most tournaments, blew his first shot into the water on the 16th hole with par 3 and gave up his match in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Taliansky, a Molinari golfer, shined in all his laps and became one of the four players who have played 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth is the lowest-ranked player in Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, defeated 2 and 1 Englishman Ian Poulter, who could play in his last tournament Ryder Cup.
<0xC3><0x93>smich tournament veteran of the Ryder Cup, <0xC5><0xA0>paniel Sergio Garcia, became the record-breaking European tournament winner with a career-high score of 25.5.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very happy that the cup is returned to us.
It's about that. I'm happy that I was able to help," Garcia said, feeling strongly after the European victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who overcame the American golf legend Tiger Woods with two holes in the remaining hole in the game of individuals on Sunday.
"When Tiger Woods was defeated, I felt incredible pride; I grew up watching this guy," said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournament record.
Special statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American fought all weekend to find his way, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk stood up after a disappointing performance in front of his "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
The time has come this morning when they have made Europe uncomfortable.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will re-create the group, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be a captain.
Hats off.
You have defeated us."
Current state of red sludge: Concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasote
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s latest report shows a general decline in red sludge concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, there are reports of a patchwork of conditions indicating a declining concentration.
The red mud extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast in the Hillsborough area, but there are fewer spots compared to last week.
Red mud was also observed in the Pasco area.
Central concentrations on or off the coast in the Pinellas area were reported last week, low to high concentrations in the seas in the Hillsborough area, high concentrations in the Manatee area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Sarasota area, central concentrations in the Charlotte area and high concentrations outside the Colboze area.
Irritation of the airways continues to occur in the regions of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Irritation to the respiratory tract was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
