It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old man.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom said he would help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
It's gonna take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look cold.
I'm on foot.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the bike?
He is a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not taking advantage of Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them up.
What's it worth?
We were fed up with the water.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He probably still has it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What the hell is this?
No one knows that.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
Tom came back last week.
Everybody was scared.
I've seen it before.
You picked a good one.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Give it back to me.
The wolves attacked the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
You ever shoot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel so alone in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom realizes that he was not a good father, so he tries to make amends.
Tom can't fake it.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little flushed in the cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would respond negatively.
I have to help him.
He criticizes himself.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom's spitting out the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be impertinent with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it, if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one is judging you.
Stop calling Tom names.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewrote the film.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary had hit John.
Tom wrote the report himself.
Are you buying these?
He doesn't look so good.
Hey, can I have that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know that Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you like to sing?
You're lucky.
I have a runny nose every time I catch a cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you can understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Has anyone else entered the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was awful to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still had a price on it.
Tom said he would help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You have to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what it said in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where'd Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Are you paying for the delivery?
I like turnips.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes transmit malaria.
You've been putting this off too long, you're gonna have to finish it tonight!
I don't understand.
That's unfortunate.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also accept cheques.
A newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You got one.
Macedonian has four verb modes: spoken, conditional, commanded, and transmitted.
They are not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are perfect for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we be helping him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How can you not sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started to scream.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a child's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom kicked my ass.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a scandal out of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't attract attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trawler.
Who's on your list?
He has a very good alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I come with you?
Tom's looking pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Make sure you don't get in the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day on which they will try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already been interrogated by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a blond room.
No survivors.
She should have kept quiet.
I'm not like you!
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees, then why are you still alive?”
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I slapped him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom did not answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over 100 people at the party.
This'll cheer you up.
The king was particularly agonized at giving speeches, because of his severe speech impediment.
He did not accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to run away.
He licked himself.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem too busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me scream?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Remove the clamp.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
Didn't you want the prize?
Look at the diminutive.
I'm glad you're happy.
They're insincere.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie yourself up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is a dead end.
We're broke.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you help me just a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the guts to confront Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
That's Tom's.
There's not a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The electric heater heats the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys were descending from the canopy.
Let's forget about it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he abandoned his plans to live abroad.
You're receiving data quickly.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
He's got his sleeve on.
I didn't think you'd like it, Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know it yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They huddled beside him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he was asked to do.
Tom accidentally told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you're going to have to release Tom.
Disgraceful!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia liked the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where should I park?
Does he care about anyone?
How is that your fault?
Tom got a beer out of a bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Does it bother you?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks fell apart.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But he cheated on her.
I am not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did he ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-step process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran down the hill.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Mustard's really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was sweet.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
This happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to leave.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
It's blocked.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What is that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he hoped for.
I just fired them.
That was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom is in serious need of help.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom held out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Curry powder is a mixture of many spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving through town with his brakes up and he didn't notice.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to take Mary off the plan.
Are you planning on staying here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave by now.
People often complain about how they are treated unfairly, not realizing that their own behavior is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you like bowling?
Sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make any noise.
I came here with Tom.
Tom's been completely demoted.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom has made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used foul language.
Your coffee is energizing!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is very good at writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
She no longer felt safe in her own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to give up the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did he leave so suddenly?
We all perceive her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why'd you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I like to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
It was me you wanted to meet, Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom is richer than we thought.
I never meant to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I have no such desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
Carnivores, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom tore his knee.
Where Do Pigeons Come From?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I have a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom stepped forward, and the crowd clapped.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You cook turkey with light bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going to do what he wants me to do.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
He took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a lesson.
I didn't want to be seen.
It is a pity that the concrete does not burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped suddenly.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Drop the bottle.
I'm gonna try and find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm tough.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He always speaks with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
None of the pigs were killed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
The car has four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What good does that do?
That's very helpful.
Tom's phone was vibrating.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open a bagel.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear that.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got what he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for the challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
This is the first bird I’ve seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom looks cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had a nausea and suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front of the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I will do what I know and can do.
I've got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom corrected himself.
Tom tossed the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a lecherous dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst type of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom is living abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up as Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem quite possible.
Thank you for helping him.
She greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved that mystery yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
It's not blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before they are a year old, so they are eaten by humans.
Could you pull that arrow out of my leg?
I had forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that one?
He spends his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on, man.
This book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very bad at muffled sounds. I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you teasing me?
Please, talk to me.
The angels watch over us and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy didn’t help.
My grammar is poor.
Tom was available.
Tom's going into town.
I am interested in Japanese culture.
This is Java.
Who saw me.
Tom is approaching.
Tom is a true hero.
Where'd you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That did the job.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn’t think for a second to try to convince Mary to do so.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom sleeps soundly.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it.
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found the time to write that report.
I can do without it.
There are people out there who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's getting dressed.
He threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love walking by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
And the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Surrender the formations.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you, Tom.
This afternoon, we'll be eating cherries from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
That's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Tonight's fine with me.
They were heading east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The tiles that fell from the roof were torn apart.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom was going to throw us out.
Tom is not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up my report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You'd better go.
Tom took the exit.
I've got two cameras.
What'd you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game's not over.
Tom put down his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to have a hard time understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amoebas are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
He swims every day.
This doesn't necessarily mean Tom's dead.
Waves are created by the wind.
Get a clean glass out of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill you.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French write their word for "bubble".
The crane can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good for?
We're pretty good.
Pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love to travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You have a guilty conscience, don't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, your nose is leaking.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it would rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would have stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom forbade me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing pyjamas and a bathing suit when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're retarded.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
There is a fountain in the middle of the city.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the way.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
Mathematics is the best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
He believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
It forces us to work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and the deceased at every funeral.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom was not surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climatic conditions are not peculiar to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should I take this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy don’t write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We depend on work.
This box is made of tin.
She failed the test for a reason.
Trust your own intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's mad.
Try not to pay any attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
Sperm was pouring; there was a lot of sperm.
Tom is very annoying.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to dance too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was a one-legged man.
Is Tom interested?
I got it right here.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
This cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I am afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're skilled.
What's wrong with her?
It's not an ordinary pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They will pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not a faggot.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait for her here?
You come out naked like that, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I rigged it.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everybody busy?
They don’t want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom's been shot.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom did not resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All shops are closed.
You've been playing white again!
Stop busting your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
It's a useless drama.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom get along with his co-workers?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you a little advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still can’t believe it.
What's the abbreviation for?
Thanks again for coming.
They are deceiving us.
The wounded soldier could barely walk.
The sun has just risen.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
He often makes movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light is reflected from the water.
Tom sipped the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the objects on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Do you mind if I touch you?
Is there something missing?
Sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked among the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd side with Tom.
They couldn't have avoided them.
We're supposed to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.
Tom acted like a gentleman.
Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was watering his tub with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is no.
I'll get it for you.
He has written two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gift.
Tom was hardworking.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the slope.
Should I invent something?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's have a look.
Europeans love to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He has a lot of debt.
She knows the major capitals.
What's under the covers?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's giving everyone a drink.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously lost his mind.
Tom approached them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn’t want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her service.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
When should we start to worry?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had already sunk.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
I'm in pain at work.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was totally wrong.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a prodigy.
He's walking to school.
It’s starting to dawn on us that we can’t ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very conceited.
Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Don't make any noise.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives across the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn’t act quickly.
I'm weak.
Knit a loose sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
You'll never be admitted to that club.
Tom was not born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn’t respond immediately.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so anxious tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We exaggerate.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better as soon as he drinks a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't know anything about business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, it'll fix itself... when the willow gives birth to grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when is there fireworks?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants what you want.
I didn't betray anything.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question for which no one has found an answer, myself included, despite thirty years of research on the female soul, is “What do women want?”
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
Farmers are reaping the harvest.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the gap?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
Every time we part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
They're all up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me lucky!
The concert ended with the National Anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Hold on a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's enough air in here.
She's married to a man for nothing.
The wind is still.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything fancy.
The old man died before he died.
I don't like this book.
Fortunately, I hit it.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I caught chickenpox.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's right for me.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
Anyone who can hear the butterflies laughing knows the taste of the clouds.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not about waiting like commodities!
But if I had been in Brazil, I would have been much more afraid.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my workday.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
He looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is to our right.
Tom's not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
This guy's a thug.
Tom may have seen it.
Tom's a bit of a knocker.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How is the volume of the cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's been drinking.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the plug.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a type of mammal.
Dan beckoned Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally get it.
Tom looks shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, what about you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our job a lot easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
You took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I've seen Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral processions.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, let me know, and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's what I'm good for.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is understated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my most recent review.
I've been sick for two days.
It's a waste of guts, it's too easy to bend.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have been amazed.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Going out in the rain is not an option.
I'll tell them to leave now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an aspen.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had his doubts.
Tom hit Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of this makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
Who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can deal with her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was immediately worried.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already do.
She wrote a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom thought he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old cottage has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely made it out alive.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaking.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little dazed.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise Hawaii all year round.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and scratch her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her that I love her.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We rolled up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do whatever you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was blowing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It is better to be an optimist and a liar than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Considering what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You mustn't lose your shape.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I'm not waiting for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you angry with me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not the shy guy he used to be.
Contash?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We got a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played marbles, some tile, some with a ball. Others rode a bicycle or rode wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We should both go.
The pain caused by love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to get Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from within.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You banged your head.
We're going.
Return the seat.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom gets angry.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less humid today than it was yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's weird how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't tell which one the baby likes, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I've got to get home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom had a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false lead.
Tom was struggling.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody's singing.
Do you know how to fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handcuffed?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slit on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing all right.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail someday.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father-in-law.
Tom didn’t know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does she cost over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was suffering from pneumonia, I just sat in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard right.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a glutton.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
My mom buys me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a jerk.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you would give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the solution?
Is that necessary?
Tom is behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
Maybe you should call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts.
We were 18 years old then.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Keep up the good work.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Brace yourself.
You're magnificent.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
She looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a sweatshirt.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've been through a lot worse.
Tom struggled to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one drink.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everybody's in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What were you doing last?
We won.
He said he had never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I am going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
We're under pressure.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties very often.
He doesn’t look like his father.
Tom's not very tough.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom looked around, as if expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take your coat off.
I don't think I was followed.
They have no defense.
They often help others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You are entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We cannot forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'm gonna tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get involved.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm gonna stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine it's a party, but it's how you want it.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom buttered his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard him snorting.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on the ridge.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What is your favorite French wine?
Soon it will be Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to this sort of thing.
You'll be all right.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's tough.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the winners are always right, and the losers are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translation of jokes is quite difficult, if at all it can be said that it is possible.
It was an arraignment day.
I have bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome your weakness.
How many push-ups do you do a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
You wouldn't happen to have a key, would you?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was full of alcohol.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small joint.
I'll make sure we finish the projects on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
And if we don't find them?
Don't make me come for you, Tom.
He won first place in the competition.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
She often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed up late last night.
You're depraved.
Everybody's quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He abandoned the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
That's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that how much we need them?
He was suffering from health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earaches.
Dan was hit in the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What did Tom do?
You're in a nightmare.
It's not a good time right now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get a response from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
Now it's all over.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on Tom's mind?
A mother's advice would outweigh a friend's.
We are not out of danger yet.
Tom's freaking out.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom right away.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I finished it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom has seen worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter went deep into the forest and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom's a nice guy.
Stop screaming, my head's killing me.
You're not gonna give me orders, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get tired.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant is adored by little children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put lipstick on.
She has a picture.
He swims well.
The flowers are blooming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is really annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, urgently!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this place available?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
I certainly wouldn't want to intrude.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It'd be really nice if you kept your mouth shut.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying out of school.
I have often heard him play the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all the art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's fooling around.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check to see if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There is almost no coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human companionship.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, quite by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It’s hard to understand self-harm if you’ve never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can myrtle be used in dishes?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom got very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without anyone's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
She's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours straight.
I got quality.
Did you find anyone to look after the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom chuckled out loud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not saying anything.
That'd be good.
It's a quick walk.
Tom's very stingy.
That's what I said.
Tom's got a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.
I'm gay.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom has prepared for me.
I've seen it myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you asked me to do.
Tom looks annoyed.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where there are none.
My sister does her hair in the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Water evaporates from the rain when it is warm.
Ask him to wait till I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be in school.
I never say anything, even if it annoys me.
You're beneath him.
It's hard for me to hurt you.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to accept the job.
How much of our body is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please, help me meet Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
Why are you so dressed up?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
Books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a good point.
They must be worried.
I drove him.
It gave me an idea.
The clock has broken.
I asked about him.
Tom says she likes you, Mary.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good parking spot.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
It's his business.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a gun.
Tom closed the door.
I think the box is empty.
I'm feeling a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sledding.
You dare to sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me. Look at me.
How many gallons of oil does it collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another light.
We don't have anything you want.
This bulb is green.
Tom apologized for what he had said to Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom frowned.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just got off the phone with them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
They're all seated.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I'm not good at walking.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
All right, let's get started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
Prohibited from speaking during the test, folks.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
He said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan is walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited; everyone has their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric is very stretchy when it's washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm hiding him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom began to speak.
I skipped class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, I'll have a hard time catching fish.
Tom was asleep.
I think she's good at dancing.
The system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom looks confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom said he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and as deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a harsh critic.
I've cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I got a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear the air.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll take that.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom got away with it.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family begins where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We've been trying.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You're too busy.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is, who will tell him?
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a gardener.
I'm gonna have to try to deal with this on my own.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure these aren't diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is uneventful.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.

Have a good trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was attentive.

Plus, I can fly.
We're out of money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I wouldn't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I have never aspired to be anything other than what I am.
Sometimes it's hard to tell if Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't burn me.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Have you made a wish?
Sometimes children are afraid of the dark.
Stay away.

Here's the one I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them clapping.
Too bad I didn't ride a bike here.
I have to go see Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
It's not that much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.

I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?

He suddenly appeared.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's a used car dealer.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's overkill.
Who was the thief?
He has a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tapes doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry.
I'm mad at you.
We waited.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come back next month?

I don't want to talk about the weather.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls teased her about her clothes.
You'll get confused.
I'm not following you.

Tourists were not happy.
Tom put on his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like spider webs - they hunt flies, but they let the wasps and hornets break through.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, as was his habit.
He took off his fur coat downstairs, climbed upstairs, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see it the same way, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
There was something wrong with Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're full.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait at the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.

What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can shackle me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you.
Try this sweater.
The cat put its claws in my hand.

They were chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I wanted to visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig wells for you.
I have a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom obviously loves you very much.
You're a good cook.
There is no shortcut to the top, only to the abyss.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom gets paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Self-driving cars are now widespread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I got Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The clerk was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making scrambled eggs.
I like the color blue.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugarcoat my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play bagpipes?
They picked her up pretty good.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a gift to me that I spent the evening with a smart, witty, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of the control of her parents.
Tom's a spendthrift.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's undressed to take a bath.
A river of sweat started pouring down my face.
Mary renounced her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm studying math.
Pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you two make out?
Movies are a great distraction.
At first I didn’t see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they'll come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't quite right.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made everything a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The plug doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee and Tom likes to drink lukewarm.
I gave her a fake address.
He's out of his mind.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom chuckled.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom began to speak.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
You looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom's got a temper tantrum.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a completely new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost had a run-in with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I am getting weaker.
The cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel, too.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where did Tom go?
Who won the prize?
Please be on time.
The Germans have a softer attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, who will?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't see that coming.
Can you deliver this?
I've had no luck.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I've really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always loved mystery characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American singers.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wished he'd never come back here.
Nobody likes a crybaby.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's a real knocker.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We arrived first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been out of work for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He used to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport has expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was very helpful to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'm coming to save you.
I have a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We're fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn’t lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's the point?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I got a couple of doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wit.
We need to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is mostly poor.
None of us was right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People are dying all the time.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He drew his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked a mule.
Tom passed away a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is abhorrent.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marko thinks he's very good at writing.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
What a scoundrel you are!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn’t want to give up.
Tom was suspended.
They're getting off.
She's going to be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks busted.
Something's strange.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're stalling.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom is furious.
It's from work.
We'll figure it out.
Praise encourages students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom locked the door of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noblewomen.
He has been learning French for many years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How to choose a man only one?
I've come to feed Tom's fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone is trying to kill us.
I get paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear your child’s laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us in paradise.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins the argument.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Don’t mix work and pleasure.
I work in Boston.
He placed a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unzipped.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom was sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
She asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm bored of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw it, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was in the back seat.
The bank loaned $1 million to the company.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what is important to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, my head's killing me, I'm really hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
He moved cautiously.
Just get in there.
He forged a sword out of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told my own story.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut off his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman called the man.
Tom found something interesting.
They had more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's furious.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn’t take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It is about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood clot in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
You're overreacting!
He's got a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What flavor do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show will be cancelled; they didn’t sell a lot of tickets.
Tom's coming.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim a lot?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
It's Merak to read books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom looks like a jerk.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their faults.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do it right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd water the tub.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunder.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom kicked him to the ground.
There is no end to this teaching!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to hang out with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
What do you mean you're still not sleeping?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen him.
That would be uncultured.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a good point.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm dating my ex-boyfriend again.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head reminds me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would pay back.
She's always working hard.
Which country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
He can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn’t understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I am still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling out to John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits still.
Go with crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
The forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with destiny.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to sympathize.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise annoyed me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto any time soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom pretended to be a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I'm having sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you so.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's very good at handling saws.
Turn it off.
I do not share my real name on any website.
They dropped the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for about a week now.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a vortex.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was smeared with semen.
Tom's fair.
You have to do this first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything you said.
Tom aspires to be a teacher.
Have a great week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom has to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
They're too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would have loved this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I don't remember what the question was, though.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it's started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shayka punctured the tire.
We made trees.
This is so much better.
I'll get her to mow your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a peach.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and clamps.
You have to forgive me.
She went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It's not working yet.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you sincere?
The cup was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't back down.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came to life in the dead man's coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll get someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is compromised.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I arrived this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I don’t have enough money right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, what about you?"
Lightning struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never set foot there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom is very good at his job.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom did all of this.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is lukewarm.
Pretto, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom’s response?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I had to do.
Tom's a long way away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained to do that.
She has narrow hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Will they arrest me?
Unfortunately, it breaks all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line waiting for you.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound released pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom tossed Mary the papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
It is the translator's moral choice whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left to the language that produced them.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to get Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom looks worried.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom’s kindness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'm gonna keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
There was a huge crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked into Mary’s eyes and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Is that so?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom came home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always made sure I didn't say too much.
You're a wanderer.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's wet.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Someone may have been following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a drug in powder form.
We walked along the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom had a bad reaction.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was staring at you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a pleasure to meet her great-granddaughter.
This is our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom nodded.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak on your own behalf.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're qualified for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom looks indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's dead.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were wrong.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we were confronted with terrible news.
The knee injury is now festering.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to enjoy it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would Tom do this to us?
I don't even want to know.
They're gonna do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel burst in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy man to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She likes to run.
I need a nutmeg.
It was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom re-read the note.
The children drew pictures on the pavement with chalk.
You wonder why you've stayed so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom got married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
Playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what had happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
It swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as it took me to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's pretty common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's dealing with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned off the lipstick.
Oh, guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
The moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's morning.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down the wall!
Tom looks stunned.
Tom was stunned.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good about my retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
It gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn’t get an answer from them.
I'm not Tom's favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school in a car.
Did you watch?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing the proverbs?
It was a great series.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was on a Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in the ass.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's obviously angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We took care of it.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom was on time.
Television is boring.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say goodbye to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be tested.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
That sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
Water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's safely here.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks that fly from the hearth.
It's just made up.
She stayed up all night with Mary.
He wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's collect a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming up.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
You stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately on the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
My kids love cake.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom gets angry.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I love the horse.
I didn't touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted that he had to lie.
Mary's got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom began to whine.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom left work early.
Everything is there for us.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You were right in the beginning.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively, but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
It's over between me and Tom.
She didn’t know who Mary’s parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
I woke up screaming from a nightmare.
Tom has poor eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
- Is it done?
We all want lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom closed his eyes.
The tribe was not overjoyed that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put on an apron.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
I have already written everything that needs to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There is no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room below this one?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn’t sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What’s the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're very insolent.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or do I seem to be?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
This is a burden on him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I overeat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see a thing.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both of my brothers are musicians.
Tom is jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and pinned another to the spot.
Stop! Stop!
Would you like some cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means bright.
That was very negligent of Tom.
It's busted.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut your hair.
Cutting is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They will be well paid.
Tom probably got out.
We weren't fighting.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time you are heavy and light, pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with you or without you.
For now, let's just say you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I'd known.
Tom's spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You missed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They're all alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix the two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fuzzy.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom didn't even cry.
I wrote a book and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
There is nothing more pathetic than stupidity and indifference.
They're all being flogged.
Tom did not protest.
Where do websites come from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She is a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day shoveling snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
I get paid to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you as happy as you want to make me.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the chimney.
The dove symbolizes peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enya's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm getting sleepy.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Do not smoke excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We looked everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'm gonna get you.
Push the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom tore up his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
Bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table over there.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees fell down.
Lions don't know colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is messed up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a handful of passengers survived the crash.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom is very polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm shorter than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
He noticed that he didn’t have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why Do Cows Survive?
I've got pus in my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These guys don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
He promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
We've been cursed.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn him around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live a long time.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom sleeps very soundly.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're kind of weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggplants.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for fools.
Why would I help him?
Tom took off his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants have died.
Hang on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sucking up to his boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What good am I to you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when she wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this one.
They trusted her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't buckle.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat out.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows down the choice.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his child.
I underlined the word “Alice” to highlight it.
Third time lucky.
We should throw it.
This air dough is popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and renounce the vices.
You're smart.
I'm against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I got here too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Illnesses often occur at the most inopportune times.
This dog is staring at me like he wants to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin, and they were not real men at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
That was really sweet.
They all die sometime.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I think about it all day.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like a sail.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn’t know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds.
That's supposed to be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom backed off.
Don't repeat yourself.
Cherries are wormy.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
It's Tom's fault.
Warm it up.
Tom looked annoyed.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom was upset.
They began to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
By the way, don't drop it.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test. And you?" "Same."
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn’t seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was talkative.
How was the play?
I'm a student.
It's right there.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm gonna take Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do anything.
You are my pride and joy.
What's he gonna say?
Make two rows.
The headlines should attract the attention of readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than submit.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I watched a French film with an English translation.
She laughed at Mary.
He is full of self-confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that the child's diseases are false.
Dan had a tumultuous relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital's not that big there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not banging their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls reach puberty between the ages of 10 and 11, and boys between the ages of 11 and 12.
She's gone.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon clear.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was dressed up.
It was really cheap.
Marriage scares a lot of people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The people rebelled against the king.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day of school.
Don't get sloppy when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half of the species are females.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
It's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do socially useful work to make amends for everything I’ve done.
Tom's tied up.
Are you afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don’t understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I had to take into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Did the wasps poison themselves?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary gave a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who will pay the rent?
You're being a little disrespectful.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows etiquette.
You've seen what I can do.
We got a lot of money.
Does it fit your age?
Can I have one?
It’s not all milk and honey.
I have information on this subject.
Tom nodded.
Do you know the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had prepared a speech.
The falcons have a sharp vision.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was honking.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom laughed politely.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took the weight off.
They went for a walk.
This is his maternal grandfather's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano is active again.
Tom told me he needed to take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The small island from afar looks like a turtle.
Do they bite the trout?
What did Tom say?
Stop blanching.
I'm 30 years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long yet.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go to a movie.
Good-looking women age much better than good-looking women.
Tom has sheep.
He's the one who tripped him.
Mary felt her face warm.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom had retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom needlessly picks up the jeep.
She deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
I'm in terrible pain here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
He couldn't remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom is replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's messing with him.
Faith means hoping for that which reason cannot hope for.
Tom was my friend.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're ruining your whole life.
I couldn’t imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The Smurfs are back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They elected a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's dragging himself in the back.
We value our customers.
We have to respect the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for their salary to be raised.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I would've had lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons and land.
How about I see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
I bought those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like grease.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
Today was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father has the flu.
I'm not waiting very long.
Just look at you.
This is magnificent.
There is a gap between the two points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers shot.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
You did.
Tom came out.
That's all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom is furious.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They've disassembled it.
Tom's a big tit.
Do you mind if I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn’t believe that.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It boils like an eel.
You have to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go get Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off your mask.
It's definitely an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm bluffing.
I like the way you dance.
I need some.
We were fooled.
Tom's the one.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've disfigured him.
She's a squirrel.
Sit down. Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
The shoes are bugging me.
Tom said nothing about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was breathless.
Can you catch those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your policy is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I screwed up.
He healed me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in the city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice has melted.
I bled out.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must have been so relieved.
I've never been caught.
I love my country.
I have not learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't lecture me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They see themselves in the mirror.
It is not my place to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two are running against me!
I've never worn a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I study music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won’t be worth the wait.
I have to buy a new rug for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary's been gone since day one.
Let's hang out.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Aren't you going to eat the spinach?" "I'm going to eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took the weight off.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom was singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her waist.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom hugged Mary.
I'm gonna go look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't want to use dildos - I prefer real cocks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You're only allowed to stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's going alone.
Tom only had fives in school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.

The dentist installed a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted the local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me this map.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.

That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat an apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you been working for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom speaks French.
Tom cut my hair.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it is convenient to wipe it with an elbow, right?
Men have seven to eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you like to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us to help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're losing their minds.
He's really turning me on.
I can go wherever I want.
He was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear touches itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I doubted it.
Tom's not doing what he's supposed to be doing.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do later?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
I'll wash up first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn’t ask her to go there.
I hate him.
He became a Chukunbaba just a few days before he was ninety-nine years old.
Did you look everywhere?
It is important to remember that no one is ever 100%.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is excited.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.

Scientists say that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her often.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom cut down the tree.
The land is still under water, and the sword will probably be given up.
I was taking a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom’s last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She aspires to become an actress.
I broke my plastic bottle.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom's a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there silent.
I collect postage stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Is this where you live?
The room looks like a mess.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom fuzzy stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are good.
It doesn't matter.
I like comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I tell you?
Legumes fall from a tree.
You got a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind blows.
It's a risky plan.
What's the fastest way to get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to dress up this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door creaked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's staying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed the way Mary looked at him.
You're giving me a lot of pressure.
Ask him to explain.
It still works.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you get some rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky brightened.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.
That’s not something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing a draw.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I can get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it's done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt very strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is brittle.
Tom is the tallest man in his class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in your journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but couldn’t see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into this right now.
Why are you bending?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking too much water can cause illness.
We're about ready.
Tom's got a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
He doesn't like me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull out the plug.
I helped him clear the table.
I ate a steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is ugly.
I'm sorry I said anything at all.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom drank it.
I slept in the chute.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly how it's gonna work.
Aren't you cold in your short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese ass movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We made them cakes.
Fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He looked me in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom's acting like he's stopped.
You're having fun prolonging your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demek, should I know you?
Tom cleverly covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing nothing.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles with a variety of vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just trashed Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son really likes rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He got in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent a new fly to the table that he had just bought.
Tom's going to help Mary.
He grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's stoned.
The scenery is superb.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to contain myself.
Autumn has arrived.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes to boil the water.
I could get fired for this.
What is Intent?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of universal human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do things on his own.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, don't you see how miserable I am?
Seems familiar.
I envied her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a shrewd man.
Everything seemed all right.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
Exercising.
She may have been fooling you, but she's not fooling me!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a cobbler.
It’s just a matter of solving this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshade.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to be stung by a catfish.
We import grain from the United States.
Here’s how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
Wipers do not help against ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it's out of the question to ask Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don’t have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make his face.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom hit me with a rock.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry about Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
She didn’t even know she had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all hesitated.
I’m still thinking about her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thanks.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom still can't spell his own name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
That's not what I'm good for.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice are carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom apologized.
I'll start tomorrow.
I was not honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm sick of Tom.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused an accident.
We were hugged.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's all right.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English and I don't speak German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I've been disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The President announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom helped me out a little bit.
Am I too early?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom's tying his ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom is not listening.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom is going somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm went off.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why he was chosen.
That is an undeniable fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom frowned a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
He gave himself up to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Medell<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are a species of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom took the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the door.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't want riddles.
This book will help you to write well.
This place is in a valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, lighten up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I've been squeezing my toast with honey.
They ate the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is excited.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I made a cake.
Look at the counter.
I was impressed with your design.
You told me to call you whenever.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I love the foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefit do we have from this?
I am with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick word.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everybody has to stay.
We were totally confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt that he needed to be redeemed.
This is a message for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom held up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was there.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He hit the dog with a rock.
Tom was staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek wrote this book himself!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be conceited.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to irrigate it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
That's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know it was happening.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly over you.
I'm in.
Tom admitted he spilled the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush is committed to human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little further.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just grab my arm.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a while.
How Many Stomachs Should I Do Daily?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You have a lot of piercing eyes.
Isn't that implied?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom into town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I write pretty well.
Will you get back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let him in, then come in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems more confident.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not accurate.
They will probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four corners.
I continued to work.
They develop dependency.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and remained silent.
Get the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary turned to her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finished the mission.
Tom wiped the knife blade off his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just have her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the counter.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
Give me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how this is possible.
He looked at me through his glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Is Tom hurt?
Who can break an aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression at several points in his life.
Can I grab your bags?
I would trust it with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is wild.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a tow truck.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk face-to-face.
Tom is not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the exam results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was chewing on something.
She's studying English.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
He opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit out the chewing gum.
Make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended it?
How'd you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to acquire bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won’t pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked very strong.
What to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I won't say it again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's got a stiff neck.
Grab the day.
What's Tom calling?
He's very handsome.
Beware of the buyer.
Tom often runs away from classes.
Now it's time for a refund.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can come out at the end.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll figure it out.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary was wearing false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to do something like this.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture, the speaker was supposed to speak slower.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
This medication calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look foolish.
His mother is American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It's moldy bread, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked annoyed.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working fine.
Tom got very sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just freaked out.
I'd rather have goat cheese than cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven’t eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zine all the way.
Same-sex couples should not be allowed to marry.
The cow has forgotten that it was once a calf.
Give them the picture.
He was buried alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
Still no sign of Tom.
That's when I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
Stolov is plastic.
Sunlight is the best means of disinfection.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They got serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary did.
That was very helpful.
He lifted me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
Brought in after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
There's a red light on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circulates through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
It always smells like mayonnaise.
It won't help the lies.
I have a pain in my right leg.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from? Where are we going?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's baking for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom get here?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yes, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one will bother you.
Tom didn't really think about that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just messing with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a daunting task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
Camoli if he were here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
He often called Mary.
Thank you, darling.

This is a leather belt.
Tom caught a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we can beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where'd you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back before the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You shouldn't be here for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't feel bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I ran out of walls.
The clock is broken.
Tom's got to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom rolled the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood among the ruins.
Tom is a materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Hand me the pliers.

This is a little loose around the waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom ate the bean.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom had a good day today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When is the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he planned to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you cooking?
This is your house now.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I want to do.
It's not my call.
Despite our expectations, no charges were made.
Lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I always wanted to be a teacher.

Tom had an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I often ski.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When will my turn come?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I was barely able to escape being caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom came back soon.
I'd be in favor.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the boat when it exploded.
Who's going to pay for the zion?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You tricked me.
For Greta, that is.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're bugging her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You look like you have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red at dusk.
I came to wish you luck.
I'd be delighted if you'd come too.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I don't speak English very well.
We'll deal with it.
Bread is made from flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
Would you like a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot in here in hell.
I overlooked that.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
It's cold here.
To congratulate you on your wedding.
Kids, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
That's great!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.

I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's ridiculous.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why won't anyone help us?
The hole is tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy that?
I had a great time last night.
Tom was in the hut.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll kick you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's starting to get dark.

I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a butcher.
I have faith in myself.

Tom looks horrified.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's it.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're disorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you complete the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're uncultured.
Do you play sports?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.

Word of honor.
We have three guards working in shifts.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you describe it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took this picture.
Tom closed his mouth.
Don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not a bad guy.
He never hired them.
I like cakes.
We did nothing for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.

That was so sweet.
I'm going to hide.

Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole other story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn’t sleep well.
I'm going to end it.
I'm gonna go change.
Put the phone down.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find me a head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, I'm gonna lose my movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
It could never, ever, ever happen here.

Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, there's no rush.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was raining two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked an apple pie.
The sound of the horse’s hooves calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the whole topic.
I think this is over.

I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Do you cook for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm sure.
We're gonna have to get Tom's permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need to see.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I take a shower?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much as I do.

We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.

I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
He visits Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?

The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?

It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She wanted to be a nurse.
Tom has obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
He spent the night drinking in a local pub.
I'm in.
Do you need a grater?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to make it up to you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is definitely a joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.

I'd be happier if you three got back out there.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom practices the violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still angry with Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?

At your service.

Do we really need this much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more stuff I have, the more I'm gonna have to clean up.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to apply sunscreen.
Was that hard for you?
Tom’s voice was barely audible.
Don't shut up.
I decided to forgive him.
How long does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's waiting.
I'm trying to make you bend over.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowly descended.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew immediately that something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures have no meaning to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?

That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.

No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.

We're scrambling.
That's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to rejoice or not.

This house is better than the other.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see him.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost there.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one gets fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.

Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to rule.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call for help?
Tom rinsed his mouth.
It smells like cheese.
Tom's not delusional.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?

Tom looks offended.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
He held a drink in his hand.
What a pair they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.

It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I assume you found it.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's very talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.

Why would that scare you?
This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
He listened immediately.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without hardships.
You've got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
Don't call me an asshole.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.

Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth out with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so he wouldn't get caught.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom is not back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?

You can't prove anything.

Aren't you panicking?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's smart.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
That's good news, though, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of punctuation marks is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.

That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to remember where you put your passport.
That's really great.

This house is made of bricks.
We have not reached any conclusion.
Tom came in around 2:30.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat flush.
The crowd clapped.
I let the clovers grow on the edges.
I think Tom's evil.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We've been stung.
I was too tired to continue.
Everything has its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call last night from a man named Tom Jackson.

Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search on the Internet.
When I was younger, I always hitchhiked.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
You're so negative.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait for them here?

You won it.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
That will teach them.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.

We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.

There's no theoretical way I'm going to get the job done in a day.
He was almost petrified with horror.
I suddenly felt old.
They're pissing me off.
He spent the night.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge your late father.
Tom took the cake.
I have been learning French since I was 13 years old.
Men are not so different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite oils for cleansing the face and nourishing the skin.
It's all over my head in French.

Will you be open tonight?

Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're pretty.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
You got a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Don't you want to start picking your hair off of that?
How are you going to escape?
Let’s start with the wine.
My leg is broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
This is exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
It's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary loves fashion and makeup.

I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.

It's happening.
The noise will wake the baby up.
I was late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.

Nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm not usually at work on Mondays.
I was a fool to believe them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
I'd be broken.

Who gave them so much money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dishwasher work?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, the soup's too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Do you mind if I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's all this about?
You'll have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Oh, boy!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than grant your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom took two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like best.

We all want to see the movie.
I will be in Scotland tomorrow.
We broke up the conversation.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
You can’t focus on your academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became dependent.
I just want money.
I don't say mean things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I have fully recovered.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, I get blamed.

What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't pick and choose.
Is there sugar?

She suddenly fainted.
You looked funny.

Tom was sent to a mental hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
Tom said that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna be busy.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked out.
He enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I paint with or without a flash?
He and his sisters were eating ice cream while the radio was on.
Give 'em a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We do not sell alcoholic beverages or cigarettes to minors.
I got back on the bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The struggle seems to be coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's a mess.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and done.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put the collage in the top drawer.
You've been in an accident, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin the party.

I'll go if Tom goes.
We'll be back in a month.

I'll manage.
The medicine worked.
Tom can play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you somewhere I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, you lazy bastard!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's so tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?

I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really loves us.
It's very rare.

You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.

Wipe it off.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Tom is listening.
Can anybody hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a leash.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital recovering from an overdose.
He cracked the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were about to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a big shot.
When you go out with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is untrustworthy.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup up.
That's good training.
This capital is peculiar.
I should have refused.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I have lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my loved ones.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should feel sorry for them.
I don't bargain.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's quite a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a brief silence.
He closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom is exaggerating.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree with the plan.
Justice is expressed through actions.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America, you're expected to tip the waiter.
This behavior was childish on his part.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Go while you still can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable around Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the carriages.

He can't do that.
Why should I care about them?
I called him from the hospital.

Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner in the square.
Hasn't anyone informed you that you don't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell out of a tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is so much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna wander off.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got stung by something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you to be with me.
I like to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get any sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
It was a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're burdened enough with worries.
I don't think Tom's gonna be much help.
Tom looks worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom came closer.
Tom was shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is compassionate.
Keep it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've handled it.
This isn't anybody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than it was yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, football field and billiard table.
He says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was pestering his sister.
We should have given up earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do anything."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You may come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't bend over.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I'm not gonna slack off.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I believe them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genders in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to pass them on.
The noise disturbed the whole town.
A person who loves flowers cannot be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom was knocking.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears offensive clothing.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
The girls don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom may not be right.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to draw any conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm raising cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom take part?
The thief disguised himself as a police officer.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom doesn't see you anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the building, and when I drove past it, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
She was sedated.
This has nothing to do with the topic.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply moved by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes snapped.
The geyser ejects a jet of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom continued to pack.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get ahold of him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'm gonna take Tom's place.
What made you come to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've had enough of the hens.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take my picture.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I learned, French was the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
He looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is wonderful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express the idea in concrete terms.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don’t drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
This woman is easily embarrassed.
Is it possible to get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom's got plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I've lost something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
He was always poor.
It's a beautiful alcove.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom yelled at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make webs.
You really talk a lot.
It might be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
You don’t always have to believe what the other person says.
He is in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're deranged!
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I’m going to do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think it helped a lot.
Must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
The sound soon stopped.
Who did your hair?
I don't quite understand it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom getting in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't bother.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It's been a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
I think I might sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom likes to swim.
I'm gonna scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to keep it?
You're such a man-hater.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who is responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you think of contacting them?
There's nothing we can do.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated any differently than before.
You should be okay.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven’t seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who is laughing, but not who is crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was amused by listening to music.
Try on a shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did you say Tom was gonna start his party?
It was a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would be happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a very good job.
My feet still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a man who sits over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I am open to everything.
I used to hear you.
Stop where they are.
Are you a cheater?
"She loves music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut it out.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The nurse gave her a flu shot.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the pieces were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Everybody was laughing.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It’s nice to feel like you need someone.
You'll never know.
I’m still thinking about him.
I thought it was coming at me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
Nothing is more like a drunkard than a madman.
Take Tom.
Tom began to take off his clothes.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Share the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medication will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their arrogance.
Dan didn't miss a single episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom was having a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're canvassing the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
That's where we'll be.
Why are they doing this?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a lousy degree.
This is priceless.
Do you like to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, all that was left was ashes.
Tom likes all kinds of vegetables except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll drive Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make amends.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their company.
Those who confuse the verb endings "-<0xD1><0x8F>" and "-<0xD1><0x8F><0xD1><0x8F>" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened afterwards?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I wasn't counting on it.
I was careless.
Just last week, I saw Tom.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom's got two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I've decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for the whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really gross.
Would you like some cheese?
They say that eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is chaste and pious.
I'll tell Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we'll join in.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom keeps his car well.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All humans on earth are descended from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I've come to bring him a gift.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish as to think that the entire population of Georgia, who speak a Caucasian language that has neither common phonemes nor common letters with English, can completely master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There's too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
He is very good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom laughed at him.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Each student has their own closet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I have something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit tight.
Tom picked up his flute and began to play.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him in the mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I love to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned his lesson the hard way.
You showed them the forgery of my friends.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too short.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm full.
She was eating kale salad.
I'm going to run.
Tom's chewing something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
He has never been to Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's quite popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and have a look.
Do you think you're attractive?
Innocence is a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's pulse is racing.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept babbling about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, brave, and I still don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
I believe in Mary.
Busy besh.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom is watching TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
It's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I've become uncomfortable with heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold out much longer.
The virtues are a reward in themselves.
This whole thing makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We should advertise on TV.
Tom nodded inaudibly.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right for me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated me.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
She seems very sleepy.
Yesterday, I made mushroom biscuits.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in the science.
Although the earthworm has both a male and female reproductive system, it needs another individual to fertilize.
The failure shamed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom fainted.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm on my way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is estimated that the temperature on the surface of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd has gone wild.
Tom started to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is freshly baked.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to examine him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
You know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom was not impressed.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We arrived just in time.
Somehow I felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
A gentleman would never do such a thing.
I love 'em.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't play Tosho for me.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately, the hollow is stable, otherwise the storm would have completely collapsed last night.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got it all written down somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who are you working for these days?
I'm giving up.
Mary’s eyes were filled with joy.
It's bad to swear.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's being mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The dealer cheated him.
Everything is in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking of you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom went to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's simple.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to speak to her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
Everything seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did he really do it, Tom?
I didn’t even know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not good for sports.
I'm amazed, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Show me your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very alone.
I love trying new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He's done wonders.
The glands secrete chemical substances in the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
Somehow I felt sorry for her.
He's being overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why Do Rabbits Have Big Ears?
Get over here!
You could have said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It's gonna happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy in here, get me out before I suffocate.
It's gonna happen, what's gonna happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police didn't find anything to tie Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was very polite.
Guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay as long as you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "Truth or Dare."
His conclusions were based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to read the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom likes flowers very much.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I passed out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How much time do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife is getting tired of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amoebas are unicellular organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday it was hot, but today it is more durable.
I'm cold.
He walked in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not fair to me.
Someone may have been following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a piggy bank.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to talk to him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He's just gone.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You hit me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed all right.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be very useful for mankind.
I was helping them.
Have you decided yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom's got mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's good-natured.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Would you like some sparkling water?
Tom winked at the girls.
We had a hell of a time.
Today, Tom is different.
Throw them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I could not refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in the monasteries.
Don't be such a pervert!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your pay.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
It's bothering me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics and chemistry.
Tom's a money launderer.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
I thought you said you could swim.
Don't put pressure on Tom.
I've been betrayed.
And the paper's gone.
Tom can't express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb's flint, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom was fooling you.
I wouldn’t go in that direction.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not exactly an option.
How old were you when your parents got divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke rises in the air.
The printer's not working.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's feeling much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We drink water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the match.
Tom doesn't like a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm an only child.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have great resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should understand oils and engine lubricants.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're sick of it, aren't you?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I took out my knife.
They're dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom was calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I have to go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much of an appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
He quickly got lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a baker.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the issue we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you blink when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'm gonna give him one more chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I totally misjudged her.
It'll be over soon enough.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my dad?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's snoring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can get him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the seven.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I've come for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You guys were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm went off.
The bird lifted the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man he was three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to make time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to free himself.
What do they want me for?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not a good time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is his best feature.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's really strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I have a guilty conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's been drinking tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're talking too much.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's getting hurt.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I'm paying my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I will pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom was out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to my face.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to wash up.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom had done that.
If I ignore him, he's gone.
They'd just be bothering Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
Everyone was on alert.
He's a little hard of hearing, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
For now, for you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in the place of their choice.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing a one-piece shirt.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm kidding.
He took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's papers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six cups of coffee a day.
Tom nodded loudly.
It was Better.
Tom started snorting.
I'm gonna have to ask you to stay a little longer.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed to her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was mad.
The can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why were you pretending to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom held out his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the flag of lead?
Cheer up!
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I think I found one.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been without food all week.
I don't understand you.
Even though I'm a pious man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so mad.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing the same thing Mary is doing.
There's something we need to investigate.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That’s actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your chest?
He drank in silence.
I've been shot!
Who said anything?
Tom began to say something, but Mary silenced him.
We met at the Meena.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I've turned the whole town around looking for a home.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug should be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got it wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house is cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't grumble.
Tom woke up.
Tom angered Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I've come for him.
Come on, now.
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He loved Boston so much.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for it yet.
Each member must be present.
She didn’t understand his joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
Doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me get a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not delinquents.
Flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom did not agree with Mary on the subject.
You're righteous.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You cut your collarbone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
That's where I was with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was impertinent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I wanted to cook something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom crying.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn’t waste my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser.
Tom's definitely crazy.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
There's no need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We are sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look terrified.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave the house with my slippers on.
I think Tom's a schmuck.
Diseases from a terrible infection and the ovary and flow.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't come into consideration.
Tom headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
Sometimes he behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
This is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make a blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
Navaka.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come have a drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
He said he didn’t know how to play tennis.
Where did you find it, live?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We mustn't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we ditched.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you banging on it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in the room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
Your ankle's been clipped.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I've been a little busy.
He decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
Neither here nor there.
Phone books are fascinating.
You don’t have to be defensive.
This is the best pizza in town.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
