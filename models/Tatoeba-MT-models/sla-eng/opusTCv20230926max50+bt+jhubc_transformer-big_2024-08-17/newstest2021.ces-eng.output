Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, <0xC5><0xA0>koda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 on the Kayserispor field and retained the third Besiktas.
Attacker Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda gave after the January transfer from Slavia already the tenth goal for Rizespor, who was saved, although he died 1:3 on the field Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goaltender of Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech football player from an angle threw the ball into the net.
The hosts managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the set-up took the victory to his side, having successfully completed the four-on-one break.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda in the opening of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo 1:1.
Although Rizespor did not hold the indecisive state for long, but it did not have to be sad, because thanks to the results of the opponents, he remained three points above the downhill zone.
The competition will end with the Sunday duel of Master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa field.
The well-kept Cave at the hermit in the forests near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in the <0xC4><0x8C>eskolip region, in the forests through which the Hrab<0xC4><0x9B>c<0xC3><0xAD> cesta led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and man-made.
And we will go after the human hand made.
The place is called the Hermit's Cave.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely, a shelter chamber, apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rock shelter and accessible by stairs from above.
However, until the last moment it is practically not visible.
It is revealed only by a narrow staircase leading to a rock gallery, from where you just enter the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is quite far from human habitation, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau, where today there is a forest.
"The fact that the object does not have a window, and even in the traditional location of the heating place, clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used to store containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
On the walls of the cave there are traces of tools.
Breaking sandstone with a tip was quite simple and quick for the initiates.
It was enough to properly use the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail and the method of cutting, the period of the cave formation can be determined.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are intrigued by the flowing stream and the nearby Count's path under the cave, you will surely find the path down as well.
And on the way from the forest you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jokoj Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is now in the best of hands.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, moreover, we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me, as well as taking care of my daughter Finja," Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k's wife Katja told news server Jezdci.cz.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in making predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," the 45-year-old jockey's wife said.
To financially support the injured Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, also called on Twitter, equalizing the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been raised on the Gofundme server.
The target is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 (CZK 2.6 million).
Video referee took the football players Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola's players in Saturday's match in Naples got four times the ball into the opponent's goal, but in the end they had to reconcile with the defeat 0:2.
Neither of their goals was recognized by the referee after consulting with the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never ruined the VAR of one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no other team.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport said in a statement.
"The Sassuola Unrecognised Goals Festival.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team," Corriere dello Sport added.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play, it seemed that Sassuolo had evened out.
The goal of Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>, however, was not recognized after the intervention of the video referee due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s other interventions and hits by Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not pay off.
On the other hand, the home team added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they charged the most in history
"The growth was driven by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Chmel<0xC3><0xAD>k, head of CEZ's Clean Technology Division.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of Tesla electric cars, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are reporting their share of the market.
The operators of conventional filling stations are represented by MOL.
It does not yet have numbers.
"We only started building our electromobility network last year," explained Jana Jusková, a spokeswoman for the company.
However, the editorial board of the daily exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by the CEZ company.
According to them, the drivers of the stations took an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the range of about one hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we skip the small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists were already paying for the collection, their typical spending was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague there are all five most used chargers of the company CEZ, which its popularity overshadows the entire regional cities.
Olomouc then leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the borderlands, for example in Bohum<0xC3><0xAD>n or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of the year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll in the daily <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Czechs on the Move“, eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for a family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s actions so far in the protection and healing of the Czech landscape and the solution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event entitled The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have, for example, people who have long been opposed to the expansion at the Tur<0xC3><0xB3>w mine, there are people who are opposed to the mining of the gravel pit near Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostroh, there are people who are opposed to the construction of senseless dams," Marika Volfová said for the organizers.
The main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a sharp change in agricultural policy and the system of subsidies towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> there was a stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to make efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of the rapeseed depot" or "Less coal, more boats".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda from the association For Water for People came from South Moravia to Prague to protest against the plan of mining gravel pits in the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to reports, it is certain that the quality of the water will be endangered.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in the Karlovy Vary region for the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He drew attention to the virtues of small farms that do not marry for income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, and they will not do such a destruction in the form of rural areas and the environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash in Germany
An ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in West Germany, killing three people and injuring two others.
It was reported by local rescue services, according to which among the dead are probably two members of the crew and one resident of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, was subsequently caught in a fire.
Firefighters have managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy fire chief Robert Meyboom said the two crew members were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The daily Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to the mayor of Wesel, wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
Near the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police believe it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The plane took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane had disintegrated in the air before impacting the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech Savings Bank mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, <0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna mistakenly charged some card payments to its clients twice.
According to bank spokesman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kropik, the problem may have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were recorded by the Savings Bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Just yesterday (Saturday) night, we made an update to the system and immediately returned all these double payments to the clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems," Kropik said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice is not known by the bank’s spokesman, according to his estimate, there were fewer than thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated by the Savings Bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropik said.
<0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch will present the system of three emergency stages against coronavirus on Monday
"Gradually, they will be according to the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch told Czech Television.
It will be a so-called semaphore, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk with epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that at present only the Moravian-Silesian Region would be orange and Prague would approach it.
Individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers will also appear on the map.
"We want to address this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
Vodn<0xC3><0xAD>k and Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller’s daughter Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka get into each other, it is not at all easy.
Jonah is prevented in love by his father, the clumsy waterman Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka, from that waterfowl villain.
What if he's intrigued and lying?
Especially if he can get Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka Joná<0xC5><0xA1> to reject and prefer him, the brave Libor.
Soon everyone in the village realizes who is responsible for the drowning of the midnight kettle, the spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other mischief.
The enraged villagers set out to hunt down the waterman, and an implacable waterman's curse falls on Jonah's head.
And now, Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ek's darling Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and rescue him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of the Czech Television and in the exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obd<0xC4><0x9B>nice in the Sedl<0xC4><0x8D>any region and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.
Mosteck<0xC3><0xBD> autodrom launches a new e-shop
Customers of the Most Autodrome can use the new e-shop on its website.
It will also purchase coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible in person with a racetrack worker in the starting tower.
“We have started to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly, and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 on all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found on the website www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodová, sales and marketing director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the website of the e-shop is now clear, the customer can easily navigate it.

The majority of people with the disease have a mild illness, and only 3% of those infected need to go to the hospital.
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavirus, or the summer dose of sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection wards are half-empty, even as numbers rise.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out the sampling, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people were dying every day.
Now, daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day, a maximum of two people die from COVID-19.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected people per capita, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by the hygiene department in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We are walking, we have restricted movement, we have all hygiene measures," said Martin Schánel, the director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home has symptoms of the disease so far.
The surface testing will begin with hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will detect whether people have a mask on when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the prachatice company.
Overall, 131 more people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but fewer are being tested at the weekend.
The debutante champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson was swept away
The big surprise of the tournament called Dimitri van den Bergh showed excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious event within the PDC in 2018.
The opening of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came in 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took a 13-bar break and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Cattle" could hardly get to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Maker" had him in the palm of his hand is also evidenced by the fact that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian mastered great high-profile checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavorable state, he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson showed a lot of frustration.
He merely threw the darts, and his triumphant opponent acted with complete sovereignty.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of the three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The trophy, named after Phil Taylor, is all the more valuable to the Belgian archer as he is his first major to win.
The last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, charged with the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Investigators were investigating the arson because the fire had spread through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police did not find any signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at a local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating criminal proceedings.
The prosecutor’s office said that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed, and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and decided to fully cooperate with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present a "semaphor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is meant to act as a pandemic plan, for which the government and the health ministry face criticism.
"The degrees will be according to the power of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be taken on individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Party TV programme, according to which people should have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized cases remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with talking about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
The government, taking into account the growing number of infected people across the Czech Republic, has once again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s action, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures would apply and when they would be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, settle the confusion," Senator Marek Hilsher said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague, from Sunday, the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential medical institutions, for example, in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> regions since Friday.
In the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutnohorsk Region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which color-codes the risk of infection in individual European countries and, accordingly, also regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and middle-risk countries, authorities do not require Czech citizens to have a negative coronavirus test or quarantine in its place from June 15.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues.
He's playing at one-third capacity, he should have finished at noon.
Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening estimates of the police, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková said.
Originally, techno parties were supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems had really quieted down.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still ongoing.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Nováková said.
“Police officers continue to monitor departing visitors consistently to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are supervising the event, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on the scene, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on the alert.
"During the day, police checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of them sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novakova said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the technoparty participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants were not reduced, the police would intervene.
This was stated by Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on the Prima Party TV programme.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, and neither did the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health request it.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that techno parties had spread to surrounding land whose owners disagreed with the use of techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
Fans of techno on the meadow near Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
Police initially patrolled a meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im in the Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko region on Friday, where the technoparty was held last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s Lhota, where the technicians actually got together.
According to Novak, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im.
Bite of a snake: the little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case of this year was recorded in <0xC5><0xBD>eleznorudsk.
A girl was bitten by a snake in her leg in 2010, which her parents brought to the local rescue service base," regional health service spokesman Maria Svobodová told Den<0xC3><0xAD>k, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
Snake is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
There is no danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake will bite you is not very high, in normal contact it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on them.
Its bite is not a tragedy, though its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can happen only if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is primarily in children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels sick after a bite, sweats, has fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergic people, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová of Klatovy Hospital told Dn<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
After the policeman poured wine and threw dishes
After 23:00, an intervention unit broke into the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into care by medical staff, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovska said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
Several times during the negotiations, he increased his threats by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed the windowsill himself, where he staggered.
Police are still investigating the man.
He has not yet released further information.
Stosur prefers daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be affected by the coronavirus season this year.
The 36-year-old U.S. Open champion, who became a mother in June, has yet to finish her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
“I’m going to stay home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones that our Evie is going to have in the next six months and just enjoy it,” the former world number one doubles champion said in a statement.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on 3 August with an clay court tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the complex transported 1,320 quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover, in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the recovery plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish stand, it was then found that the seller does not have proof of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last fall, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store in the area, which contained almost half a ton of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
For most, it was impossible to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had a past shelf life and was spoiled.
For five kilograms of squid, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin spoke with Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in the Donbass, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to start from midnight.
According to the Kremlin, Putin, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The cease-fire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and universal" and is to pave the way for the implementation of other provisions of the peace agreements.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the upcoming elections to local councils will not take place in the territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the border of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia, after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
Zelenskiy's office said the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in the Donbass and the need to implement further measures to support peace in the region, such as de-mining areas of fighting or withdrawing some troops from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea, and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreements helped to stop the fighting, but sporadic gunfire and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made the end of the war in the Donbas a priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the heptathlon was dominated by Novotná
Defender of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al did not run at the end of the Saturday program four hundred, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> on Sunday did not jump the base in the pole.
The ten-man team has long been dominated by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the disc he resigned.
Rykl has had two bronze medals so far from the outdoor M<0xC4><0x8C>R, this time he was the only ten-man who got over the seven-thousandth limit.
Other medals were won by Vilém Strásk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> S<0xC3><0xBD>kora after the competition.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't set up because the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I had a facial for 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and most of all I was disappointed about the disc, I was below average there," he said on Facebook.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than a hundred points, even though she suffered from an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not throw a spear 40 meters and did not enter the final eight-seater.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Organic LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to gasoline or diesel, given a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But this is quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio-LPG, which will be distributed to our gas stations in combination with the classic fossil LPG," said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Karl<0xC3><0xAD>k from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists are now refueling in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
"The only difference from the classic LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the operation of a bio-LPG car is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of the carbon footprint than the operation of an oil LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG is currently the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association’s estimates, there are about 170,000 LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number, about 200,000, in the NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of cars to LPG were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for YES) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers of coronavirus cases.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number dropped from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479 cases, down 1,775 cases.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the surge in the number of cured patients is a revision of the data, which has not been updated recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
As of Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile constituencies or correspondence option.
A political scientist and sociologist were looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
In order for people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the October regional and Senate elections, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), a change in the law is needed.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He said this on Sunday in the Party of Television Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions at the ministry with representatives of parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the current legal rules.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to their health condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on OVM that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the Chamber, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) about the correspondence election to be overstated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma said that now it is necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
He believes that the main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence selection (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
Others see the already mentioned constituencies or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavirus - were solved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pigs’ ears were thrown at the government building
Demonstrators against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the “mafia-style rule” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide lockdown on Wednesday, the DPA said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
As of 8 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators played a stage in front of the government building, during which they symbolically imprisoned Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadzhigenov, said in a public radio broadcast on Wednesday that a "peak of escalation" was coming on Wednesday in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the announcement of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to carry Bulgaria through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not appease the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government stopped a vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Sinisa Mihajlovic has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing here is not football.
I'm sick of games without spectators.
It’s sexless football, it doesn’t bring me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
It’s terrible to play like this and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks that,” Mihajlovic said ahead of today’s match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in the heat.
In such conditions, it is not even known how the teams are doing.
Just to get this season over with.
Those measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September,” said the coach, who also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he was absent from the bench for four months for the treatment of leukemia.
“Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, we managed to move our team up to the next level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of a cyber-attack by foreign countries, Iran claims
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses have reported fires and explosions.
Some Iranian officials said the fire, which broke out this month at an underground nuclear plant in Natanz, could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure faces “thousands of cyberattacks” every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them can be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several broader cyberattacks have been reported, with “certain governments and groups” behind them, according to the analysis.
He did not provide further details on the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mr Mousavi said fires in forests, refineries and other areas were common in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed the possibility that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind the recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militias, Abu Mahdi Muhandis, on Jan. 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at US bases in Iraq.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA extends production shutdown until May 25
Toyota Peugeot Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended the production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are scheduled to restart on Monday morning, May 25.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said a spokesman for the automaker Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek.
The production costs due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown are closed borders and closed dealerships, so no one has to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, that is, for two shifts.
The company’s key markets, such as Italy, the UK or Spain, are affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA is not a sign of life in the city.
“At first I knew it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it has become much more relaxed.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"We haven't had to solve almost any problems in the last two months," Kaspar said.
For example, the Mladá Boleslav-based <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants operate at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after production was resumed.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in the Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n region.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: left a message to the family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling insidious cancer, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease resurfaced.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, ended up in bed in a hospice, where she was still able to take her love of life.
Unfortunately, the disease has subsided.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, originally from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled around the world in competitions.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived a healthy life, but was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began a grueling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma managed to win over the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour spinal operation and then began again with drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, her doctors told her she had only a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
“If this was published, it means I finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can’t thank enough Ricky, who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all of my followers on the social network,” she wrote, adding that “everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.”
Slots for art sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the passer-by will get a pocket work of mostly novice Czech artists.
Images and other creations are created directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit into a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ová, curator of the project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised at what kind of work of art he gets.
Currently, he can become a new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC3><0xB3>plová or mini-views by Teresa Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutkova prepared a pexeso connected with a walk in Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell a pocket package of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a fortune-teller and a fortune-telling card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritistky.
Healthcare salaries will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger increase, according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, is unrealistic
Salaries in health care could increase by up to five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for YES) said in Questions by Václav Moravce on Czech Television.
The union’s demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (of salaries) can be anywhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March, she intervened in the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government decree against its spread.
At that time, the insurance company’s revenues were down.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS), the average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute in-patient care are likely to reach CZK 88,312, nurses CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS data also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019, according to the Czech Statistical Office, was CZK 34,125.
In June, trade union representatives said they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
In the long term, they criticize the significant difference between doctors’ and nurses’ salaries in state hospitals, which must be governed by salary tables, and contract wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private ones.
Therefore, they also require that the salary tables be uniform for health workers.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
Last year, for example, doctors’ salaries grew faster than salaries.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, trade unionists should perceive how they are currently standing.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion this year due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to be spent on the remuneration of healthcare workers in hospitals and social services.
According to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with the general salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical institutions themselves, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration currently does not have any protective medical equipment.
He is waiting for the tenders to be completed.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to supply goods better than in March when they were bought.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
A shaky smart quarantine could be taken over by the troops.
We are ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, it's something to improve of course.
We'll discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not manage it all again," the prime minister said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygiene stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of functioning.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Czech News Agency that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The crumbling project was criticised by Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
He also said that the army could take him back.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Dzurilla, the government’s commissioner for IT and digitalization, who is in charge of the project, also admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For twenty years it has been created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not a jet.
The people on the march, the poor in hygiene on the march, are adapting these new systems and picking up the mistakes,” he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won’t run again because he doesn’t want to “get lost in politics”
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the attempt to "don't fool around in politics," he told server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Presidium of the ANO movement, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, his ANO candidate in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I could hold out for one term, and with that business experience, I can turn everything around and get back on my feet," he told Respect.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for a second term.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don’t want to fool around with this policy,” added Macura, who described himself as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation about Macur’s possible end in the YES movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example, for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman’s opponent Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Draho<0xC5><0xA1> in the election.
From the YES movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is faking it, I have no immediate motive to end it," Respektu said.
Macura, 65, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark, among other things.
He also served on the boards of other companies.
Uber to return to Brno to offer transport services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, the city councilor for transport, Petr Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l (ODS), said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as the designation as a taxi or taximeter.
However, since July, the conditions for operating conventional taxis and alternative taxis have changed.
Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"Based on them, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is a consequence of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate.
The city was informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but last year Mayor Markéta Va<0xC5><0x88>ková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return on the basis of an amendment to the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too luxuriant celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of the apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a pedestrian followed him and immediately called the officers.
Upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the guard noticed an open window, under which the chair was still lying, and beside it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The movement coming from the room on the fourth floor suggested that there was a rather noisy celebration going on inside.
Officers walked down the hall to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation,” police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said in a statement.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to discuss request for Rafaj’s appeal
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats a request for the dismissal of the head of the Antimonopoly Office (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS) Petr Rafaj.
The appeal of Rafaj was called by non-profit organizations at the meetings of the anti-corruption council of the government and also the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region.
The Social Democrats say an exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to the Czech Press Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and he cannot be appointed for a third time under the law.
His dismissal falls within the competence of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafaj’s recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying he would review the materials and that government parties would take "some sort of position" on the matter.
He also said that he had not yet met with the president, and that he would not meet with him in the near future.
According to the OOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
The servers of IHNED.cz and Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafaj’s meetings with Governor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the controversial new hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek strongly advocates.
Cunek admitted the meeting, according to him, they jointly dealt with his "senior activities".
The same goes for Rafa.
The <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region's parliament called on the government to recall Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision-making of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding public procurement according to the Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Kom<0xC3><0xAD>nek is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
In March last year, police intervened at the anti-monopoly office for a toll tender.
This June, Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written for the company of the influential backstage player of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Alexander <0xC4><0x8C>uba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
Rafaj has been the President of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and the President appointed the former Social Democrat for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the president can dismiss the president of the office on the proposal of the government.
He or she may be dismissed only if he or she has not held office for more than six months or seriously impairs the dignity of his or her office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the library in Blansko, the employees collapsed with heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new equipment will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the center of Blansko on a regular basis.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
There was terrible heat and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That is why I like air conditioning," said one of the readers of Blansko, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Dlapy Library, temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it functions as a greenhouse.
"The sun, moreover, rests on it much of the day because of the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because over night the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have from morning in the library to thirty degrees," said Dlapa.
The worst of it was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And then the exhibition room and the principal's office one floor up.
An unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians have collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was impossible to breathe there, "said Dlapa.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three out of five circuits.
“Because of the limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are one floor higher," said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Svoboda from the Investment Department in Blansko.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed air-conditioning and electrical installations in the mentioned areas last autumn.
For about 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's resistance has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not all infected athletes come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are silent about the health of players like a grave and do not publish anything at all.
He was one of the few to leave the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was present only at the first training session, since then he has been absent from the squad.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for COVID-19 and have therefore spent the last two weeks locked up in my home," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about their health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into the full load.
"It's wonderful to be back.
I will do my best to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal line is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will face St. Louis in a pre-season game before facing Edmonton.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been going on regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for weeks.
The protesters are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the Emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel’s first prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He rejects all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process can take up to three years, more than 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in Israel, which has a population of about nine million, in almost 60,500 people.
455 people have died from the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases in infections.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, especially at the end of June, the number of infected began to grow significantly again.
Netanyahu’s critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, entrepreneurs affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed his car into a tree and died.
The body had to be removed from the wreckage by firefighters.
The tragic accident happened around 23 o'clock near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapy dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
Firefighters had to free the body from the wreck, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man was not driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
An end to wasting and throwing away one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
It cancels the discounts and no longer wants to throw one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dress, has changed quite rapidly in recent years.
About half of the goods were sold by Pietro Filipi at full price.
The other half, which was sold due to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to flaunt one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the times of new and old collections and blind following of fast changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most traders count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it is a bit of a fraud," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, the company wants to support local businesses with its approach.
“Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection consists of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothes that are timeless and above-season.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and so there is no need for a discount," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant Graffiti Presents RAF Airman Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city management liked the proposal," said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intensive work.
He consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-<0xC5><0xA0>anov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, due to his Jewish background, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the street graphic art industry as Camo, has been working with spray paint in Teplice streets for over 20 years.
Graffiti began on the areas that were set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrives off the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna reached the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight CEST on Sunday night).
It struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and as it moved overland, it weakened to a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, have been reported, according to the AP.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday, recommending voluntary evacuations.
The strongest warning came from people in the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the total is expected to hit an area nearly 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous surf and a rare tornado can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (in the afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm moved in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by a wind of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it progressed to the mainland, which again knocked Hanna out of the category of hurricanes.
Local authorities urged residents to wait out the storm at home and not forget about hygiene measures related to the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to observe the distances, evacuations are also a great challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who had tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to bring face masks and disinfectant gels with them, if possible.
"We're not far behind.
We expect catastrophic flooding,” said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places up to 300 millimeters of precipitation could rain in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, together with sea level rise, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Lipko
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will hand over the rank of general to Colonel Pavel Lipko on Wednesday.
This follows from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for granting the rank of Brigadier General is Lipka's August assumption of the post of deputy commander of the alliance's multinational division in the north-east of Poland.
Lipka still acts as a deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel <0xC5><0x98>ehka as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Northeast Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance’s forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, <0xC5><0x98>ehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Office (N<0xC4><0x9A>KIB).
The government proposed to the president to give Lipko the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Law on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the period of the performance of an elected office or for the period of the performance of a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall be held by the rank of general.
The soldier to whom the rank has been conferred shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the rank.
The transfer of the rank shall continue until the reason for which it was granted has ceased to exist.
"Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
It plays a significant role in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June.
Wednesday’s promotion will take place at 12:30 at the Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the distance or wearing masks on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
Agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be sufficient fresh air in the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to take mid-size seats.
Common rules agreed upon by the officials shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
Arctic Svalbard has set a temperature record of almost 22 degrees.
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, exceeding the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard is warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers posed by warming in other parts of the Arctic, from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
The average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as 10 degrees unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard could result in the melting of permanently frozen soil, endangering the stability of many buildings, roads and airports, and could also cause more avalanches and landslides.
The warming climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet has also called on citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but people have to be isolated for two weeks after returning from them.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our top priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the Foreign Office said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries,” she said.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Britons are worried about being paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holiday.
For example, Neil Hunter from the city of Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, to depart on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
“We were supposed to go with the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what’s going to happen.
I work as a driver and I don’t think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation,” he said.
In connection with Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 new cases have been reported in 24 hours.
Authorities are already tightening coronavirus measures in some areas, such as Catalonia, which is trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government will discuss the model of buying electricity from Dukovany
The government on Monday will discuss a model of buying electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the buying-in price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek (ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ have previously said that a more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The project has been criticized by environmental groups.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials for the material.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at the Dukovan construction site to make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns a year will be for the family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay in electricity invoices every year to support the so-called supported sources.
He previously estimated that the purchase price could range between 50 to 60 euros (about CZK 1320 to 1600) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it should be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most supplied by traders, currently stands at around 45 euros (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With a difference in the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could pay a surcharge - it can correspond to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water," he said.
“We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative matter," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law envisages that the buy-out would be carried out by the MPO, or a legal entity authorized by it, owned by the state at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but at the latest until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
A low-carbon power plant is defined as an electricity plant with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek previously said that the new Ducovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed interest-free by the state during construction, while operating it is calculated with a 2% interest.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany was built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ CEO Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion crowns).
Agreements between the state and CEZ on the construction of a new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
According to the material, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic, the Office withdrew from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) of the server SeznamZprávy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in the eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan with the decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also recorded a decline in income.
The proposal has drawn criticism from both the opposition and tourism officials.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, the press, the Internet, billboards or squares at railway stations.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most of them would be acquired by private televisions Nova and Prima.
Printed diaries and weekly newspapers would receive $400 million, and the same amount would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for a media campaign, most of it again private stations.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and squares in railway stations and subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová said, without giving further details to the SeznamNews server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) would benefit from the advertisement.
"I firmly believe that this ostentatious disdain will be dealt a blow between the eyes in the election in the fall," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová rejects that this is really about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told Den<0xC3><0xAD>k N.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense of the media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," the head of the initiative, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the cock of beer and death like a blade of grass
Postmortem is also the third album entitled And Death is a blade of grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s discography, he is the fifth item and, as in previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s poetry, of which he is an excellent interpreter.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, 1949, of course, was influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passed on through his own personal experiences and also very intimate expressions of faith.
Of course, he was far away from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek), the masters will forgive.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>’s album offers recordings of his own reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, be it cellist Josef Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help myself - I like - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poems.
"Salala made them proud and unending bitterness," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is increasingly sinking into a dull consumer vanity and greed is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of – the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a longing in them for one who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest to anyone, but who also knew that they could not be renounced only because of a general lack of interest.
These poems reminded us that one might have to lose everything dear, but it is not unimportant how one loses it.
If he sells himself to the general decline, he resigns skeptically, is frightened to silence, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves.
“Paroubek is not my advisor,” Hamacek said.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, the former prime minister and chairman of the CSSD, is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party’s chairman and interior minister, Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamacek said this today on the TV program of the Prima Party.
On Friday, the news server SeznamZprávy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s advisor.
"We will write a text message from time to time, he will send me some material from time to time and I will read it," Hamacek said.
He added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"There's a lot of people like that reading his opinion sometimes," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "listen to the views of Václav Klaus openly".
According to him, this is all right, because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair out of it is a sign of this year’s cucumber season.
On Friday, SeznamZprávy.cz reported that Paroubek was acting as Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth candidate of the party in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region is former cell chairman Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamacek said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis is a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American sticker has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, beating him last year at a meeting of the NCAA.
“We had a battle a year ago, he won that battle and I was second, then we had a talk.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen says, who secured the victory with a 5.95-meter performance.
But Duplantis has since shot up steeply, and is now alone in the highest spheres of rodentry.
In only twenty years he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Toru<0xC5><0x84> he surpassed the 6.17 meter mark, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
“He jumped six metres when he was 18 when he graduated from high school,” says his World Athletics peer Nilsen.
“It was clear that as soon as he grew from a boy to a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
“Twenty years is a pretty good age to break a world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of achievements is a little thinner than Duplantis’, the American has similar goals.
He has so far indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he won regularly, this February he improved his internal personal record at one of them to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Panamerican Games in Lima, already in 2017 he entered the American race for the world championship, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself,” he realizes.
“If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan-American Games.”
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere duel for silver?
“Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don’t think that’s going to be possible anytime soon,” Nilsen said.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he will want to increase it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands on a disabled son's pension.
She's in court.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman could face up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his legal capacity and appointed his mother as a guardian, who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to this January, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her needs and deprived him of 440,000 crowns," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said in a statement, adding that she was adding that as a guardian, she had a special duty to protect the interests of the victim.
According to the court’s order, the woman set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs of her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment reads.
That he could not use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for their family expenses.
“We had trouble with our incomes to tighten the running of the household.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always about things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime,” the woman told police.
He promised to give the money back to his son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say
Findings from the Chiquihuite Cave in Zacatecas, Mexico, include 1,930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But there they are," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at a great altitude, inhabited for a long 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory has been that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
However, this model has been fractured in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports 42 different sites across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them came to America by ship.
"It's clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
Interest in tickets so far fills an optimistic scenario, say sellers.
Prices are also gradually falling.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing every week by up to 20 percent.
Thus, the development after the crisis, according to the sellers, meets the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
Among the most sought-after destinations are, according to sellers, mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
The Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz portal sells the most flights to Split, Croatia.
Of the other countries, Great Britain is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also falling.
The Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz portal was worth around CZK 6,250 in the middle of the month, CZK 3,000 less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
Prices in some European countries, such as Spain and Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, because they are afraid of the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time of buying a ticket before departure decreased by about ten days annually.
“This confirms the future trend, when people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indelá<0xC5><0x99>, vice president of products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
Compared to last year’s summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It features veteran 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the table.
However, he also managed to cope with James Wade and in the quarterfinals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"Flying Scot" was almost in the semifinals, facing Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in the extension and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovi<0xC4><0x8D> 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and just maybe the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old first surprisingly knocked out the world six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they also pushed Joe Cullen and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the beginning, but calmly playing the Belgian then with an excellent series gained a lead, which then more or less without problems held until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which put the occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the first discovery of the novel coronavirus in the Czech Republic in early March, 15,212 people have been confirmed to have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, 235 people tested positive, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of the week, 169 new cases were reported.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have already been cured of COVID-19, i.e. 63% of all those infected so far.
For most, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data of the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of them are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The highest number of infected people in the last seven days, per 100,000 inhabitants, is still in Karvina, at almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dek-M<0xC3><0xAD>stecko with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, including cultural and sporting events, as well as weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced by half from the current thousand people.
In the world, the number of people who have been infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the pandemic is being monitored globally.
The death toll from COVID-19 is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest one million infections added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which has already recorded more than 4.1 million cases, has been the biggest contributor to the rapid rise in cases in recent days, followed by Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
The number of infected people is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been reported globally from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily tally since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the United States, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases in the past week has grown in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has spread to nearly every country in the world, with the first case being officially reported today by North Korea.
The air in your home is five times worse than the air outside.
Health Harms Air Fresheners and Deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel’s environment ministry, household pollutants need to be addressed now that many people are spending more time working from home.
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the quality of indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forces people to work from home, people need to spend more hours at home than before, so it’s time to focus on air quality in homes,” she said.
In Israel, almost no one is concerned with the quality of "home air".
Dangerous things can be things that a person usually comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas is also emitted by the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
Children, elderly members of the household and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, fainting, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
Not all pollutants come from objects inside homes, and the source may also be the material from which houses are built.

Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominika's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gotta Dominica, the eldest daughter, told Aha!, adding that the Master couldn't figure out Havel's name and that whenever he was spoken, Karla was always angry.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but Dominica said the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"My father said in an article after the revolution that it was easier for him than for him.
That Havel could write in his drawer in the dark, but if he resisted in any way, his career would be over.”
But then he adds that in the end, the Czech greats finally found their way to each other.
"I know he couldn't have heard the word Havel until he was in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter on his birthday, and suddenly his father’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the then-former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because Mr. Havel's dad then regularly invited him to his house at Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k also said that he regretted that he had never received a state award from Václav Havel.
After all, he met him in 2009, even though it was already at the hands of his successor in the position of Václav Klaus (79).
In memoriam, the current president, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75), will be awarded the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
From Tuesday, the heat in the Czech Republic threatens, meteorologists warn of fires
The warning of meteorologists against high temperatures applies to Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia except for the Karlovy Vary region and also for southern and central Moravia.
"In exceptional cases, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to adhere to the drinking regime in the heat and to limit the body load in the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of precipitation, there will be a risk of fire from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists about the risk of fires concerns central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen regions.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant precipitations that would mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of the Czech Republic until at least the end of the week," the CHMI said.
Prague’s city hall responded to the meteorologist’s warning by banning fires at high-risk locations, which is due to begin on Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires, for example in parks, gardens or forests, up to a distance of 50 meters from the edge of the forest stands.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will apply until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman V<0xC3><0xAD>t Hofman said.
