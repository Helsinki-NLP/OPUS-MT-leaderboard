Inflation has soared in Europe due to food shortages.
Accelerated inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November's price growth in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6% in October, annual inflation of 3.1% was registered, the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union announced.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered its base interest rate, saying that a reduction in the interest rate, coupled with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, 2%.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must “relief” inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation is a 15-year record at 3.3 percent; in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has soared due to soaring food and energy prices.
Term wheat prices rose 88 percent, and soy prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month it already cost one barrel of black gold almost $ 100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent this year, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain at about 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz’s supporters had grown significantly after a prolonged stagnancy at the beginning of December, and it now has the largest camp since 2002, while the Gallup Institute has never seen such a low 13 percent support rate for socialists.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support compared to one-fifth of the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the survey, the IMF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party, there are supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The public’s view of the economy has also worsened due to the previous minimum – the ratio of those who consider the country’s economic situation to be very bad has never been so high – 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after the spring and summer more promising prospects now again more pessimistic.
As for next year, most of the population is counting on further deterioration and only a tenth on improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, the most of any Gallup poll to date, said the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is believed or very much believed by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán’s share of supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54%, and the leader of the Fidesz movement by 27%.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how a large part of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be solved without changing the government.
While after last October’s unrest, 35 per cent saw the retention of the government and prime minister as desirable, at present this share is only 20 per cent, with a relative majority (33 per cent) seeing a solution only in calling new elections.
For the interest in the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question regarding their possible participation that the referendum would definitely come, and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
By comparison, the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly have been attended by only 55 percent, and a further 15 percent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt based on current intentions.
A schoolboy would be told no to 74, a doctor's fee of 79, and hospital fees of 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people certainly promising their participation, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor’s fees and hospital fees would refuse 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more expensive Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs business triangle maintained an average 16 percent increase in the price level last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Newspaper article Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas shopping basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs trade triangle increased by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of more than a thousand forints.
Since the prices in supermarkets of food "outperformed" in December last year, the percentage did not show such a drastic increase due to the former high base.
However, it is certainly disappointing for consumers that what they could have bought last year for less than nine thousand forints, they will not buy now for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumable basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but they were very expensive for cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy seeds.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to those of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a pound of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the advance, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság, Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora appeared to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices listed in the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság increased by 15 percent compared to prices last Christmas Cora, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was on average 1,480.
The average price increase last year came to 1 206 forints, with prices being affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and it was obvious that department stores could not decide how large price ranges to set for individual products, since they could not predict what impact the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If a trader does not plan the speed of circulation of a given product correctly, he may lose a significant profit due to the price range adapted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT last year, the rise in the price of the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was 844 forints overall.
This year, the extreme difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive basket cost now 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one raised by 1,284 forints.
The comparison of the two Christmas seasons revealed a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months, the goods of daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not absolutely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured price increases exceeding 30 percent over 12 months for several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, since the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, showed, given the base, even in the worst case, a price growth of hardly more than 10 percent.
Flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push through drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trade golden triangle do not complain, they still report a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything quanta, they take durable food on wages.
On Wednesday morning, long queues at checkout counters formed in all three supermarkets as the number of visitors soared.
However, as we know, the turnover in the countryside is lower, several international chains complain to research companies that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overcrowding of staff to stop diseases do not help, according to the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John’s Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who was rushed to hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed yet.
Until this December 10, 1,094 hospital-acquired infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czová, the head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, the rest are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
SA infections (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are given excessively or inappropriately, the antibiotic-responsive bacterium will develop into a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients over the years, it can cause serious hospital infections, for example, an early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such an infection is a daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the causative agent of the disease is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and in a mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital-acquired MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favorable for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czová.
Since this infection occurs characteristically in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals receiving patients should check and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
It is also important to note that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests.
Most cases are thus detected if the patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment with antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological testing should be carried out, in order to prevent the development of drug resistance, but even hospitals do not adhere to this in all cases.
Sampling of microbiological samples is even rarer in basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czová said.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but even in hospitals, serious deficiencies are manifested.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czová noted, unfortunately, we can also encounter the fact that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, they are saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, which increases the chances of developing infections even more.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there are demonstrably fewer such infections or the further spread of the causative agent of the disease can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has drawn up a program to prevent MRSA, or reduce its occurrence.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England are showing a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) prioritises the prevention of multi-drug-resistant disease (MRSA) and hospital-acquired infections caused by these diseases.
The police officer who caused the accident was not drunk.
The official expert report in the case of the police captain of the XXII district, who caused the fatal accident, is ready.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and has since stepped down from his post, could have been driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, a spokesman for the capital’s High State Prosecutor’s Office, Attila Morvai, said on Friday after the case’s expert report was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then director of the police department of the XXII district on Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha street in the XXII district with his own personal car while turning a 55-year-old man who entered in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian crossed outside the zebra, after all, according to the rules of the road is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with prosecutors carrying out investigations from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the now signed agreement covers the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A loan agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million is also used for budget financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million could be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will use mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of a fourth metro line.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of metro financing, it will revert to whether and how the original agreement should be modified.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year grace period and without a commitment fee shall be fixed at the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astounding - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the still cheapest, but fast-rising EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for property purchases is now without a doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
Of the mountains, Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vito<0xC5><0xA1>a are the most in the course, Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar are on the seashore, but more and more people are also looking for properties near Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract investors, and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
Also, the capital city of Sofia is a promise of enticing opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a sought-after travel destination in addition to the summer and winter seasons in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers could be divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated real estate worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who are buying in the hope of an increase in value in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is constant, as the demand is growing stronger.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, it has grown by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The increase in property prices far outweighs the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, expert meetings will be closed on Tuesday, and after Wednesday's official opening, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses the efforts following the period of emission reductions defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a tumultuous debate between developing and developed countries about them.
The United States has also announced that it does not now wish to negotiate exact figures, although it is committed to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The next big question of the conference is whether developed countries, in addition to reducing emissions, will also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that rely on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, set by the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a 16-member governing council, most likely under the United Nations’ World Environment Programme (GEF) – we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to commit to up to 30 percent reduction if other developed regions of the world, respectively developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set a reduction target of 5.2 per cent, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8 per cent.
The obligation of Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the years 1985-87, which our country will fulfill.
In Bali, this is a big deal, because an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would move with certainty only to 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new emission reduction system, the necessity of which in its latest report was also pointed out by the international scientific body of the UN, the IPCC dealing with climate change.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
British troops are posting videos of themselves popularizing events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server.
The British Air Force (RAF) first liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of anti-Taliban actions since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command, which is in charge of combat operations in the Kandahar area, and then sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A Political Message is Inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of soldiers of the British air force have already been made on the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have already looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenseheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos as originally intended for recruitment purposes, and according to the Department of Defense, they are also good for acquainting the general public with the real purpose of the army’s presence abroad.
"Promotions published in this form are almost worthless compared to traditional TV recruitment ads," defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, "but they also necessarily carry a political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also uploaded to the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers mostly talk about losses, but the bloody form of the fight is not shown.
After all, many videos from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, have already been published on the Internet, but the British army has only just come to them now.
The Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with raffles and pajamas
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to her pajamas and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, in others it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere with raffles and toasts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - that's how the powerful have fun.
State officials are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas, orphans will receive gifts from the children of fallen soldiers, during Mission Christmas they will host family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort spends 25 million on the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are kicking each other out compared to other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the center of J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91> Ház, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and from the six hundred employees of the Ministry, about three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will follow the Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and raffle draws.
Christmas NF<0xC3><0x9C> cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> departments is invited to another Christmas celebration: the tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money, will organize here.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gszinház theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were unable to reach the person concerned.
No dress needed
The OIT building hosted not only the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia Ball instead of Christmas on 7 December.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with a toast to the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball were not mandatory evening dress or suit.
The Puritan party is being prepared by the health, labor and local government departments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and a celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperthová does not even officially invite her co-workers to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pajamas, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will drink a toast in the hall of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, where it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he devotes 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with buffets and a toast.
Since becoming Minister János Veres, PM staff have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality is enhanced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Ministry of Agriculture holds a New Year's reception on January 20, and the Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Gardens and according to the Ministry’s announcement, 1,000 forints per person will be allocated for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short toast by the minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the portal [origo].
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of the Environment in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
He is going on a huge strike.
The League, or National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s unlimited strike.
On Saturday there is a protest public assembly, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance - the work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause serious traffic disruptions, as rail transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League, together with the National Union of Workers' Councils, will present the details of Monday's strike.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly is held, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for ending the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not adopt the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the health insurance law will not be voted on until late in the evening or at night.
Due to the beginning of the strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious interruptions of transport: on the railway, work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of the Budapest public transport can be stopped, and more than half of the companies of Volán.
At the same time, half of the country’s railways will also be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for the strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period, others announced a temporary suspension of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, from the beginning of operation until 1 p.m., the strike will be held at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, the Union of Educators and the Democratic Union of Educators called for a 2- and 2- or 8-hour stoppage respectively.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Care (EDDSZ), a member of the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SHEF), is staging a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions in force from next year be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, to ensure that early retirement for the relevant professions can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the Liga trade union association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Raises Country's Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital Institute.
The "risk warning" developed by the company says: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "by aggravating the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may occur in a short time."
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political representatives: "public discussion on the Roma issue was left to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction."
This deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict.
In addition, the activity of the Hungarian Guards, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "largely damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic development."
As part of the reorganisation of Hungary's radical and far-right groups, which have been gaining more and more publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, the Institute recalls that several organisations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves "national militias" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, invasion of the homeland, violation of order), moreover, with reference to the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
All this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap all sorts of political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups is therefore not only used to avoid legal obstacles to judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the region," he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
She used the BNU to establish the Guard, saying the organization's goal was "national militia".
According to her, in the past 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the Institute Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a stormy discussion among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they will form their own guard in the face of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way by setting up their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
When asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital Institute, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if they find something that could affect the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are strictly defined by law and it has become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which is less likely to happen next year.
In the European Union and in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Days of work rest are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work holiday - on New Year's Day, so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15 celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and October 23, the memorial day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, there are two-day holidays of Easter, Christmas and Christmas.
Since our national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would work only one day before or after a public holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that the previous Saturdays we stayed at the workplace and at school.
When we work out the day immediately preceding or following the holiday, the Minister of Labour has been regulating it in a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or with regard to their destination, they operate even on days of rest.
This year, there will be a change in the working schedule only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because, according to experience so far, most people will "work out" or use the saved vacation days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is changed around Labor Day so that workers can then stay at home for four days of good taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will take place instead of Friday, October 24.
At the end of the year, however, next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have non-stop holidays almost everywhere, despite the fact that New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Disturbing Little Things You Can Do to Infuriate Your Colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies we hardly notice anymore: they all “spend” the day in the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves, and avoid unclear situations that may make others angry.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed a meeting because of it?
At best, he regrets it and will try to fix it, or he will call the marketing department and say that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is solved by one apology.
Before you make an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about how you can prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more unpleasant than when you reach for some document, office supplies or for your phone, and they are not there.
Remember you put a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find a pen on the table of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will rightly be angry at you for going through their affairs.
Do not take away envelopes or sticky notes from the office, because it can be uncomfortable when you run out prematurely, and you will need them immediately.
Rumors about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spreading rumors.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone about your colleagues’ private lives!
When one of them shares his innermost secret with you, don’t abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence with a severe headache because you are not feeling well, or you think that you would rather rest today, think about the fact that someone else will have to do your work, urgent tasks and work for which they have a certain deadline for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and supervisors are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Humping, giggles, phone calls
Have you immersed yourself in a work from which you are rudely snatched by the giggles of colleagues?
Have you accidentally witnessed a phone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, singing, talking loudly (over their heads), or stomping, cursing constantly, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame the mistakes of others?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other person for your forgetfulness!
Do not appeal to any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you could put things in order, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Sweaters and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear casual clothing, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a casual dress - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a man wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio, a special melody is heard: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the tempo and the bass is added to the previous tonal tones, then the female chorus is added as a real gem.
Zagar's song "Wings of Love" is featured on mr2.
Home music life has not spoiled us for a long time with high-quality electronic pop.
All of a sudden, the constipation looks quite different, because you're listening to the new Zagaru album.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and although garage rock is back in fashion with its beat to the guitar, even domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started out in the Pentecostals, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until eventually - perhaps because the two bagpipes couldn't fit into the same chard - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k's film "The Season").
His formation, playing in the beginnings of smaller clubs, was recognized by a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entities determining the development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "on course," though of course no one asked them if they were happy with this label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open up new avenues for them, though the title itself attempts to build a continuity with the early flights in the Pentecostal.
This is a verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zságer.
A reference to the ethereal, flying would be appropriate, but in addition to the ethereal touch of this music has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, singer Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the album in Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi’s mr2 station, which plays popular music from morning to evening, we started to get caught up in the sweeping melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six local singers (“Underground Divas”).
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu portal interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is how much of what you play remains marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and can also be created just for the sake of selling, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude, as it is accepted, operates independently of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers and people in their twenties go to concerts there, but also older people.
They are much more aware of the transformations of light music taking place around them, because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where, and how much of your music is being listened to?
B. Zs.: Of course it feels good that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the imperceptible changes of the moment.
Yet I have noticed that when a person wants to please the audience, from that moment on, he ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow Yonderboie’s example?
He works solo and has built his career rather than us in the West.
B. Zs.: We do not actually follow his path, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music in this way.
We are more like team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was impossible not to compare our work with the songs of Yonderboie, because several of us separated from his band and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love reached number one on Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi's Mr2 Toplist.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, have you consciously opened up to the wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn’t plan to write a hit song to sell the album.
There's more to the song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, with which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
HVG.HU: How did you choose these six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to assemble this choir of soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir -- Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -- came together, which we then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that what you meant by the song, or did the girls create something on it?
B.Zs.: The song has existed in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material was assembled on the album, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
A succession of chords led to the addition of a singing part.
I sang a tune to him that night, which the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took Diva to do it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work this energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don’t have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don’t have a role of their own, they sing together completely, and they aren’t louder than the music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were also in the back of the stage.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we did not want to divide the solo roles is, on the contrary, intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where we come from, where we belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
HVG.HU: Which was the most work?
B.Zs.: While composing music, not even one, heavier pieces occurred during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he did not want to work groove, then everything slowly found its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is constantly changing with the gigging and the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Betrayal Broker Risked Billions on Undervaluation
Treacherous embezzler.
This is how French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka in the Czech Republic, describes his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
He lost almost five billion euros because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compete with his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market ahead of time.
"He's mentally weak," said his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But according to Kerviel’s statement, made by French media outlets such as Le Monde, he was a man who made 1.6 billion euros in profits from his trades at the end of last year.
The crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros on the American crisis.
I felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had repayment problems in the past, will have problems.
However, the crisis did not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and made the right bet.
At the end of the year, its profit climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
He admits throughout the interrogation that he falsified the records so that he would not be found.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his trades.
The risk was profit.
Was he afraid he'd be found?
No, I don't.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to take so many risks?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 shortly after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares Allianz earned, in the bombings of London bet on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the chiefs said they knew all about it, or rather suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, they would close their eyes."
But then came the morning of the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday, of which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the next years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program is designed to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in drawing money from EU funds within the newly admitted countries.
20-year sentence for Nicaraguan ex-president confirmed by court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alaman, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time.
According to the head of the appeals court, Ileana Perez, it will now depend on prison officials whether they let Aleman serve his sentence at home or if he goes to prison.
A court four years ago proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of that money then ended up in the fund Alemán set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
What makes this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year it passed with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD last year, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic was happening this time.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this traditionally ignored, although the most influential, law calmly.
It's a kind of paradox.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power struggle with the opposition.
This is more media grateful and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
The guesswork of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the hard numbers.
State budgets in past Social Democratic governments have suffered from three ailments that the 2008 one is unable to solve at once:
The first is the high share of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second one is deficit management as a result of the first one’s ailment.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
A time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax money, fees, and bank loans, to obtain additional resources for investment, often recklessly issued bonds that disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state from privatization.
They no longer have that source.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years, which is why it is constantly boasting of the CSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state became increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our republic.
It is a great shame, which falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, in recent years have unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions.
While some of the senseless populist spending approved this year before the elections has been scrapped, if the retirement age and pension reform are not pushed back soon, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and whoever rules will be mere administration.
With a little exaggeration, we can say that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money to pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the extortion of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
A planned deficit of $70 billion in 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments did not do what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only they will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis.
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will be auctioned off in foreign exchange markets.
In these auctions, banks are auctioning off the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will auction off $40 billion, while another $24 billion will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is designed to address the biggest challenge facing the economy, the growing lack of free capital that banks can lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, a consultancy, said in a report to clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more.
“Central banks must be really worried about what else might follow when they decide to do this,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into a recession with potential implications for global economic growth.
Central banks made the decision after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio, a Tempus Consulting firm, told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks will help to avert the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Environmental debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been levelled at the closing UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue Planet, Not Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, consisting of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that its topic is very important for him and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appeared in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only with caricatures of my views".
Now, then, those interested can read his undistorted views.
Klaus reminded that although he is not a climatologist, he has, in his opinion, enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and evaluate scientific papers, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main conclusions of the book, he called the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver was unable to replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange the old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can apply for an exchange, so that the authorities still have time to issue them a new card by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will go on the road.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in changing their driver's licenses, authorities in the metropolis are swamped with applications and interest in changing their licenses has risen this week.
The City Council handles about 2,000 clients per day.
It takes about half an hour in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not have a mandatory replacement by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, a police officer may also deal with the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, he could receive a fine from the city hall and a person who does not go anywhere.
He was also reportedly able to pay $30,000.
The ministry had earlier called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is in danger of being fined tens of thousands of euros.
A driver’s license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that every person must have.
People who don’t want to drive anymore should give up their driver’s license.
It is enough to take it or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
By the end of the year, the certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
Motorcyclists also need to change their driving licence.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
With final effect, the Prague High Court decided to reduce their sentences, one by a year and the other by two years.
Initially, the detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is waiting for the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in excess of 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, the majority of the accused have rejected the charges, claiming that it is a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang paid 30 percent for the magnifying glass for Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The charges relate to the gang's criminal activities from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to their health, as well as abuse of power by a public official and illegal arming.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a laser sight or a machine gun.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still testifying before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived before the court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child-replacement bill: 12 million
In exchange for the children in the maternity hospital, Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the injured families, is seeking compensation of CZK 12 million, plus court costs, after the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital.
For each of the mothers three million, for the father two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, the legal representative of the hospital, therefore fundamentally disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But in order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has had to draw up.
Let's see if it has any telling value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for every month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb used it as a basis for negotiating an expert opinion on compensation, which was prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress in varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they were faced with the reproach that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, are less able to cope with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, summed up the content of Veleb.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> maternity hospital last December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Cermáks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslav Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the head of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vypus<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed over CZK 100,000 to each of the families to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damage.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach out to the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the help of the founder.
Courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup Lost to the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the name was first used by the Wallachian king, but the project was built by a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor.
Soup did not participate in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolko Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone at the words of the Wallachian Kingdom remembers the actor and comedian.
Harabish has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
“Getting money and taking action,” he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
“Years later, they realized the project was a success and could make a difference.
They want to parasitize our work,” he added.
The lucrative business
According to the court, the name was first used by the Wallachian king Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At the time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary action resulted in trade and lucrative business activity, which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then continued with the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to include his name and signature in the passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea that Soup published in the arena for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's project of the Kingdom of Wallachia certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, which was intensively dedicated to him.
Cooperation between the parties in dispute today continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, culminating in the deposition of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I elected to the throne".
Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, the singer, took the lead role in the kingdom as the queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which was rejected by the court today.
Clearly, Harabish's planned bid for the throne and half of the princess could lead to a dispute.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not disclose the details or the date.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the King's Ride in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also apply," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
To tell you the truth, I've never been much of a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of gearing, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below-average.
But the successor to the Peugeot 207 is now on the market, and it is much better.
And the van called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaint, because the body of the station wagon means that even two-meter-long ones will not suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the interior very quickly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where the only reproach I have to the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The lateral line has also improved significantly against the 206.
As for the space, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
In the van then disappears the already mentioned lack of space above the head.
Suitcases for suitcases
The main thing on this car is its luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very easily accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as a decent storage.
Deaf spots are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, they can be stretched and at the same time they can hold even heavier objects.
But let's pause on the volume together.
According to the tables in the basic layout, it is 428 l, which is rather an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot lags by a very noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6 l petrol four-cylinder with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old who runs a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda analogy, which sometimes seems to have a stuffed rag in the exhaust, I can only be delighted with it.
The price tag says
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a 14-cylinder petrol engine for CZK 329,900 will still go up.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then add equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK to the top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs just 531 900 CZK.
It’s a lot, but count the extras at Fabia and you’ll come up with a very similar number.
All you have to do is decide on a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There is an increase in children from Eastern European countries in British schools, which raises concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles so far.
British schools are even registering cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children escalate into violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Quarrels, bullying and fights between the pupils were also transferred to the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far as to arrest a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The guilty woman defends herself for being insulted by the boy with racist slurs.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly treated the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“As we were going home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us, and then he exposed his ass," the mother of Slovak students told The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the local residents even described disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who have come here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean, you will find it in full and even richer enumeration.
But there is much more to be found on just one island, and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and transfer of treasures that the Spaniards in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially during the prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were Mt.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings grew up in Havana, cars drove along the broad boulevards, which belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farmhouse in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and owned a yacht in Coimbra.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can also sign your autograph on the walls of Bodeguita, Havana.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails will be mixed according to your wishes.
And the iconic cars of the 1950s still drive around Havana, because the once imported giguli and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is quite dilapidated, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there are there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another pleasure, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
A third of the vast plantations were transported to the sugar mills by steam and motor trains on narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so they can see working machines, whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not miss.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Just to remind you that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate and who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from a limestone substrate.
Mogotes, limestone mounds and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavities a fertile soil is captured, thanks to which even weathered rocks are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Some may find it interesting that the Chilean part of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad (province)
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought him fame and wealth.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and showiness of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay out of it.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was disturbed, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, it’s worth taking a look at nearby attractions such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n or the Sugarloaf Valley.
In the evening, you can go to Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly, such an opinion is already influenced by the path itself.
The two roads that lead from Guantanamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and traverse nature that has hardly been marked by human activity.
The eastern island of Cuba has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus’ voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today’s Hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the cabaret of Tropicana, the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves, many pages could be described about all this.
But, as they say, it is better to see once.
U.S. allies in Afghanistan are passive, say U.S.
Few troops and lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, eight of the participating states are also discussing other plans and coordinating allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for NATO troops to be more active, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and stepping up development aid.
"Developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to allow people to start developing the economy and security themselves,” Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is the highest in the last five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent incidents rose by 27 percent compared to last year, and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We’re going to have to seriously think about the specific goals for the future and how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the combat demands are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern parts of the country,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
“Afghan faggots exposed: Germans playing while our boys fight,” Sun wrote in the footage, accompanied by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
A German Bild counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt to rise to $1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over CZK 84,000.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government is planning to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could overcome the CZK 1 trillion limit only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and a trillion," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could exceed one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts are growing
The national debt is the debt of the central government and arises primarily from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt so far this year has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt so far this year increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“Overall debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade with when there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
According to the state debt financing and management strategy for 2007, the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, there are planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday evening and expelled, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils give a teddy bear the name Mohammed despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was beaten with a whip.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and insurgency under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins as early as the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
“There are eight names coming out of the children’s mouths, among them Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s headmaster.
After a class vote, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Muhammad as their most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: “My name is Mohamed.”
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the difficulty is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One Muslim colleague, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: “I only regret asking children to vote for a name,” he said, adding that it was “an innocent mistake.”
This view is shared by many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and add that "she never talks about religion in class".
Mohammed is also the second most commonly given first name in the UK, with fourteen different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible to give them a toy?
Of course, it is a question of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations, this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Failure, after all.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome divergent views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides were not able to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep the peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiations will end on December 10.
Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population is expected to be clearer by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN mandated the Troika to renegotiate in August this year.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to end on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this latest deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favor of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West considers Kosovo's EU-supervised independence to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favor, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where the "last chance talks" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Tha<0xC3><0xA7>i, the former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and the future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domain effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the province's unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But that does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"Kosovo's parliament will have the last word"
"The only solution that is acceptable for Serbia is a solution that comes from the Security Council," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“This meeting took two years.
It must end as it began: on the soil of the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be given to the Kosovo parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be "upon agreement" with the West.
Bush demands agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his urging, US President George W. Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides stemming from the “road map” to peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the Abbas-led negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are aimed at “concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.”
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US president, stressing that the follow-up talks should be "whole and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert then addressed the rostrum, expressing his opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort should be made to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush has set the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his “two-state vision”, Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had made a commitment to that effect before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and against its central aspects,” Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-language newspaper backed by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the black chronicle, the official versions do not coincide with what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car drove on Sunday shortly after 5 p.m. on Louise-Michel street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
“The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and was traveling at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not turned on,” the police source explained.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore not authorized to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, drove "at a very high speed".
“The motorcycle hit the police car from the left side after not giving priority to the right side,” one police officer said.
The blood alcohol level test performed on the vehicle crew turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, shattered front glass, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of unintentional killing and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which was also taken over by the directorate of the département of the département de p<0xC3><0xBB>té.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation led by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
The three witnesses who were interrogated on Sunday night confirmed “the version of the police officers, namely that the mini-engine approached them quite quickly from the left”.
A rifling, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the clipsen against the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the moment when the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people quickly spread the word that police officers should have quickly left the scene without providing first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should, with all due care, also rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which one needs to be very careful," the police source said.
The newspaper "Liberation" met with an eye-witness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“Immediately, together with my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, we rushed down to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a limping, completely frightened police officer.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone.
In the face of rapidly increasing tension and the certainty that the situation of the youths was hopeless, the police officers were driven away by car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left.”
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not come to the aid of the young people.
These young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades, which witnesses say were used by law enforcement forces.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
A few of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access roads to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent assembly.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president “encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and garbage to those who swore an oath before Musharraf.”
"Musharaf's promise is not valid"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is a direct target of a state of emergency announced on Saturday night.
In the following days, he was to comment on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election held on October 6.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, the president of the court, was removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the official told The News.
The promise of Musharraf to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "is not valid" after the introduction of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation that a deputy army chief should have ordered President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unexpected.
This includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected today, according to a study led by France’s Institut national d’études démographiques (Ined) – the National Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which made contraception legal in France.
This includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The legalization of contraception has allowed for better “fertility control,” the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age has now risen from 5% in 1970 to 60%.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One in five births is even calculated per month precisely and if possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
For more than seven hours of space work, astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel, necessary for the station’s continued scientific activity.
It was a risky ascent into space that set records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the amount of "kitchening" the astronauts spent on repairs.
The trouble surfaced on Tuesday, while the Discovery astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science lab (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for module-laboratories.
They need to be able to supply electricity.
The crew’s second task, therefore, was to move the 17-and-a-half-ton solar-powered module already on the ISS to its final location.
After moving it, the crew began to dismantle the module's sixty-seven-meter solar panels.
And in this one of the panels, unfolding like a pulling accordion,as a result of the pinching of the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Unfolding has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a check-up on the Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had malfunctioned, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the robot arm of the ship, attached to the station arm, and perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the American Bureau of Aviation and Space (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very dexterous, has a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession of a doctor was commissioned to "operate" a "wounded" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed a kind of "sludge" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker, who remained close to the containment chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey coated with an insulating agent to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and “made in a DIY way” by astronauts aboard the station.
At the end of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully disassembled, then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are sizable at the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defense industry company announced it would have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion to cope with the A400M’s delays.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reassess its estimated production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the launch flight.
The price for easing delays in deliveries of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European designer EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday when it presents its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS’ production results fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Decisions on the status quo
Sunday’s election will take place without tense expectations: Russians will overwhelmingly elect President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Thus confirming, after the end of very little free election campaign, its tendency towards stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will tell voters on public broadcasters a pre-recorded TV message, the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that appears to be celebrating a landslide victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president let nothing come out of him and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of meddling — his favorite campaign theme.
“We know the value of true democracy and we wish for honest, transparent and open elections, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that “there has never been such a dirty election, not even under Yeltsin.”
Following last weekend’s crackdown, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyers.
"Russians have a homo soviet mentality"
Against the backdrop of these tense parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are being profiled:
Who will be Putin’s successor in office?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
There is no follower, however.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which chooses a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in parliamentary as well as presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have left the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel they are the masters of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University notes a more distant connection: civil society has been delayed in this country, Christianized five centuries after Europe; that glorious common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin continued the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not accompany terror, but a certain economic well-being," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Endowment.
The Russians are now "voluntarily relinquishing personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) manage local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, too, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 45-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which recount the fate of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) for 27 km have so far been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or his/her beneficiaries.
Eleven states tasked with managing the archives — including Germany, France, Israel and the United States — agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to study "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced labourers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour subjected to civilians, bringing them evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
“Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t’s Center for the Study of Antisemitism in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to reach free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April last year, the EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already reaches almost 60 billion euros annually.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
“The free trade agreement is a tremendous complement to both economies,” and “India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mr Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commission president said. The Asian and European giant together will replace "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" annually, said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting the fact that the European giant has been in business all along.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Thursday it intended to ease current concerns about worsening credit conditions again and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an unusually long offer.
“In an effort to allay concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks more certainty about how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a statement.
The bank says <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at a base interest rate.
This appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It normally takes a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it “remains prepared to take further measures to keep the interbank lending rate at par with its base rate on an interim basis.”
The interbank interbank interest rate stood at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the charge rates that deterred banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculations reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many have opted for amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with Socialist (PS) proposals on purchasing power
UMP and the Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist bill, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law came within the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by an individual parliamentary club) and included a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which were an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, a transport check or rent regulation.
Given that the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised speech on purchasability.
MP Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the Finance Bill, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born
In the wake of much speculation that C3 Presents is establishing a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Melvin Benn’s Festival Republic, has announced the new festival.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a man who has unquestionably inspired the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of Billboard.com’s C3.
The C3 is produced by the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer camper's destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, made him one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 he founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” he has ever experienced, saying his firm and Melvin Benn’s firm are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
“Initially, we chose Philadelphia as our market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"I spoke to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, we got bogged down in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we’ve had the opportunity to discuss this with Melvin Benn and we’re going to establish a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Grant Park, Chicago, in 2005, after excelling on the festival scene with the 2002 Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales for both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M respectively.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benn Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in the green spaces of cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way, so as to create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe and an urban one in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims that they are “enough to allow investment in such an event and welcome the festival, which will hopefully have a long duration”.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is “very high,” similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which seats 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the programme is yet to be released to the press.
“Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences as much as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3’s partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal, when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasive mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is “politically challenging” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns “runaway productions.”
Is it hard to fall into the "Governor's" claws?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our job is to offer the ones they think are the best,” he said.
The Hunt for Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is to promote the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about introducing Quebec movies, bringing them to the spotlight, and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness was well-received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon on the stock exchange at the end of the year? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
There are less than five weeks left until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already holding hands with me in anticipation of the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif Bank believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange."
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, the markets present, at least in the short term, certain doubts.
These experts do not assume that the stock market is moving in the last weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income influenced by the effect of turnover on high-quality securities, both in long and short segments".
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "primarily because the impact of the likely fall in the Fed's rates is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of stimulus to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s head of sales in Spain, agrees it’s not the right time to make bold statements about the marathon.
“There’s not much to be happy about,” the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes the Ibex 35 could end the year slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to the portfolio reshuffling and traditional supplementary pension contributions that occur every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are getting closer to the technical levels and "therefore we could observe the reflection of the index, caused by reports from the US about the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of titles that will take care of bringing Ibex to new maximum dimensions.
Intermoney’s Solana confirms that “this year is a series of strong titles”.
This expert would include both big banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Building companies will also be able to get rich on this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been repositioning for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will also perform very well, although they are not very represented on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a month of declines in only two cases.
The real year-end marathon took place in 2003, the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (Ibex has increased by 8.36 percent since January) and whether it will manage to have its own marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the brand Popular Max are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that has decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to strike a deal with the unions to abolish 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be crucial for other entities to join or not to join this initiative, which supports opening hours.
This is exactly the goal of the project set by the Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, entrepreneurs and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as it is not opening new branches, but only modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
The extension of the opening time is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, said the restructuring would not involve a large investment, but would involve more recruitment, as it would shift from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Branches in Madrid’s streets of Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a were selected, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrant specialists, who operate under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, with many of its branches offering a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera says.
They just made a deal with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell the phones through external personnel.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock market
We did it.
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s executive chairman, expressed his satisfaction at the end of trading, when he noted that the TV he manages doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: ‘what I regret is that it wasn’t because we grew more, but because we fell less,’ he said.
And he stressed that due to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a 2.54% move.
This profit pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%), according to Bloomberg data, thus reaches 4 488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antenna 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and fell 40.5% overall since January, has a half-value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were valued at $3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, $2.518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and $1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we evaluate it in ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel this year to surpass a billion gross ad revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s ad arm.
If the projected figures were to be achieved, the channel would see a 3.6% increase in ad revenue this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antenna 3’s net sales increased by 1.6% (to 734.4 million) in the first nine months of the year, while its net revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, distributed 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, for whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently downgraded its Telecinco profit estimates to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, the projected revenue growth stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3’s projected profit by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress Approves MiFID Transposition Effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by a congressional vote on the Senate amendments to the bill, the government has submitted to a public hearing a regulation that develops the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial advisory firm (ESIS), financial advisory firm (AFI) that joins securities firms, securities brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for executing transactions in financial instruments is expanding by connecting multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of dealing with risk on the market and requires a statement of all operations performed to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During its deliberations in the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which the one that stands out is that securitized receivables are considered a “complex” financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor that has been demonstrated by what has happened in the U.S. with high-risk subprime mortgages.
Moreover, the transposition of the directive has been used to legally define the functions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold 30 years after the Royal Decree was adopted in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and client acquisition for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator shall be calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute of Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will become known on 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% is a "temporary number", but at the same time predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified on the sidelines of Congress that “although it will not be a favorable number,” Spain’s inflation differential against the monetary union has remained “more or less” the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the economy minister said of the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank was managing record deposits of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually fell over the course of two and a half months despite the fact that the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and will extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the name of the entity with its Virgin Money business name, needs to raise about a quarter of the income invested in British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for his striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked the Virgin consortium’s offer, which consists of three other companies, as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices during construction
The Civil Guard today arrested the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totana (from the People’s Party) in the early hours of the morning for his alleged involvement in corruption practices during construction, which were revealed this week.
One of the city councillors and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People’s Deputy and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Caden SER television, could have been the “head” of the entire company.
Police officers continue to monitor the town hall and building commission buildings, and further arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corruption practices during the construction that were revealed earlier this week, was charged.
As reported by Cadena SER yesterday, the lawyer of the "people's" deputy Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, Morales is also being investigated for allegedly collecting commissions for his signature of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted an offer to lead Toledo's PSOE candidate and, if they win, to chair Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialists José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election, and if the socialists win the general election, they will become the president.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE for the José Blanco organization and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place at noon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The head of the executive committee justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and leave his active political career to focus on combating climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the top politics he abandoned two years ago.
He went on to say that, just as citizens know who will be the deputy economy minister if PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to "transparently" announce who will chair Congress.
If Bono wins the post, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect, not scolding or screaming" and make it "more and more like citizens."
“Unfortunately, sometimes the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak calmly and peacefully is in Congress, the prime minister in the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion.”
He also lauded current President Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good work" and did not want to introduce himself in his place, lest he be reduced to what he said his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate firm cohesion.
Moreover, to have a leader of a movement that is a prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a “new treaty with the planet”.
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's action or inaction has contributed significantly to Spain's leading the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, will we have to accept and what will be the economic consequences.
In other words, who is sacrificing and who is paying to save the planet.
But we have not seen such explanations, nor will we see them.
It is because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centime of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party), seemed to Zapatero so risky in terms of elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, with pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not blame, does not demand anything, but is an ornament of meetings and excites tenderness.
If it is limited to being only a virtual contracting party and does not require us to ride a bike and cool down with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany arrested on suspicion of corruption practices during construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totana, the “people’s man” José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now being held along with a number of police officers who also arrived at the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Land and Apartments.
These three arrests add to six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of farmland to land suitable for development, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4 000 houses there.
In addition, two other people were not arrested, but are charged in a shortened procedure in the court of first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six suspects were brought to trial today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totany and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (province of Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M. G., the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company belonging to that group, through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is being carried out by the Crimes Unit in the Construction of the Civil Guard Operational Central Unit, whose members, in addition to the arrests, have also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totán.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in the area, a well-known poultry meat company owner who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned as the largest residential complex of the Murcia city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the population of the municipality, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonoar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of Finland's most important newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn's book happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the city of Jokela.
The killer of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the education councilor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One colleague reports on the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal plates in the store for less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you steal up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in trade, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to take part in a fight than to exchange compacts.
Participating in the riot has a rate of three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be the rate of six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So, if my colleague is not mistaken, someone missed the hand, and quite a lot.

My attending physician shoves me one of his articles about strange research titled “Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less.”
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the neurocognitive imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The biggest activation occurred when the participant in the study responded correctly and his colleague misreacted.”
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one was given twice, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutors of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the Prosecutor’s Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits in the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.

Which insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driver's license, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive the agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking over the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving license, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies have concluded that married people have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journeys and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in the frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the premium price.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the insurance that best fits his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and a short driving licence, when they want to arrange insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance premiums so as to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the client’s participation in the insurance event.
"The part of the payment of the insured event provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the insurance premium, which will be the higher, the lower the participation would be," explains Luis Noguera, Chief Executive Officer of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation so that the client insures against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the mentioned basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years, drivers have it easier when they go to arrange insurance, as the client’s risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people are usually not able to benefit from the experience gained in advance when an accident occurs, or even while driving," says the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "newbie's fear" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married, but does not have children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if, of course, his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their management is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,” Luis Noguera said.
Pensioners are recommended to have insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance premium (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us most given our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to get an AC Milan point, which means the eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will face off this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an attempt to score the point they lack to reach their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as for the Italians it would be a first and for the Scots it would decide the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in the fifth game by a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to be sure that Shakhtar will not get ahead of him with six points, who will play with Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will take place a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play their first 13th semi-final, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others, and a tie at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to fight for the victory, because the Italians will not want to play on home soil and Celtic knows that after winning he would be first and would secure a better place in the semifinals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even lose if Shakhtar does not win, but he cannot rely on it, because with the same number of nine points, Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2: 0) will lose.
And so AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will reach the semifinals in the re-organized Champions League for the second time, just as they defeated them in the same match in the last competition with a goal of Kaka in the overtime (1:0) after the 0:0 condition in the base game.
The hope that the Rossoneri will win will be Shakhtar, for whom the victory is worth, only if Celtic loses, both for advancing to the semi-finals and for remaining in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and does not have the opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so it would play in UEFA.
20,000 people attended the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 people after breaking up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, the bands "re-proclaimed their connection".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video depicting the history of the group, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as the release of a new album, released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the stage decorated with bracelets, which they were gifted by the husband of "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, despite the nervous Victoria forbade him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness in a meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I’m glad I made up my mind,” Chisholm said of the reunion of the group, which she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much."
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver with a Virgin Airlines special.
When they arrived at the airport, the army of nannies was waiting for them.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A gas price dispute is currently underway between Russia and Ukraine, increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is being closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it gets from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should no doubt be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a cut in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must check foreign workers'
The Comptroller said the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve criminal records checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate picture of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report highlighted that other key checks had been carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being linked to the bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to monitor criminal records, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which helps employers with inspections in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not conducted regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS was largely in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but added: “Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign staff.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value the comments will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had trouble identifying the staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures at NHS bodies in the Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian areas are largely being implemented.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and guidelines on pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I wanted to get this job done immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.
She added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, will consider the report’s recommendations and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment control directives for all staff – including foreign staff – that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division won the film awards.
Control, a biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.

Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting the British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for the iconic U2 cover of Joshua Tree, two awards – for Best Director and Best Debut Director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - as Julien Temple's film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the award for Best Actor for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.

Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the film star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me.”
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Biffs, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Proponents and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on an oil facility as well as the clerical and security forces.
State television said one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A television report said an eight-militant cell led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to defend the facility from a failed al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who had slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of clerics and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family, which controls the government.
The militants — backed by calls from al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government — have targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by security forces over the past... five months," an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was aimed at promoting "takfiri thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may be a glimpse into Earth's future
Scientists have announced that Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from an orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more like Earth’s headstrong twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the scorched greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotational speeds sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics and one of the Venus Express mission leaders, said: “It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began just like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police seize 'enriched uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched in uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still wide-eyed
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading for next year’s election.
It is not clear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most important Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something gratifying: The announcer recorded peaks of agreement when the candidates talked about hard-line approaches at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was poked ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, like the mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two fought particularly fiercely when they asked if any of the candidates would support an “amnesty” (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Side-candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
Neither has a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game, perhaps because they started sounding the alarm about immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: more strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other worries with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through it, Mr. Giuliani stumbled to the conclusion that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another inquirer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – who now, against all odds, is number one in a recent survey in Iowa due to his longstanding Christian conservatism – said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning himself a laugh.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent success in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheer during Wednesday's debate.
The two have bounced back from the bottom, as both wings of the party still can’t agree on better-known and more traditional candidates.
In the 1980s and 2000s, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with a victorious report of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of Labour
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is common in British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
It does not seem that any orders were sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers were sucked.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would do without discovering that some wealthy businessman had been masking the <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (US$1.3 million) contributions to the ruling Labour Party for four years under other people’s names, and that the party had not announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision had not been influenced by polls, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly humorous Liberal Democrat deputy chairman put it, the once-feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of troubled Northern Rock Bank showed weaknesses in management and weak judgment under fire.
The ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed an unimaginable administrative blunder.
The three retired generals launched a mutiny in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are multiple gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary-general (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably heading for his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governance difficult.
People don’t trust politicians and don’t like them, but they usually put aside their mistrust when a new gang takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not even be in office for long, this shift is over: the state administration is becoming leaky, ministers are starting to brief, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the tax office are linked to the decisions Mr. Brown made as finance minister.
And while he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s troubles, such as a lengthy investigation into the funding of political parties caused by “values for money,” voters can safely conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's difficulties are not as bad as they seem.
They’re not as bad as conservatives make them out to be.
As far as Mr Bean is concerned, no one has died or been outright deceived.
And the cure, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, solid, and lightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he didn’t want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not his.
Laws against the anonymity of major political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abrahams's conduct but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly interrogated; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour money-seeker who learned of the fraudulent gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown has been uninvolved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these intrigues, though the bulk of the payments were made after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws on his own part, but diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission of inquiry on the matter - led in addition by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complex.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
That would require Labour, who are in a tight spot, to co-operate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win is with unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally begin to quiver excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is in decline, the predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses from subprime mortgages could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
The number of cases of inability to repay (in case of more than 30-day delay in payment) and accounts written off (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable) is increasing.
HSBC said last month it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market — also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is still too early to panic.
Depreciated accounts and inability to repay are still few.
According to Moody’s, the third quarter’s default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that make up a large portion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers worsened.
The industry also shows a good level of maturity, which shows how much consumers pay back from their debts per month.
And trust in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread the infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when property loans dry up, consumers are more likely to be indebted via credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, tend to look at cash flow rather than the value of guaranteed items, so falling house prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be beneficial to lenders.
Consumers’ motivation to repay their mortgages falls when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risks of a rapid change in the prices of guarantee items.
“It’s not going to happen that one fine morning we just reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
While the risk of a subprime-style explosion is low, the risk of a gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British Bankers Plead Guilty in Enron Case
The three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud linked to former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, changed their statement on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud when they and Fastow were supposed to participate in a financial scam in 2000 -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers -- and denied the charges.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, featured on the front pages for two years, which lasted a publishing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation launched after the Enron crash in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr Fastow that he had been the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The indictment against the bankers -- who have earned the nickname "The NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot the scam with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in an Enron affiliate controlled by Fastow, the architect of many of the Enron scams that pushed Enron into a spiral of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch as zero, but our three Britons knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought the bank's stake in the branch for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others were fined $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were moving freely on $1 million bail, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country’s seventh-largest company, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting gimmicks made it impossible to hide billions of dollars of debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has eliminated thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s downfall.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient volume of fuel for a non-stop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $ 54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, these are small returns.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative for Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer sat at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of lavish consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their booths, hoping that the newly wealthy Russians would lure in everything from mahogany-lined yachts to diamond-decorated car partitions that not even 50 Cent would be ashamed of.
Mr. F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next stall.
"That's a nice car, but it's nickels and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
On the waves of oil, money pours into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became enormously wealthy and went to Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference brought together Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total wealth of $ 282 billion.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local major institute, has published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 “second-rate” millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $ 670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for London jeweller David Morris.
It was the first time she was at the fair, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are well-groomed, and all men are well-to-do."
As they walked around the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at these cars and I can’t decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who is dressed in designer clothes like a veteran of the red carpet, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a domestic doll.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the fresh rich, brand-controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to sit for several hours in road traffic, so that they can walk around the warehouse, which glaringly stirs Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick, billiard tables to measure, Dubai snooker tables to measure.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue tiles in a larger size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in gilding."
Indeed, local salesmen say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards, it is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from flashy logos to little-known limited-edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or ordinary tourists, flooded the exhibition halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere and cotton mattresses laced with gold threads for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car company, said he had sold three chain bracelet-style car grilles for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a string coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife from a cubic zirconium doesn’t have to ride those wheels yet,” Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll put them in his garage for 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not currently mean anything very exclusive, given the large increase in prices of local real estate.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a booth run by the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company has erected four red telephone booths of British style stuffed with a column of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake notes for the Millionaires Fair.
The passers-by stopped to squander money, or to have their friends take pictures of them resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply stuffed their pockets with a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a botched operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant A little healthier and watched an ambulance arrive at a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police car soon arrived.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment I knew someone was dead."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died because of the procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," Mr McCarthy said of Ms Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
It would protect me."
Mr McCarthy said Ms Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the Union District Attorney, Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from unlicensed surgery.
"It's an option," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
November, and they found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday, in Miss Castro's house, with a broken rose bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - was sitting in an open garage.
There were two mountain bikes hanging from the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived at the New York Police Department in Newark after 25 years, Miss Arroyo had provided him with invaluable assistance in sifting through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came in, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will reduce interest rates, leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
Share prices on both sides of the Atlantic soared yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve would try to calm down borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were bolstered by reassuring remarks from the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets have soared in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, said that in response to the continued pressure on financial markets, policymakers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid hints of a resurgent credit crunch, Mr Kohn said the recent upsurge "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets towards the end of September and in October".
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of worsening financial conditions for households and businesses will increase.
Investors see the comments as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver fresh capital injections to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid more bad news about the U.S. economy, when apartment sales in October hit record lows.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by Bear Stearns’ announcement that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost-cutting effort to offset the heavy losses caused by a failed bet on subprime housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index gained 2.65 percent.
London’s FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, the credit stress in the markets showed itself in full force after these funds were loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7% in the European Central Bank’s three-month money packages auction, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB to release above-standard money into London’s money markets has increased, with rates of three-month UK interbank loans “Libor” rising after uninterrupted growth since November 12 to their highest since the end of September – 6.59%.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on bats for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds the post at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with decision-making help, and because the table of Hugh Morris, the head manager of the English team, would be filled with applications.
He who is not placed sixth on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is demanding and requires an assessment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, isn't it?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or Tubby Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and a track record in the field, should be promoted to a commission - there's only room for one.
Who's to say which level is the right one for cricketers if they don't get a chance to sink or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, the cricketer must catch the captain’s eye at the right time to take the wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances in starting positions to make an impression as a day-long cricketer.
Capturing a collector's eye is more complicated.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same meager average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for another.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish the career of both, or also may not have much influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 allowed runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time was fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who in addition, although in Australia against Australia, still scored under 100 points.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful exuberance after one more discussion following today’s practice at Asirgiya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in first class speak for themselves, compared to six Bopars, who, at the age of twenty-two, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin-offs.
However, in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in Test at Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, Shah made only ten runs, and this, along with the immediate rejection of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to re-seed him for the next match, his firing seemed to have taken something out of Bohdana's mind.
In contrast, the Essex Universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket pitch, and his off-court behavior is symbolized by a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the showday of the English team’s automotive sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he pulled out was his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched from a distance, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed skidding on the local pitches that seem to suit him, he distributes effectively and launches confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which I do not want to say that Shah will not excel if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it will be he who will play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dumping refugees who ran out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city was returning to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already there before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the mainly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariya called him saying that the local militia, backed by the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is a leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, several friends called me and told me that they were running an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikhu and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many talked about the appeal of calming down in the capital after the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local “groups of interested citizens” who defend their neighborhoods with a weapon in hand alongside the US military.
But there was more talk that they were driven back by visa obstructions and a drop in money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among the refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
“Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis visas so they could go back to Iraq,” he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of the violence is the fact that the Sunnis were pushed out of the Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees is once again stoking sectarian tensions and leading to more fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
Germany’s smallest state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even with the international focus of its universities.
In only one area of education is Saarland concerned by the same lack as the rest of Germany.
“To a person who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French” – this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is in the fifth place in the monitoring of the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Colleges have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Saar children is admitted to higher education - many of them even without studying at a gymnasium.
“The Saarland has a professional education system,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, IW’s education expert.
With more than one in five young people eligible to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland has a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two fields are, given the population, the second best in the whole of Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering fields.
"After Pisa's first study, we have made several reforms in general education schools," a spokesman for the education ministry said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal states are also taking over.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will be shown.
When the Pisa study was conducted in 2003, the proportion of high-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
In general, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of the Saarland, Pisa’s studies do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages – otherwise Saarland could score in this area.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory in grammar schools - although the inhabitants of the Saarland are not French.
Chavez moves the clock
The hours in Venezuela will soon be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will allow the clock to be moved back half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that under the new law, the clock will move by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States forced the world to divide the time zones for hours.
On Wednesday, Chávez announced that he was severing ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist has said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-respect anymore," said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the people of the oil-rich country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia to release the hostages.
Uribe's decision "spitted in the face" of Venezuela, he criticized Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile ringtone caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" (Why are you not quiet anymore?) - this is the sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was voiced by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so enraged by the left-wing populist’s loud remarks that he silenced him in this way.
German workers at risk of lower pay in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of a reduction in real wages this year, despite a strong boom.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, in 2007, employed people can realistically count on receiving a lower salary than last year.
"A small increase in wages, an increase in value-added tax and an increase in food and energy prices are to blame," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Konjunkturforschung (IMK) told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also await in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the newspaper Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% by the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the federal labour agency should not again fall into such difficulties that it has to demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspaper of this socially democratic politician quoted.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the price explosion of food and oil products drove inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by three percent.
Venus is Earth’s twin infernal.
Venus Express, the European spacecraft on Venus, has recorded phenomena that also occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and winds whirl at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is glowing.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific journal Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the formation of primordial matter, lightning was able to give rise to life on Earth. Storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
“If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than that of Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but he's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, began to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the ESA mission.
Since no spacecraft has been sent to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of the research, which brought closer several articles of the journal Nature, not only emphasized the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind vortices at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as Jit<0xC5><0x99>enka or Ve<0xC4><0x8D>ernice, will orbit the Sun in about 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus has a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them, but it remained in the oceans on Earth, while it evaporated into space from Venus.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is calling for an end to party disputes over the Dalai Lama's acceptance into the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler worries about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not outwardly present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but this did not prevent him from standing up to Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
“The chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the Dalai Lama’s acceptance, and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the “pretentious” foreign policy of the coalition.
After the admission of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of similar unrest in France
Street battles with the police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not grow into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
The barricades were on fire, rioters fired shotguns at the police. After serious riots of minors in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create in our country such social tension that breaks out in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Hanoverian newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to fix the problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the conference on Islam, we have seen first-hand success."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past nights, teenagers and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been engaged in violent street fighting.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "simulation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be acted upon.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average".
In particular, more study opportunities need to be provided.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give young people hope."
The head of the Turkish municipality, however, added that in Germany, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "Nevertheless, we must be careful."
We need to “quickly allow adolescents to start working and learning.”
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burning garbage cans and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 peacekeepers have been deployed.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse riots broke out.
The riots were sparked by a Sunday traffic accident in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of minors.
In the realm of Angela "Clouds"
The Chancellor’s reality-distant output documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
What country does the Chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, govern.
Angela Merkel responded to the reproach of focusing too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, showing she doesn’t want to understand what critics are up to.
In the Bundestag, she made it clear to everyone how much she deserved the blame.
There was no real interest from Merkel, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who excels above others, who flees into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer tells how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
In general, such self-praise - so much immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU chairwoman two years ago.
Now she limits herself to wild phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, she damages her image as a pragmatist who does not need to be flattered, because she solves problems.
But in Angela's realm, the "Clouds" are a fringe issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage people?
There are still a few words left for her on these issues.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is arguing when it comes to child benefits.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times in order to be able to say at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things get too specific, it stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has been heated in the case of Rudy Giuliani’s and Mitt Romney’s favourites – and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his rival Rudy Guiliani of making New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp reproaches: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, reprimanding the former governor of Massachusetts for privately employing undocumented immigrants.
As the Republican base has yet to have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos shot by Internet users and sent via YouTube serve only as such help for a key topic.
"It is precisely this policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain told his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one pushing for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
A Vietnam veteran, McCain, has not spared Romney, either, for refusing to condemn the torturous method of interrogation called “Waterboarding,” which simulates heating.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The public bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, asking the party's base and television audience for forgiveness for his advocacy of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian life
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief, Pakistan’s Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Parviz Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday and will serve another five years in office.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and to pursue the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as commander-in-chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, particularly from the US.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the Western demands.
The country’s highest court, which handed Musharraf a state of emergency in early November, overturned all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal region, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock Fathers are back
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia band grabbed their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three sedentary gentlemen who at first look like they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Thirty-six-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar.
The 37-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who bends over the synthesizers, is on the right from the audience’s point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by mistake, a traditional song is created.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians very much.
Among the lovers of krautrock, the revival of the band Harmony caused a considerable stir.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so cunning that this band was painfully lacking for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t a German also celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when he values the musical style, mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the Echo Prize for Lifetime Achievement to the surviving members of the Cologne-based group Can, the hall was full of questioning views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the audience’s amazement no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother would later sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmony unnecessarily overloads the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne Theater in Berlin.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-run record company.
Rother briefly worked for Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist for Neu!, perhaps Germany's most radical band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to labor as a nanny.
It was more like living in such a Spitzwegian artistic existence.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a garbage can.
Much of this has been preserved by Harmony.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financially.
Collecting groves served not only self-knowledge.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was edited during a concert in Griessem in front of a record-low, barely 50-piece backdrop.
At the time, Rothera expressed a wish that the members of Harmonia would avoid and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebia, it was a completely rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their split.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster came back to life in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmony ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nland set out to preserve the Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
Harmony’s physical resurrection will take place at Berlin’s House of World Cultures.
Performances at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Love Parade founder Dr. Motte will also be attending.
In this way, we have outlined the overall extent of the impact of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Ena, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are paintings in which the producer with Harmony is in a peasant session.
Also contributing to the creation of the legend is the projection of other black-and-white photos, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
No longer by gluing microphones to organs and drums to extract those never-before-heard self-made tones from instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technique of immersion punters.
Nor does the House of World Cultures.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, emphatically sings "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find our roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escaping from artistic and social conventions (Cluster) rather than in the blues.
The one who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not be disturbed even now.
Even the most obvious thing is to think carefully on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question will either rob a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
With the release of the films The Hunting Party and M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The pattern of the films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can’t stop this from happening in The Hunting Party.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we’ve lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he’s starred in so many delightful, frivolous roles in cool women’s films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, a man’s appetite for another film with this actor is taken away.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party – Where the Hunter Becomes the Hunted (Why do the movie titles have to be so long and tangled these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially what Gere would have become if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man whose best years are long behind him, but who, like a ruinous monument, still retains some remarkable charm.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden, which is also entering cinemas this week, is only the continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is laudable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this TV-savvy film turns into shooting and action too soon.
The film will leave something very similar to the series Kobra 11, without a highway, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, you can clearly explore why a really good film about the Balkan War has not been made yet.
The story of three American war reporters who claim to be the "extra", the Serbian supreme war criminal, could at another time and under the leadership of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard) may become the new "Apocalypse".
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the depraved and sentimental cynic introduced at the outset.
On the contrary, the draft will prescribe him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after the reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film succeed in what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: capture the criminal and leave him for the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a deeply human message.
It denounces that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing persecution intensely enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar, we think of Brecht’s famous poem.
It is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, scarred: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are just such swollen heads, which, however, indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the topic of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were big failures.
One thing can be added to this: No good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
Almost always: When a star wanders through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Breaking Point with Angelina Jolie, or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film – Schindler’s List.
Many films must apparently mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "Lead Vest" - were in no way celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Scriptwriters don’t have the ability to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” had become so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how horribly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to form a sarcastic artistic outlook as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the "Balkan War", he said: "The only way to see it is that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust receives criticism for renouncing the Olympics
The mayor’s withdrawal from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has met with fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of water games.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "unfortunate from the point of view of business".
No other project in recent times has awakened such a great motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, it would not have been possible to keep this sporting and political enthusiasm at such a high level.
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic bid," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Association will decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference for us means that with a 2028 timeline, we don’t have a realistic chance.”
Yet this dream is not yet over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to apply for the organization of the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to destroy our chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage," HSB president G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Refusing to apply would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the Universiade in 2015 as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
The higher education sports association Hamburg only last week nominated the candidate city.
A faction of the SPD in the Hamburg Senate said it was wasting valuable time building apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on the organization of the Olympics and has ruled out the construction of apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area later being used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg generated great enthusiasm at the time.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
Most of his list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Warhol's "Brillo boxes" of 1968, comes the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo boxes" that in 1995 the Museum of Moderna Museet's director had given a gift to him.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-blue design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their designs, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 for several wooden Brillo boxes to be made in Sweden, but they are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time now speak of fifteen boxes, which at that time rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Typ Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the museum’s legendary director, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that approximately one hundred boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were made in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for the St. Petersburg exhibition only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol was already three years dead.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, examined, in addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood boards were painted with base paint and sanded.
From the structure of the copies from 1990, on the contrary, it turned out that the paint was applied directly to the plywood plate without any previous primer paint - besides, it is an acrylic and not an oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official list of Brillo boxes," Moderna Museet's director, Lars Nittve, said: "If Andy Warhol's Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to copy six boxes from its exhibition collections as a collection of classics."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into these “core allegations” raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But the organization is still in inexorable silence.
Rebels in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered after they entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for foiling an attempted coup in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the meeting to escape with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government loyalist units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
'People have had enough, 'said Trialnes.
“We encourage people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government have called for a large demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been accused of corruption for months.
Manila’s financial district had already become the main scene of a 200-strong rebellion against Arroyo in 2003.
Since the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet Becomes Versatel’s Majority Shareholder
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in Versatel, a telecommunications company.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
Previously, there had been speculation of a takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is taking this step to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-based network operator by a further 5 % to 15.1%, there was speculation of entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet held a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold an additional 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman said.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies together set up a joint venture SME.
United Internet announced on Thursday that the two companies would settle for more than 10 percent in Freenet and would not use their right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of the business.
For the time being, it is considered that the companies are keeping all options open, in particular the possibility of further increasing their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet regarding the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This month-long and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million full or DSL customers.
United Internet and Drillische held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would receive approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
