Welsh MPs worry they will look like Muppets
Some Members of Parliament (AM) were appalled by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to change the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentarians from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means "dumb" and pwp means "stupid".
A Welsh MP, Plaid Cymru, said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to a name change, but that MWP in speech could quickly turn into a Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee currently preparing the law for the introduction of the name change announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary deputies will be titled will be on themselves."
A 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that have found broad support for changing the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what MPs will be called in Parliament, the Committee was apt to be called "members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Parliamentarians are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on changes within weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way parliament functions, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary deputies and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians to hold referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed launching the process of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are still ringing as churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
“Older people I talked to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“There’s no one else today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People today are socializing in a different way," he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of neighborhoods where people regularly reside.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as church leaders think and “sooner or later it will be found again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so the day will come sooner when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held worship services nearby took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor people.”
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: “cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing on a larger carillon in Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What takes place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "try to shift costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old During Lobster Diving in California
According to an official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s call for help and then rowed with the group to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
"I said, 'There's a shark in the water,'" Hammel said.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team, Larry Giles, told a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto beach in Casablado to Swami in Ecinitas to investigate and ensure the safety of swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing store-style beauty counters and hiring specialist retailers.
As part of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn UK beauty market’s major entry, which continues to grow alongside the drop in sales of clothing and home furnishings, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in beauty products is one way supermarkets are looking to take advantage of the shelf space that was once envisioned for TVs, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
At the same time, the supermarket is relaunching its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
Fragrance Shop will also be trialling concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online shopping and the return to day-to-day buying of small amounts of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles to resist favorable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because it bought both chains two years ago, which it claims has spurred food sales and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to refresh their cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business at 281 Celsius, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
He says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetic departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We also invested in a special training of colleagues who will be on hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
‘Dragon’s’ star Dan Peter Jones left to ‘cook with rage’ after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his brand to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of homewear and Truly fashion accessories.
Their brand was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon’s star Dan Peter Jones to cook with anger by pulling out of a lucrative joint venture at the last minute to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when the television’s golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant there was no longer enough time to devote to their homewear and fashion accessories brand Truly.
The deal was compared to Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s biggest priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
There's a warehouse at Marlow that's full of merchandise that's ready to be sold."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the show host This Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of dollars in losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes and possible additional delay in starting the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's show I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in newspapers for comments that some might consider “unworthy of a president” and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
Trump said, mimicking the voice of a news anchor.
"I made no concessions."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed a “appropriate reaction” by the United States to North Korea’s disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the US has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump, in his speech at the rally, took a much more optimistic stance.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results — halting missile test launches, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena to enter, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it’s all a bit problematic,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
Given the constant shaking of the soil in Indonesia, this country remains woefully unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common on other parts of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even at the best of times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to take care of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's crumbling structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yokohama is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are being held next year.
Yoko is also facing pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal for the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in a Premier League game against Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goal in a 1–0 draw for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left leg before kicking it into the opposite stance.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped to Kepai Arrizabalaga, who jumped towards it and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn’t think too much about it and I just fired.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that game before turning around somewhere in the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
He then directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball into the net with his left foot on the opposite tripod next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome Videoton to the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster office said early Sunday.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake felt on Friday that caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is filled with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after the woman was fatally stabbed.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people from the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived on the scene who believe they know this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is under way, and police said they are also in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
The taxi driver, who lives on Grayson Mews, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants were now told it would take several hours before they could return to their apartments.
A police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
Anyone with any information was asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to minutes 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s statue in Parliament is the latest monument to find itself in the middle of a debate about “remaking history”
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s society called Mr. Crick’s attempt “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently underway over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century way of thinking and part of the historiography of a person whom many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure representing one side of that divide.
"His achievements as Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honor and celebration."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man with only the last name “Yuan” was found dead with his arteries cut and covered in blood near a stall at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xinging, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound pig bit the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news said a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje Novosti that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her wife on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're nibbling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it crosses the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding rains in the areas of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 05:00 Eastern time, Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure is forming over the Pacific and moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, she will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure area will cause the formation of strong precipitation in a large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential floods, muddy torrents and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Torrential flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to go to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local stormy winds and dust storms.
Approaching low-pressure areas will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
Precipitation in the amount of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less muddy torrents and slippery roads.
It will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning before covering the wider area at the end of the day on Monday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area where the Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah state borders touch on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, early October is expected to be warm at 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political showdown continued, with reporters interrupting the regular program to announce the reversal at the last minute of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number cited in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better idea, this is an audience that is similar in number to the one watching the playoffs of American football or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest viewership at an average of 5.69 million during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that unfolded on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
For a few minutes, he stood staring down as protesters hurled insults at him in front of CNN cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement even before the elevator doors closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were watching live when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on sending Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate over the next week, as demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the UK’s future and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan in another interview in the same issue with her on the cover, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties was “total nonsense”.
Wayde Sims' murder: police arrest Dytheon Simpson suspected of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the clash.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A bail of $350,000 was requested.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for "perseverance and the search for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 183-cm-high winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash into Mexico City
The ash ejected by the Popocatápetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple rumbles and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity from the volcano, 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and after thousands joined counter-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists prevented by riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint at police officers, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise have been flooded with tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day when police used batons to calm the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" and, in contrast, unionists chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local press reported.
Tensions in the independence-seeking region have not abated for a year since the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has declared illegal and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence, although turnout was low because those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations continued, but protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a crucial, albeit narrow, victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalan independence parties are struggling to maintain momentum this year as their best-known leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have announced to an investigative prison since the end of last year that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly ramming their car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow from a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menge's goal brought Livingston victory over the Rangers with a result of 1: 0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston was a win.
The new Scottish Premier League club, Livingston, surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to concede his only second loss of 18 games at Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge’s goal proved decisive as Gary Holt’s team settled with an Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team remains unbeaten in the Premier League this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the league's leading club with eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna club as part of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his win streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against the dead guests
Holt's team should have led before they scored, as their directness in the attack caused a whole host of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head shot towards the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for the guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free-kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi, who scored in the middle of the goal.
By this point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Ranger Allan McGregor's legs were cut off by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow delivered a broad blow from another organized attack by Livingston.
The long passes failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two elevens were not awarded – after Halkett's clash with substitute player Glen Middleton and one for playing by hand.
“Great” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena in Scotland
It's a great game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, which continued to exceed expectations on that inbound route.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but a big credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a breather throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They only opened a hole in the home team once and that's kind of an invitation to kick for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
It has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of the president's supporters came to see him.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurds — have raised their voices by condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The clashing demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and attacked as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Road Crash: Bicyclist Killed in Car Crash
The cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a high-traffic road in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed after a collision and the driver fled from the crash site at Chiders Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The city police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Roads were closed and bus traffic diverted due to the accident, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in the unrest in the men's prison of the imprisoned type.
Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" units were brought in to quell unrest involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers were provided with assistance on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of staff received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they could spend a long time behind bars.”
Long Lartin Prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had ended up in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to the prison to solve a serious situation in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (possible benefit for arid areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa crosses the Desert Southwest with the remaining force and brings the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late on Monday with rain and cross straight over on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm at the Mogollonian edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Rockies and the Great Basin, there is a probability of precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total amounts of up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from torrential flooding, Rosa could come as a rescue as the region is hit by a drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these precipitations could be useful because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Dryland Map, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
The hurricane's trajectory first approached the coast along Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane strength with a maximum wind speed of 130km/h and was 620km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20km/h.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and weakened it.
It is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora ranges from 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in the Baja California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
At about 04.00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said the 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police have called in anyone with a video of the incident.
Trump Claims Kavanaugh Suffered From Democratic Party Anger
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s cruel and shameful tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and decisively and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the accusation she made.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans going to the polls in the middle of the presidential term.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
"I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican aide told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds Dead in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami, Numbers Still Rising
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them by the huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters hit the shore at dusk, dragging many of them to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't run right away and they were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area home to 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake matched the 200 times power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He also said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are believed to be missing.
According to Nugroh, the death toll and damage may be higher along the coast 300km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake's epicenter.
“Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal.”
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning people down the street of the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The military said it had begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still needed food and other supplies.
The city's airport is again open for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggala have successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where employees have been sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they have passed on scenes of destruction along the way,” Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and engagement of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can receive international assistance, but such a state of affairs has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Friday, friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigated the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
“Given the many years I’ve spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, which had spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray check mark instead of two blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 during ATM charging at Newport on the Levee center
Thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brinko's who was filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee center on Friday morning, the Newport Police Department said in a statement.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, another man “came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not give the number of people involved.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "The living entity will be officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said in an interview with radio host Big Boy earlier this year.
“So I am you, I am we, that’s us.
It started with Kanya, which means “the only one,” in Ye alone – it’s a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of a string of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, Jay-Z, toyed with versions of his name without a hyphen and with a hyphen and written in capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against Mexican citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed in Tlatelolco Square on Saturday that he would "never use the military against the Mexican people."
Troops fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in AI research,” said Kai Fu Leeu, an AI investor and expert in the field who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy in principle.
Last year, China unveiled its plan to become the world’s first AI innovation country by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
“A doubling of investment could double the chances of the next big AI achievement in the U.S.,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, “AI Powers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American game player Othello, and later was director of Microsoft’s research department and president of Google’s Chinese arm.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It is not China that is taking away academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI research in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
China’s State Council announced its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece over which Greece has blocked the opening of accession negotiations with the European Union and NATO.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia, and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name represents its own territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership while accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the post-Yugoslav countries, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko joined a referendum on the change of the country's name in Strumica on September 30, 2018, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and held up chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integrations."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "positive" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 percent and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, below the required turnout.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton's entire defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at Manchester's Etihad Stadium on Saturday to a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero made the win insanely easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defence players and then made it to the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to Sterling's left.
The English striker on the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera, who threw the right-handed football into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re happy he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that game, Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's court.
He added the ball to Leroy Sane along his left flank.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before leading Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' promotion
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a new start.
But the competitive Scherzer always hopes for Sunday's win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make it to the playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still hope to win their first title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would be playing at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals still have to announce Sunday's starter, but are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer a chance to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher's area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-winger from Washington this season scored 18: 7, the average of won runs (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds shifts.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, the president made a twisting comment on his election of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's five weeks until one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere, to fight for great candidates.”
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
Their intention is to take back power in any way; you see evil, depravity.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control.
Democrats, he says, have a mission to "resist and disrupt".
“You’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee after him, which caused a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer holds different views.
He does not tolerate the making of personal statements.
I wasn’t too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome – all because we have said what is on our mind.
According to my deputy, Joan Ryan, they behaved similarly because they strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been working as a local Labour MP, the Friday evening meetings of the General Council were just that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings take a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as associates I thought we shared similar political opinions began to demand of me a drastic change of mind and taking positions I would otherwise never agree with – be it on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a flood of offensive words on social media calling for my impeachment, rejecting the policies of the centre and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the toleration of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every no-confidence motion or change in electoral rules, we are becoming an increasingly narrow-minded party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and told that then everything would be fine."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred on by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government that left my multi-purpose classroom to rot, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who backed the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is gripping towards Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of impeachment or political gain will deter me from acting in the way I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat influenced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tennent's Premier League.
They have now reached the top of the standings and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Thanks to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt by Frazier Climo brought Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with an eleven-pointer before scoring a goal at the half and making an independent attempt to change the score for Ayr to 17:5 ahead of a break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot realized, reduced the lead to five points.
Then came a long pause due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott who was taken away on a stretcher, and when the game continued, Ayr continued the good game with an attempt by Stafford McDowall to realize Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, with Bruce Colvine's unfulfilled attempt at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to knock down a Clima who didn't have the ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson made a lay behind Ayr in a full swing breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the domestic team.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to resume work in the service industries after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series, which he co-wrote with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and Kiernan appears to be planning to dedicate himself to life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, hopes the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a naval center filled with cranes in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean is hung on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring him back."
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost seashore in favor of Chile during the resource conflicts of the 19th century is still alive – just as the longing for the Pacific re-navigation is alive.
As Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on Oct. 1, after a five-year trial, those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course is optimistic about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Crowds of Bolivians across the country will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens and hope that a court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the surrender of a sovereign outlet to the Bolivian sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, could also benefit from Monday's verdict.
“We are on the verge of bringing back the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor, and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have put them back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership,” Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has buried all the good will of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia an “unusual opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to get through the past.”
North Korea says it won't achieve nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a meeting between the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
He made the comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said the sanctions continued because of "empty imaginings" and that U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to back the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal The Last Line Of Big Headwear Is On The Way To A Luxury Store In Your Neighborhood
Whether you want to enhance your hat collection or completely shade the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a line of freaky huge headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection on the runway and delighted fans of style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the runway.
Valentino designed the model, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like perimeter that completely "takes over" the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories aren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than pieces of haute couture.
One of the creations resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly along the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of approximately 60 cm, which has been seen on many celebrities, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered social media sent another great creation to the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The faded orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia tassels and a white leather handle, was an exhibit in Jacques' La Riviera's summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity and celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The language skills that the world's citizens need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, with added weight given to individual and joint achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the aforementioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest marks in languages were achieved by participants of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent grade in Mandarin, while 72% of students who learn German, 69% of students who learn French and 63% of students who learn Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of language skills workforce.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks several languages can communicate directly with foreigners, and this gives him an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, 15% to be exact.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will opt for languages considered to be most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are proficient in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which learning will prepare and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
One cannot ignore the fact that in today's global business world, language skills are very important for the future of every country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers is expected soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting his campaign with a number of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned gatherings that Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has yet to cast his vote for a new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as Republicans risk losing their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate confirmation decision has been pending for a week until the FBI's investigation is complete.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain the upper hand in the November election.
The Trump campaign said the five rallies scheduled for next week were aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“A majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we embark on a tumultuous campaign,” an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. In that state, he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve his poll rank," political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team left their hearts in the field before the individual clashes on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Sunday afternoon's pairing may be exactly what was supposed to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"The wheel of fortune turns" is a saying that is especially true in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions such as this.
To whom is the wheel of fortune now favoured?
“They had six points advantage, and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans have a four-point lead, with 12 points remaining until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a bit of wind in their backs and encouragement from his pairing with Justin Thomas, with whom he scored three out of four points after a full day of play.
Spieth has played murderously from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
Cheerful cheers grew louder as Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, culminating in the crucial road that Spieth took to the draw.
After the road that won the game with 15 holes, there was a similar cheering howl in which one can recognize hope and faith that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just have to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a Ryder Cup sensation.
European strange, but irresistible pair has the maximum number of points and can not go wrong.
Moliwood is the only pair not to have lost a point on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly nailed Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's doubles game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the field buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, on Sunday there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It’s fascinating to watch the games of couples up close because you can see the interactions of the players in a pair, hear the tips they give and the ones they don’t, as well as study the strategy that can change in a moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and they have come in with a significant advantage in the last day, but this game in pairs also showed that the US team has the necessary combativeness, which some, especially the Stateside, doubted.
Europeans in the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10: 6.
Dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in an effort to win the trophy that eluded them at Hazeltine two years ago was more dominant than the American team in the morning's doubles games, scoring 3-1.
The American team showed greater combativeness in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the trophy, the Jim Furyk team needs to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debutant from the European team to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as “Molliwood”, after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in a doubles game in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5 & 4 victory.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourballs and doubles and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused his morning fourballs to get back in the game with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third-best player.
But Europeans didn’t do so well on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the bar high for their American team.
They first defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in doubles after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team that was four points behind managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days behind schedule, it looks like the Sunday counterattack is going to be hard for them to fall.
North Korea says ‘no chance’ of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust of the United States and there was no chance that North Korea would unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will," such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear testing station and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
“However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States,” he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security either. Under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has made it conditional on Pyongyang giving up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization be carried out first and increases the pressure through sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri added.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister noted that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had asked for denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a halt.”
Whatever the case, Rio’s tone was very different from last year when he addressed the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a “man-made missile” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year at the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday there was no timeline for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must strictly continue until there is complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him "gangster demands" hours later.
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these “appropriate measures” related to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course that teaches how to have a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has allowed all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of learning alongside caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academician found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed what he believes is the first course of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did I only find out this now, in my senior year of college?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after students were found to have a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive assignments.
One of these tasks involves a picture of a student dormitory where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important the sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus with interactive icons is displayed, which encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know, how cigarettes affect health,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against weight gain, because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of starvation and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all graduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard’s boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's goal toppled Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with Livingston's 1–0 win.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first away win after a 4–1 triumph in February at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now eight points behind the leading Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half, and the Rangers seemed to be left without inspiration and did not seem to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one goal difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight substitutions on the flanks, pushing past Ayre to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston line-up that weighed in on the Hearts last week and would have been thrilled that his well-crafted line-up stifled any attempt by an opponent.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston scored more with it.
They had a chance to score just two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game, which opened the way for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise kick to the back rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have awarded him the penalty kick in the 15th minute after his clash with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not heed Columbian's request.
The Rangers were only able to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly received one head-butt from Lassana Coulibaly and a tame shot from Ovie Ejari.
Although Livingston's 34-minute playoff run slowed the game, no one can deny the effort.
The Rangers once again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep rebound.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Menga for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The substitution almost had an immediate effect because the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long shot at a time.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide inflection from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an eleven because he tripped over Jacobs, but this time Thomson took a backseat.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now follows a page from our Almanac on the Sunday Morning show: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago ...the birth day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention a device known as the Geiger counter was later developed.
The mainstay of science since that time, the Geiger counter has also become the mainstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado" in which the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the main roles:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Look at that, you can hear it!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ bad cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Bad Cells and Destroy Them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
The cells are treated to “recognise” a protein common to many types of cancer and then re-injected into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing the immune system cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to recognize a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune system cells from a patient and “learning” how to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, got involved in discussions about Trump and backed him up, wearing a cap that read “Make America Great Again.”
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-up performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of an evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap that read “Make America Great Again,” he went on to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual misconduct.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's speech on social networks was broadcast by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock tried to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had been tipped off behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“I’ve been harassed behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been harassed!
They said I sank," the Washington Examiner reported.
West went on, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he was going to put on his Superman cape because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety reported that his comments at least twice drew public outcry, with members of the Saturday Night Live show feeling embarrassed, while one person told Variety: "The whole studio has shut down."
West was called in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I love it", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, stunned many.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the people with the bravest spirit: THANK YOU for standing up to the MAFIA.”
The show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was “just being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music, their clothes, or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "going to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow wielding a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, took issue with the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such television roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to win respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, admitted that he wanted to “very strongly” face this problem.
“Personally, I feel very determined at this point – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, compared to the problem we now see?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these particular traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something went wrong for the boys.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming Game of Thrones sequels after it ended next summer, and said he had "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard’s True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming that show, which gave me a family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that people infected with HIV in this way are almost non-existent.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country, 70–90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to tackle the problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' information, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles assures that these claims are spread by individuals of the “ultra-right wing”, as well as websites.
“Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked data reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unidentified Capitol Hill person during a Senate committee hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address revealing the source of the disclosures belonged to MP Waters’ office, as well as information about the MP’s staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for the leak of that data.
These unsubstantiated claims are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters’ statement quickly drew critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do can't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He's not allowed to question the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Barbara Walters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also took to Twitter.
"It matters if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had notified the “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies” of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear the legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Movie Review: Johnny English: Back on Task by Rowan Atkinson
It is now commonplace in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems to be so in the new adaptation of the action series Johnny English, whose first sequel, Johnny English, was first released in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title Johnny English Rides Again.
Will a twisted satire of our own about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyes out and his rubber face once again has permission to complicate the situation, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a cranky secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr Bean's character, and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one of the opening notes of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials and is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when a propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but his humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Missions Impossible" themselves offer elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English’s crazy stories are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s silent gags embodied in the character of Mr Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's most secret web of spies and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the dismay of the agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a unfortunately brief appearance.
This has spilled a glass of the prime minister’s patience, haughty and bellicose character who is experiencing a complete collapse of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully portray the character who is supposed to represent Theresa May, but she has not exactly received the material with which to do something.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And that person will be the careless Johnny English with his head and beard who is currently employed as the headmaster of a fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome geeks here because English teaches rocker-style spying.
English is quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he reunites with Bough, his former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the over-enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely lost.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service, who are doing everything completely wrong, return to the action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and ridiculous coincidences: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause a huge mess by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headsets to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything was done properly for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and flamboyant the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with the other Johnny English films, I again wondered if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that matched his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected a plan to make Britons work four days a week and get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan to make Britons work four days a week and get paid for five days’ work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be "integrated" into the party's economic agenda and plans to favor the country's workers' interests.
The trade union congress backed the shift to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day work week will not happen overnight, but it represents a tendency that fits in with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to lend its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this aspiration.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to seize power from “impersonal executives” and “profitors” in utility companies.
The chancellor's shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water utilities may not be able to recover their entire stake because the Labour government could make "deductions" based on the irregularities seen.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 per cent of private company capital to employees, who would earn an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court bid by at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency’s conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility the FBI might discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegations were made, and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, unflinching, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved into the stone.
“I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it would really take a strong accusation to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making phone calls, or any other meaningful means of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clictivism” – where people feel that signing an online petition or tweeting really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters that sought to achieve a range of different goals.
He said the actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would lead to more than $37 billion in spending that would impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, at least $10 billion of which has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers in the United Kingdom that advocates for “helping children develop to their full potential”, with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, it will provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the area.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, to an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website that reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It’s going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we’re going to fail.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy as ‘Blockade’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria "especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government" is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But, in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure that shipping lanes are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the nonprofit Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself in the U.S. as the “voice of the energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, and for Russia he says it "serves the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as the Trump administration’s intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a face-to-face meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the helm,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is going in the wrong direction."
“I am terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Gov. Devall Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of the vote for a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats discussed in connection with the 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after his return, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "general problem" that her son and other war veterans were silent about, saying they were "coming back a little different, coming back hardened, coming back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military, have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing domestic violence reporting, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Department.
18 U.S. states and D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys general who backed Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries facing pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Board to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be settled on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court friend’s report said.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems <0xCC><0xB6> not even all the serious problems <0xCC><0xB6> that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was more difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, were resting in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continued strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall,” Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ through ‘propaganda ads’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement of the China Daily newspaper in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a statement to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
“On the contrary, at a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s unsettling economic trajectory because the media is under firm pressure from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "some of China's most prominent newspapers have declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's election debacle has driven Republicans away ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
Emotions surrounding the event were high, and most Republicans have already shown they still want to cast their vote.
Such things cannot be returned,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, said in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) latest insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it tomorrow, nor in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectation,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news outlet.
“People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among suburban women and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by a Supreme Court justice candidate, analysts suggest there could be a backlash if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, it’s also about how Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, said in a statement.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony to be true, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and the people who will be allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it’s up to who can access which information in full to the user.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes, and the right skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several engineers who have signed a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they will introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Order of the First World War Priest with the Victoria Cross
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the highest British military honor.
The memorial was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's venture for which he received the accolade.
According to a report in the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
He later rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the unit forward before rushing unaided onto a Polish cannon and mutilating three of the detachment.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve that excites humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be taking part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches to end up being prevented from following the main event.
The San Jose-based program featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they aired live on Channel 5 at night.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast was interrupted by Peppa Pig.
Many were not at all impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the morning just for the sake of the fight.
One fan of the children’s cartoon cut-off on Twitter described it as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Whoops, Peppa Pig."
Bellator president Scott Coker said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about reruns, I think we can probably work something out,” Coker said.
“But the broadcast is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday comes to us, when it will already be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there was a lot of correspondence going around that wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. lt's a national problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of the six we normally do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate circumstance."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to others because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he started high school, he was not aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics was less important to him since becoming a father.
Regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a renegade on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference from the others were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “someone or something” so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he believed he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years his senior last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re so young you go through so much,” he recalled his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “he said it’s hard to find someone the same age and he’s experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he breathed out, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“All I knew was that what I’ve dreamed of all my life, jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song <0xCC><0xB6> "Proud" by the singer Heather Small <0xCC><0xB6> , which echoed in him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and to which he is always fond of .
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of form on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to fully recover to avoid an inconvenient turning point.
Mickelson, who is playing for a record twelfth time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-four games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working out his game on the training ground in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding terrain of Le Golf National, where a long uneven field routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man more than that and he couldn't say.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined there would be more of them, but that's how it turned out, and that's how we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else.
Mickelson is set to surpass Nick Fald's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence also brought some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for that,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s a lot more than a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0xB6> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You are constantly reminded that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team that won the 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 result on Friday and led the 10 <0xCC><0xB6> Le Golf yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll be playing at full power tomorrow.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floorboards sound.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
All the time I’m talking, I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who’s standing in front of us, the biggest players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about his players’ performance on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of an ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main singles, and that's something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re there as an individual, it’s the ultimate test of your golfer skills.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to do their best.
Now leave your team-mate because he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those major turning points on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser after Europe performed the “Miracle of Medina”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, a captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
Accordingly, we organized our line-up and set up the guys as if, you know, we were going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys goes in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
German new warship put on hold again
Germany’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrisome problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to their home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to show power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render a warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project <0xCC><0xB6> including crew training <0xCC><0xB6> also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually “running out of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said the problem has increased over time as old ships have been decommissioned and there have been no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Endowment eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), will follow common and marshy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile inspections using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the shots will determine the voting frequency of the bats and what kind does.
Then a habitat map and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and landscaping works that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks of pets cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Three estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal area for them.
“We have a huge space for bats here in Threat,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the representative for Scotland of the Bat Protection Association, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their populations are progressing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was the "good guy" who had been let down by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple had had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to void the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a move worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will ‘forever regret’ losing carmakers
The UK will “repent forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience production shutdowns at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal because of the possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border break that the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more inventory at its Derbyshire plant than it needs in a day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to come to an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say for how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election meddling, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has been stirring up rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the allegations.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week considering everything else that’s going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to aversion to the "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, though she said: "I won't stand up to the fact that they're flaunting themselves."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is organizing more meetings to answer questions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've analyzed the numbers."
Short speeches will continue to happen, Sanders said, but “if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
“We try to make that happen often, and you’ve seen it in the last few weeks, and it’s just that being able to talk to the president of the United States is going to replace a brief press conference.”
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Health Minister has sent a letter to EU staff at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you very much to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineman Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's loss to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31 <0xCC><0xB6> 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the playground line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on stretchers and sending him for further tests.
A representative from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris said there were "no details about the nature/scope of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five tackles before retiring from the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles in a season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Under the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
An increase in the tax will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK, and additional money will contribute to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current fee, including an increase introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for rent, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who are not resident in the UK, raising prices and making it harder for buyers who buy their first property to get involved in the company of those who have their own home.
Many affluent areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping up high property prices by taking but not exploiting land, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable real estate to fix Britain’s “housing shame”.
Corbyn has announced proposals for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to renewing the British dream – that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as hard-working Britons.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for many people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland’
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to one day become Scotland's governor.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, by three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after being re-led by St Mirren at the Scottish Football Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only come if I was successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Cani.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn’t feel scared because he inherited such famous names at such a big club, having previously turned down calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross is just three years into his managerial career, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from relegation to the third category and took St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the champions of the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a real crossroads," he recalled of Alloe's takeover.
“I really believed that managing was what suited me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, making a solid income and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 17:30 on Saturday, according to research
The summer heatwave boosted revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenue declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the Office of the Auditor General’s Business Advisory Office, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues rose 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mainly served have achieved much higher profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served have also been affected by the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food-service managers, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand share growth.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “master account” to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, open secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts <0xCC><0xB6> references to a photo-sharing website.
The news has heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they used a cleaned “main” account to show their parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website has found a teenager who encouraged others with the words “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athlete” on the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated female athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a member of the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, out of his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again and today he is doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Shared opinions on the Internet about an advertisement for a traitor who compares mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed their children with cows who wake up to the muse has divided opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable traitor,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by the ironic music video to show the freedom the new traitor gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to music that reads: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t udder, these are my breasts.”
Then there is the refrain, “Pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, pump, husband your ladies.”
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth,” one person wrote.

The second person comments: “Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?”
Someone added, "Completely crappy advertising."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was "funny".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The release of milk made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I understand it as it is.
“It’s a great product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at moms who release milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like a ‘cow’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who give milk say that they feel like cows.
Elvie's betrayer, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between the portrayal of women and cows, we wanted to put betrayal and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's traitor has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had signed up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor’s household in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
According to the shelter workers, in order to speed up the process for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via videoconferencing, rather than in person, to present their case to the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria will be deported.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Advocates said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs that the child is struggling to be overlooked are likely.
Moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupying forces’ to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of terrorist groups and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that have prompted refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive Russian-backed attack by Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There are currently no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed viewership with as many as 3.5 million prime-time viewers.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There is a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade abortion law, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you surpass the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep background” sources for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket that “gives a garment full of hubris,” the Washington Post writes.
I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
“Part of what he makes you feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Shop, about the rotating cast and the day-to-day plot of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you're going to fall behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He could not separate himself from the television, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
“I remember in the past doing all these crazy shows and people saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside is pouring into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a cash flood, thanks to a reshuffle of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban Pittsburgh district highlights Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a separate district in a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally tailor-made in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement has sparked a campaign finance fight between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts have given the Democrats little advantage.
U.S. Should Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdraw
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to invite U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to resume a similar gathering last year, seen as progress in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Mr Bolton’s behalf declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
History
The next step could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was colluding with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If a majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps ultimately a jury of his peers.
There are a lot of those “ifs” and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor those of his kind in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only to have the West oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that he secretly suggested filming the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently ordered investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?”
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the crocheted cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic about facing Rapido from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2 <0xCC><0xB6> 2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing that we could achieve something and we got a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but, generally speaking, the draw is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I am sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study respondents said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for caregiving if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: Root out legal battles.
Involve healthcare representatives to identify a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider giving a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your bills if you are not able to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent finds himself in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide details in a written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan on hand."
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by air gun shots as he was returning home after a night out.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with an increase in the death toll expected.
As communications were cut off, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morawali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree quake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hits the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by an Alaska state police officer.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he pleaded "innocent, of course," the network said.
Palina is charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Saru Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who got in his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in New York's Southern District.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal grand jury struck with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damir.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953, when the couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hoist the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a conservative conference.
A former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, as one of parliament's members, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "gone out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Tories prone to staying behind who join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain her “Chequers” compromise plan amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to “throw away Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to get Chequers out.”
Addressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also in the march, addressing reporters with the words: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and chose us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
She added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be made to “feel the pressure” if they are to let down a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us people and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to deliver Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘you won’t get away with this’.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the group marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Crowds of activists waved “Tories against Brexit” banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unhindered state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is all a farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
For some time now, there has been speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the woman in charge."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims sustained a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene of the crime and owning a gun and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the top 10 of the season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after the order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's standings would "play a big role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton to enter the pit lane, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the free interior in danger of falling behind after a double move in the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran much of the race as he relied on his tyres to score a quick finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was tough because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and is a real gentleman to let me through.
The team has done a really outstanding job to achieve the formation finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and nasty and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and the leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave any information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public – ‘aah, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let go ... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied the information came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t release her story,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret, which is what she asked for.”
However, her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who at a meeting on Saturday night commented: “Let me tell you something – it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own ends.
“They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the malice, the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
In the early minutes, the Giants had a two-goal advantage against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to a draw, and then Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 <0xCC><0xB6> 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 a.m., with Kendall McFaul's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance in doubling the lead by scoring Beauvilliers four minutes later.
In the hurried opening of the game, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard brought them once again to a draw in the goal scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee in the second third, and he secured the win when his team was already halfway through the final third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes team in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on plane avoid earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he was killed while ensuring the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport’s control tower, which was rocking hard.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transfer it to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state-run Disaster Mitigation Agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigiya and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still under rubble and many could not have been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching heights of up to six metres have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “She drove an ambulance every minute bringing in bodies.
The government lacks clean water.
Small shops are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after plane crash in Micronesia
The airline that owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one person is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not trace one of the passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water that reached their waists to the exit in case of danger from a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the docks also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst gives a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors closed the case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a U.S. Department of Justice analyst, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a jigsaw puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he obtained the location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts his previous claims.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same location as Chambers’s at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Mindful Hip-Hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed says hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York Babysitter Sues Couple for Fired After ‘Racist’ Message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, comparing the charge to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she learned that her children’s new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEE ANOTHER Nigger,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an “inconvenient” situation and fired Ms. Maurice, for what she claims was the fact that their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly, and that she was expecting a Filipino woman instead.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for termination fees and seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six months she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do that kind of thing," she told The Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, saying the termination of Maurice's employment was reasonable, out of fear that she would not be able to be trusted later because of the insult.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in that situation.
“That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with the talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will read the book for the first time before publication.
It’s very funny what we now know about Paddington’s enormous success.”
Saying her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before a teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work were rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a braggart,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt like an achievement of your own child: you’re proud of him even though none of it is really your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say it was really bad and to believe he wouldn’t get away with it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad invited me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, baby, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
Medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart working slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then it all went out.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing what was going to happen next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all to myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and tears flowed down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile awaiting a glittering career.
Everyone remembers him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy.
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with cards “so that people would know that there’s someone you can go and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom when the kids opened the presents, didn’t look them in the eye, and didn’t want anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a big hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
We will continue to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought maybe we could bring a little bit of unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was “falling apart” amid a entrenched party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is prompted by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections come in just five weeks, on November 6th, if the Republicans are not doing well, then they will be seriously weakened in trying to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is constantly inviting senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his place on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'declining' under Kim's leadership
The number of defections from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and the higher fees smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from the North eventually acquired South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearisation talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not possible that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical”, says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if she ever behaved like that, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated smear” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not participate in the Supreme Court because he showed prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he's attacking Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed down.
“I’m going to say the following: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not capable of not just being on the Supreme Court, he’s not capable of being in the court that he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law resulting from Roe v. Wade, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'"
Women have to deal with it.
The justified criticism, the anger that has been accumulating for months and years, cannot be rid of without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the CEO and who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she’s talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.''
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how, on one occasion when I was crying out of unspeakable anger, an elderly woman “cold warden” who I was always a little afraid of dragged me to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
They were called “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign had already progressed, she was lagging behind in raising funds, and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
As she said she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so consumed with emotion <0xCC><0xB6> gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism <0xCC><0xB6> that her throat was squeezed.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled the media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The start of the trade war between the US and China has reverberated loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, and recently imposed a 5 to 10 percent tariff on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to hit back at the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is sure not to give up any time soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger an economic crash in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinking scholar who focused on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to restore a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence are fulfilled.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive European Cups and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water at the first stroke, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was kicked out of Denmark by Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranked player of the European team, with a 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop crying today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
It’s all up to the team. I’m happy to be able to help,” said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in singles on Sunday with a score of 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds the record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled throughout the weekend to find a way out, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, U.S. Capt. Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Board, and we're going to move on.
