I'm a teacher.
Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill you all?
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
Somehow we survived.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing.
He abruptly stopped smoking.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I just got up.
How does it feel?
My dog is blind, but likes to go out and walk.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I don't like to work.

Why? Why?
Tom's as tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
It was just icing on the cake.
Pick one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a sucker.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Introduce me to Tom.
After much deliberation, I ended up making things at random.
You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You've let me down.
What the hell is this?
So do I.
That was very good.
She's taking care of her old mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked to the left and right before crossing the street.
Go straight.
Just like beans.
It's empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Maria nodded.
I'm out.
I can't sit still.
Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
I had a quick lunch.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give me one example.
What day is tomorrow?
Can you give an example?
Tom drinks like a sucker.
Is that what you want?
That doesn't sound like you.

It's good to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He's not missing anything.
We live in the atomic age.
Mary earns her living by sewing.
Where will Tom sleep?
Did you get enough sleep last night?
That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I can't get anything out of my hand today.
This is Brian Rock.
Two men ran out of the room.
It is never too late to learn.
We have to find them first.
Tom was very scared.
It's snowing.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom looked a lot different after the haircut.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm studying now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste your words.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don’t have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good tutorial.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of town.
I'm a beginner.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze or yawn.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
It all happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see.
I tried to be kind.
Don't go in there!
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's blown.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't piss me off!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a hairdryer?
You're under oath.
I wish I'd known.
I don't believe it.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing over there.
He is known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom travelled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'll go.

This is a book.
The bedroom is upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you gonna do today?
Taxis are expensive.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
I'd like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father is so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.
How do I call a taxi?
You didn't answer the question.
He was bare-breasted and bare-footed.
I can ski.
What makes you think that?
It's snowing today.
I have a headache today.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.

I'm still awake.
Everyone's changing.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Thanks for the email!
Choose one.
You'll be perfectly safe.
I turned around.
Stay right there.

A man has many desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment for him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, a man would also want to be completely sick.
