From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers is not so interesting.

Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105<0xD1><0x85>195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a plate of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeping body, preventing the appearance of a "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to allocate breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and pollution is assigned to the removable jacquard case supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in a pair to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the parties - the coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

The computer science teacher also can not help, he was not taught this, the school plays games in Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests in the house of parents.
Guests are on the threshold, and on the stove the cutlets are still roasted, the mother is gagged, she houses the floor.
Oh, my God, he's already sitting at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you bring groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are good, and the cake must be with you.
Since then, I don’t like the holidays.
Even for my family, I cover the table at a minimum.
And I cook them goodies, baking very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccination Is Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
About it on Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with influenza vaccination."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
<0xD0><0x92><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB1><0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80> Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with the use for ice fishing, and not only for fishing in the wild.
These vibes have a greater specific weight than similar in size analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in a sled, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the nozzle up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching a pike perch and a large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive baiting is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter trout fishing.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the game Bet-A-Vib in the plumage is able to irritate passive pike, not reacting even to the hedgehog.
When fishing, Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with hazel and braided cords, even large diameters.
For catching pike, pike, perch or perch, in addition to uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chirk" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in hard-to-reach areas, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the baits of its class Bet-A-Vib among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used both in relatively small and in fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, announced 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet planes at Gardab<0xC3><0xAD>a airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Preserve presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya”.
Wagner has been based in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufrah, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to operate in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the Wagnerians allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group does not appear either in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not included in the form lists of personnel.
The company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the representatives of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the European Council on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with the dominant Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
“Less than two weeks are left before the election, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly decreasing,” the report said.
Against this background, the Supreme election Commission of Libya postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy in the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see in the foreign policy of the country more successes than failures, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of success - "in Syria defended, restored peace there", "the decision on the Nord Stream 2", "the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons", "Crimea we pressed".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, – stated in the study of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper paperwork – all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai has announced a complete rejection of paper paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai’s life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the crown prince of the emirate, said on Saturday.
Now internal and external document flow in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and $ 353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkish car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Production and exports of Turkish cars fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry indicators for the first 11 months were worse than last year's result, according to Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year’s figure.
And if according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics to last year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, car production turned out to be already 0.3% worse than last year’s indicator.
The reason for this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 entities of SMEs received a deferment on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses" was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SME entities, including IPs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
In the application of the borrower, a different period of deferment of payments could be indicated.
In the period of deferment against the borrower, the claim and claim work were suspended, notification of the need to repay the arrears, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," the deputy prime minister said.
For 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferral of payments on loans to 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME entities received deferral in the amount of KZT 9.7 billion.
The MFIs submitted applications for deferment of 131 SME entities, of which 95 entities were granted deferment in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the ocmiron strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason is to look for in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "Okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, he encountered no resistance from immunity.
This makes him more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, may be more than appropriate, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - says pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "okmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body’s strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, and 60-year-olds in the form of sneezes tolerate it.
The immune response is furious in the young man, he is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, he beats like a gun on sparrows, - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often only stop the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia until the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by kivid.
In adolescents who go to school, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten students, - said Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT.

Immunologists have put forward the hypothesis of why people with obesity become victims of kiwi
The authors studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, while showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from the disease, and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system’s response.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semyon Goloshekin called the causes of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt Returns 30,000 Illegally Exported Artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return to the homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all the artifacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
The department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house on July 4 held a auction, where a bust of more than 3 thousand years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been auctioned since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of monuments illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations of “black miners”.
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank’s management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary associations, spat with immaginism, he is in himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even spitefully, but the reading audience is ready to wear it on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia" was published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets did not receive such an honor, he was the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
That year, money was needed more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange a family life, to keep the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
over the empty and uninhabited field,
When I grow up in September,
Pours alcohol into the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin has passed strongly, looks bad, is clearly sick.
More and more frequent bouts, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone and put, there are no reliable documents.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again, Yesenin will get to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this basis, the reasons for the police abound - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible novel of the poet with a green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923 Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, immaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
The old man remembers:
“I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stairs.
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having recovered a little, he constantly began to cough, splattering the whole sheet with blood.
Yes, and Yesenin himself after the voyage to Europe and the United States (in the States at that time there was a dry law, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there except the pubs and the streets.
At the end of the day, I stopped remembering people.
And drinking, of course.
I drank because I was thirsty.”

Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon” against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons”
Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Jab<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ski, said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intended to return to such an “operation” next year.
The corresponding statement of the Deputy Foreign Minister made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he “is actively looking for new ways.”
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
According to the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union has introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a joke
At the social events of 2021, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a non-royal dress code green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charitable Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend tried on himself and Lionel Messi.
The player came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci" ambassador of the brand Jared Leto came out.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of thread interlacing, a dense fabric with a layered outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Barkhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event, - explains Vakhoshkin. - It is suitable for those cases, if the invitation includes a dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with affluence - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beauty Brammell". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a jacket of velvet with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in the velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at the corporate party, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then - yes, such a thing in the subject."
If the employee ranks lower, and his goal is the desire to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will accurately assess this with the phrase "not Senka hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very mixed feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so painfully drawn.
And absolutely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don’t understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid.
Billions of investments.
Are they in sorrow?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in circulation - and gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
It's dripping.
Then who's in the air?
As usual, the buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians affect the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots, “failed” energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good payday.
I didn’t see a single handsome person in the photo.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are confident in their beauty so much that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not fit into such, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful (its)", but certainly not because of their appearance.

A slave who is not conscious of his slavery and who thrives in a silent, unconscious, and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he smugly describes the charms of a slave’s life and delights in a good and good master is a holop, a ham.
The immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months may protect against a new strain of omicron coronavirus infection.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period."
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and was vaccinated, or was vaccinated and got sick, then he received “hybrid immunity”, that is, antibodies are many and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of ‘large-scale consequences’ in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly,” but does not describe specific measures in the document.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to “weaken escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would be subjected to "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer’s vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the defense Ministry of Ukraine accused Germany in blocking the supply of weapons to NATO in Kiev
The head of the defense Ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons in the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrey Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not wait from Berlin for the supply of weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “occupation of Russia” part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will retain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany Robert Habek visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store fixed funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend to have a separate card for purchases on the network.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
“Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is assigned to the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be appealed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the funds to the client, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safer Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the differences.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 from working in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia breached Ukraine’s border, a position confirmed by G7 officials on Sunday.

Found money in the wall of the church plumber will pay 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin is preaching, promising that pious Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church’s toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks that were stored in the church safe were lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, once allocating $5,000 for the award and later receiving another $20,000 as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That is why her attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "it is financially significantly richer than all the scribes", as they write here.
There are people richer, but not everyone behaves as brazenly, as defiantly as this lady.

In Brazil, citizens are required to show vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, obliged to demand from those entering the territory of the state a COVID passport, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons who have arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which suggests an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of complete protection against COVID-19
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no solution for double vaccination yet," the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of UrFO, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with the injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be the maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the dog (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to trade a warm house, a nursing home, affection, love and games for a liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the pessal was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
Video mode that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I braked many owners not to run after the dog, although they said that there, 200 thousand run away (pomsky), directly took his hand and led in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog, which ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests of anti-vaccination activists continue
In the Austrian capital, Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make vaccination against measles mandatory.
Starting next February, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading “This is a false pandemic,” “I will not be vaccinated.”
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports, the authorities of a number of regions of the country took against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of protesters threw stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as “the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine”, probably because she began to study earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
But with only one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO found omicron already in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new omicron coronavirus strain has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
About the rate of spread of the strain was reported in the message of WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain, according to preliminary data, can bypass the degree of spread of the Delta strain, which is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which now leads in all absolutely countries without exception.
Earlier, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings have also been made in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the omicron will displace the delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "Omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom sick a few hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day at the peak.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
About how the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "micron" is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Director of Products at Ivideon, the main danger that is associated with the distribution of video communication tools are dipfaiks.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network manages to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim’s friends via video link or create a video with a copy of a person for mailing with the purpose of blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading systems engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I focused on the fact that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow much to paint and walk in short skirts, show stockings and pantyhose on legs.
This is a province, but there was such a product in the store.
In large cities, both Muslim women painted and showed their beds.

There are a lot of fashionistas, and the same cosmetics is not.
Listed are five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by poor nutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increase the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "migraine of the weekend" in workaholics
The deterioration of health at the weekend can lead to several factors
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working weekdays is often the "hiccup of the weekend", said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the Moscow State University, scientific director of the clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in his telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics suffer especially often from this, who have a headache, brokenness and weakness on the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
Over the weekend, our lives change dramatically.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more, and drink less,” the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness. "
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to see what changes the most on the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa have announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against omicron
In South Africa, announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against omicron
Scientists of the South African Republic conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "omicron") corresponds to the (level) of effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which ... calls into question the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - says the text of the study published on the portal MedRxiv.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product, hidden sugar can be indicated - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label can be represented by several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to decarbonize its economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement, which recorded Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Burbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline so far “does not comply with the requirements” of the European Union.

Hackers have hacked the Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to post a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
India’s prime minister’s page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia’s independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Turnout was 43.90%, in total more than 80,000 New Caledonians took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt” as independence supporters urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they would not recognize the results of the latest vote and would challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, the President of France Emmanuel Macron should speak at the end of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have argued for the territory to remain part of France, as it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific.”
“New Caledonia must always remain French,” Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “come out with a united front against Russia.”
The readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," a comment from one of the readers told RIA Novosti.
“Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The U.S. and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine.”

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce jet drones of a new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as ANKA.
This was announced on December 11 by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," he said.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all respects."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was conducted by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where personnel will be trained, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward.”
At the airport from the container escaped two lions
Lions escaped at Singapore Changi Airport.
This is reported by the Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the aircraft.
It is not known from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
Animals could not move away from it because of the protective grid installed next to it.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which owns all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with the help of darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion ran away from the owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer because of vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Because it is found in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, due to the omicron strain may die about 75 thousand people
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron-strain coronavirus in the next five months in England can die up to 75 thousand people, if not to tighten the restrictive measures in winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized in total.
At the peak of morbidity, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people every day.
"Serious coronavirus control measures may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from becoming overwhelmed if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot rule out infection," said Rosanna Barnard, a mathematician at LSHTM.
The UK’s Health Safety Agency said that if the rate of omicron-strain spread remains at its current level, about 1 million cases will be detected by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
To date, there have been 1,898 cases of omicron-strain coronavirus infection in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the past 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure may already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts was 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there was no such hype on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to escape from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, impressive only the number of ordered super-yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have stern lengths above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Recke is building a REV Ocean yacht with a length of 183 meters.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
On the yacht there is a "lunar pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the sea depths.
On existing super-yachts have become common areas for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, as, for example, on the yacht of the fighter McGregor - a platform for martial arts.Professor of economic anthropology of the American University of Indiana Richard Wilk says that in comparison with the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint is not high.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet’s largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail was focused on his 162.5-meter-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners have no sympathy for other people when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships less than 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of intestinal cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how developed four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as a human’s, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or write poetry, do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “trade” over Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries to “enter anywhere”.
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but just send the offeror.
And in relation to Ukraine, a bargain is planned,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be discovered and deployed by the counter-forces,” he said.
China boosts rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said the company’s representative Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed.”
In May of this year, the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. came off the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport of the city.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for International Trade Development Promotion (CCISIT).
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market,” Feng said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having carried out a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary equipment and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semyon Golosheykin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduce the level of abstract thinking.
There is ongoing discussion that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and a risk factor for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, the study of foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community," Goloshekin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” said Golosheykin.
Earlier, the UK’s dementia charity said the disease was increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition where a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council created under the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili’s] neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia,” Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after the prison service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian politicians quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore themselves to their former rights.

In Spain, there were protests against COVID-passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia held protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the Agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
Bills on a unified system of QR-codes the government submitted to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail outlets with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a disease, or a honey withdrawal from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Next Next post: How the Chinese Became Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow to collect 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure, landscaping works are carried out in the region: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is still a long way from that.
Games organization adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the venues of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years, there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway ran from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the locals are suffering without work.
The country is opening more and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of common food with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to achieve world-class.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage, which is celebrated on 12 December, WHO and the World Health Organization have published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and World Health Organization said the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people having little or no social support.

Taiwan’s foreign minister suspended from “Summit for Democracy” at White House request
Taiwan’s Digital Minister Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-hosted Summit for Democracy has been moved to video-free mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was separated in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world by the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her part was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the US government.”
The PRC was not invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map, which was demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the policy of “one China”, which is adhered to by Washington.
One of the agency’s sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council contacted the State Department angrily, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
You're told they're cooking, and there's rotten meat all over the place, in fact, the meat is left at the butcher's until the last bite.
The classic of journalism is to make news out of nothing.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability exists, but in terms of some prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have made with the current administration, with Trump and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress has been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug against COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is present, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary, ”said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person blows out after injection.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" on the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself,” the Kremlin’s official representative said on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% voted against independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were canceled.
The level of participation in the voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most residents supported the finding of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration, under which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO says omicron is less dangerous than delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines for the disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, omicron was registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it (“the severity of the disease” – ed.) may be less severe than with the “delta”, ” the WHO said in a technical report.
The organization notes that while all reported cases of omicron infection in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta".
Two cases of omicron-strain infection have been reported in Russia.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamaleya Center said.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbass.
About it on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called an “ideal storm”, suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <0x3C>...> internal protests and the confrontation of the authorities with key FPG [financial and industrial groups. - Ed.],” the ex-parliamentary added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "the war against all".
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbas, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of groups of the population and the president who disagree with Zelensky, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting power,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can lead to an event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
This variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the poll of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the next presidential elections in Ukraine for Zelensky would vote only 21.8%, while for the former President of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the baguette and not before the beginning of August.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For the quote of Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetofRussiagreaterpoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drawn up a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police treat you this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention as much as possible, polite, no matter how funny it sounds in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya took OMONovtsy and took hard.
I asked her about the usual motivations.
When they heard, in principle, looked, if not approvingly, then understanding.
With the exception of the four-sided monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will serve these 10 days for good reason.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in private at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And even at official events, a stenogram of the old pen is kept, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Researchers have told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements, which contribute to improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body’s systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of ticks, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are better to stew or cook, rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issuance of "Yandex"
Candidates for re-entry
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated runet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
But some – Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix – still managed to survive thanks to including a regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Squid" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the issue of search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" is available on TNT (part of Gazprom-Media).

Springs: in the center of the model is a block of independent springs "micropack".
This means that the sleeping place has 2000 spirals that work fully autonomously.

Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed at the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has a coconut coir.

If the koira provides the correct support of the back, then latex gives adaptation of the surface to the human body.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported Sunday.
The goal of the missions, starting in five years, is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but probably Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample should arrive from Venus.
Suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Paiusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse theme became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook’s transformation into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend is to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third – they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
You’re right, change is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we will have a traditional olive and herring under the fur coat for the holiday, but no one makes me eat everything at once.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
Even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it’s time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O’Neill noted that amid the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O’Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department “Opening Investments”, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar Shulgin called the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue, the Korean brand Kia leads the Russian market.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The relative Kia Hyundai brand growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the rise was stronger only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes from Korean brands increased not so much: according to statistics from the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales volume (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (almost by 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz has both a good sales growth and a weighted average price – more, for example, than BMW – hence a greater increase in financial capacity,” explained Tatiana Arabadzhi, CEO of NAPI.
In terms of sales growth, fantastic indicators are demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
According to the dynamics of income growth, the Russian Lada demonstrates the average market indicators (plus 28%), the Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and at all in a minus - for 10 months the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and production disruptions that covered the entire world automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite the price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recoup past losses, experts say.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially shift the costs of past periods to the consumer, which they could not lay in the price of cars before.
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital. -
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are feeling very well now, supporting high margin sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income from the volume, says independent consultant for the automotive industry Sergey Burgasliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are trying to get the most profit from each car sold, Burgasliev notes.
The increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while the excitement in Russia is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars were a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of an “invasion” by Russia.
This statement was made by the President of the United States Joe Biden.
“There have never been such plans,” the White House chief said in response to a reporter’s question about whether the U.S. has abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 — all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another power structure, then it is inefficient to immediately drop it, and it is unlikely to have time to blacklist it.
