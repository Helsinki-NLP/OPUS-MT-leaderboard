Members of the Welsh congregation worry about being “muppetlike”
Some members of the assembly are appalled by the proposal to name themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum worry that they will be ridiculed.
A Labour member of the assembly said that they were concerned in their group “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means “foolish” and pwp means “to poop”.
A member of the Assembly from Plaid Cymru said that their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said his group was “open-minded” about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, pronouncing the Welsh letter "w" is similar to pronouncing the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The assembly’s committee, which is currently drafting legislation to present changes to the name, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the assembly will of course have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Assembly has been given the power by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
For members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but in the public consultation, the most support was given to the “MWP” option.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternatives, but reaching a consensus will be a difficult task for the presiding official, Elin Jones, who is due to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of performing the duties of members of the Assembly and the creation of a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their nomination.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have fallen silent as churches in Harlem grapple with problems
“The older people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are different today.
Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
With churches, however, he worries that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as leaders expect, and that they will soon be back to square one.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium), where people will live who will not help the shelters in the neighborhood that are left.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, as it is unlikely that people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community, who performed worship nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black religious community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of sellers who refused to hire or support black people on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners were planning a renovation, they ordered bells to be rung.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor people.”
The expert, who stumbled in July, called them a little differently: “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, said the bells were the first to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago to ring the bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin's Church.
In St. Martin’s Church, a complex story with architects and contractors has been unfolding over the past few months; some have been brought in by laymen from the church and others by the diocese.
The sacristy – the administrative body of the parish made up of lay people – wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he and the group swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A rescuer from the water, Capt. Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper torso.
For 48 hours, those responsible were denied access from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is coming to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty corners they have in department stores, and with expert staff.
As part of Britain’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market entry and growing as sales of clothing and household appliances decline, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country and more next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used to use for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the range of its beauty products to 3,000 and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also get more space in branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetic products, so most products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the Concession in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and daily shopping of small amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to department stores as the supermarket chain tries to combat the Aldi and Lidl discount with multiple services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury’s Group has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, increasing food sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals have ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the connection ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury’s sold its <0xC2><0xA3>125 million pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds will play a role in this plan, as it is expected to expand its range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty corners to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially qualified associates who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The star of the show Dragons Den (Good Business) is furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The business couple’s company was compared to Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, 37-year-old This Morning, announced on Instagram that she was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand deal at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when the television’s golden girl admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – left her with little time to devote to their clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow and said it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely astounded everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlowe, there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe the departure of This Morning, one of the UK’s most interesting banking networks, could cost the company millions in large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, as well as additional delays in opening.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple have been vacationing together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about media criticism over what some consider to be a “non-presidential” comment and a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do this?
Trump, with his mocking “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim had shown interest in a second meeting, calling their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea did not see an “adequate response” from the United States to North Korea’s previous disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing to impose sanctions that continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — halting missile tests, helping to free hostages and bringing home the remains of U.S. soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded, full scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, when dealing with the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been resettled, they have not declared a natural disaster, a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” she said.
The Save the Children organization is forming a team to travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are a constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the fury of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but this is not a common practice on other coasts.
The loss of life was likely due to the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge even in the best of times.
Due to natural disasters, the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put improving Indonesia’s destroyed infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for the Jok administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores for late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's pitch a good 25 metres ahead of Chelsea's 1-0 goal.
He put the ball to his left and fired a shot at the far gate.
The shot traveled high above the penalty area towards the right upper corner of the door.
The ball eventually dropped through the goalkeeper Kepe Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I was just trying to get in the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it forward as much as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much more and just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half with a goal from Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward handed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in this action with a heel and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he made a nice pass through the defense, and Hazard ran into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defence and fired a left-footed shot towards a distant gate through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were affected by Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which triggered six-meter waves trapped in the rubble of buildings.
Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, is dotted with ruins of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
Police have opened a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I urge everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the footage from the car camera, to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew a woman came to the scene of the crime and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police are keeping the woman's family informed.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told it may take several hours before they can re-enter.
The officer was heard explaining to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another just outside it.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing Journal 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s Statue in Parliament Becomes Latest Memorial Target in ‘Rewriting History’ Dispute
His removal would be a poetic right for the destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of the statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor from the last century, the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft bears witness to a 19th-century opinion and is part of historiography for a personality that, according to some, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than he is today) as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from his time as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man identified only as “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, she and her cousin traveled from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody mouth in the pigsty.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had maimed a farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and disfigured,” a cousin named “Wu” was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40am to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained so as not to attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market’s management are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks of pigs on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, another farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste for blood can act as a “trigger.”
“We would just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them enough respect,” he said.
In the southwest of the United States due to the remnants of Hurricane Rosa comes heavy rain
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to be moving towards the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast and getting worse.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low air pressure is strengthening over the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, pushing high tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, which will be mixed with the low-pressure zone, will create abundant precipitation in the wider southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, the deposition of debris and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of precipitation in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over much of Arizona, between 50 and 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the diffuse nature of tropical rains.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure zone will bring local rains to parts of the Southern California coast.
Precipitation above 12 mm is possible, which can lead to less sedimentation and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical patches will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday early morning, and late Monday and Tuesday rainfall will expand.
Heavy rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. may experience large temperature fluctuations, as the Arctic cools, and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
There's a 20-degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will enter a warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for temperatures above the average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched an interesting Thursday testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued as television stations suspended their regular programming due to Friday’s last-minute reversal: an agreement forged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee she was 100 percent convinced Kavanaugh was groping her in a wine state and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a tumultuous testimony that he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to see the testimony on Friday.
The company counted average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble counting the number of viewers watching a program in the offices.
For the sake of simplicity, the ratings are similar to those of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads all-day hearings with an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, CNN and CBS television cameras recorded on Friday morning how protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He hung up his eyes for a few minutes as CNN cameras caught him on live television.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” a woman told him.
“You think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the door of the elevator closed.
All television networks also broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to put Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as called for by the Democratic minority party.
Flake was partly persuaded to do so by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of ‘playing political games’ on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, escalated his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said the proposal that Britain and the EU pay each other tariffs was “completely absurd.”
Wayde Sims shot dead: Police arrest Dytheon Simpson, suspected of killing LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to the Baron Rouge police, the 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Simpson and Simpson, and police said he lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found the sunglasses on the scene and Simpson’s DNA on them, CBS television complements the reports of WAFB television.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, according to the lawyer.
An East Baton Rouge Parish County coroner released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Special Fugitive Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “concern and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash on Ciudad de Mexico
The ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of the capital Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of separatism held back by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also fights, in which the police had to use batons to stop the fighting.
Pro-independence supporters, who for hours chanted “without forgetting, without forgiving,” faced unity-supporting protesters and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media reports, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain in the region, which supports independence.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the resumption of voting in the region's polls in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped outside the polls overnight to prevent demonstrations and support the state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with happiness because they could vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite the important, albeit close, victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to maintain their initiative this year, with many of the best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was set on fire by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is escalating,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“To run in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry arrests men who drove their car into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7.30pm UK summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow was also fired at the car.
With Menga’s goal, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga scored her first goal for Livingston.
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to concede his second loss in 18 games as the club's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengay's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian's team in second place.
Gerrard’s team was thus left without a guest win in this year’s championship, and next Sunday they are waiting for Hearts, which leads on the scale and behind them by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his unbeaten streak in the division to six games and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste defeat.
Livingston squandered opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should have led well before the hit, as they caused many problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit past the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, knowing that they could be dangerous to guests when interrupted in the attack.
And that’s how they came up with the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengay, who shot and scored from the center of the penalty area.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but the home defense couldn't break through and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend.
Ranger goaltender Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his foot, and Lithgow shot past the goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The motions continued to come to Livingston’s penalty area, but the natives repelled all the assaults, and two misdemeanors – Halkett’s misdemeanor of replacing Glenn Middleton and a misdemeanor for playing by hand – were not adjudicated by the judge.
Livingston’s “Excellent Performance” – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the cast have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he has awakened the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and deployed a well-organized defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert at all times.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard’s leadership, they lack these standards.
There was a lack of goal shots – only once did they successfully defeat the hosts’ defenses – and that’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters – many of them Kurds – who do not support Erdogan’s government also expressed their opinion and condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protests reflect a split over the visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and despised by others as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in car crash
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near an intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident came just months after a cyclist died in a collision in which the driver of the car fled, on Childers Street, about a mile (1.5 km) from the crash on Saturday.
Police said officers were verifying the man's identity so they could notify his family.
Roadblocks were erected and bus lines diverted, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured in incident
Six prison guards were injured in the incident in a heavily guarded men's prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30am UK summer time and is still ongoing.
Police specialists from the Tornado unit were called in to take care of a riot involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison staff representative said: “We have called specially trained staff to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be taken away by the police and may therefore be further behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-bullying police unit was called to the prison to intervene in a violent incident in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for arid areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest of the desert and brings the danger of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash floods warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged more than 50 miles [60 km] from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitation of up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin, 25 to 50 mm of precipitation is expected, individual precipitation of up to 100 mm is possible.
For areas beyond the danger of flash floods, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region has been hit by a drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry period.
“According to the U.S. Drought Tracking Center, a good 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected to reach the mainland of Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
“We expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation from the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, with a 250 mm chance of precipitation,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late on Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its debris is heavy rains on the Baja Califonia Peninsula in northwest Sonora and in the American Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening flash floods and landslides in deserts and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are urging anyone with a mobile phone who may have caught the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the hostility and anger' of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the unkindness and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage."
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with exceptional record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really looking forward to the nomination,” he said.
“I’m always looking for great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican Party adviser told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom were swept away by huge waves pushing along the coast.
Hundreds of people rallied at a beach festival in Palu on Friday as six-meter-high waves hit the coast at dusk, killing and destroying everyone in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it took cars, trees, houses with it, it knocked everything down,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake is about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communications were completely cut off and there was no information from the Donggala area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms for not informing the public that the tsunami had hit Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the upper floor screams to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseba, World Vision members from Donggale arrived safely in Palu, where employees placed a tarp shelter in the courtyard in front of their premises, but saw many scenes of devastation along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when disaster relief initiatives were launched by aid groups, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to come to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, stocks and personnel assistance are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is still being treated as an accident at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet,” he said.
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing cling to the hope that their loved ones’ miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother’s body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others, trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an old man in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how, in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated through the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu attending the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray check mark, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Charging an ATM in the Center of Newport on the Levee
According to police in Newport, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security worker who was filling an ATM at the Newport on the Leeve Center on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing for the delivery of money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was employed, another man “approached a Brink’s security officer from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses reportedly saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the exact number involved.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted the change on Saturday, writing: “Being with the official name of Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and also used it as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariano Grande, who canceled the show for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible to mean ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, speaking to radio host Big Boy about the album’s title.
“I am you and I am all of you.
I turned Kanye, which means “the only one,” into Ye—it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire to be called Love and Brother Love.
West’s former co-worker, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student violence.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements were beginning to operate in Latin America, peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds it spends on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the best in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite a lot for the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will happen in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American game player Othello, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be to help him find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. need to work hard to get government support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best of universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a development plan for next-generation artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is deteriorating, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide on the change of the country's name in the referendum
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has expressed doubt that participation will be at least 50 percent as long as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I came here to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko cast their ballots in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents erected by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after handing over his ballot.
He added that a positive result would be “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 percent and 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy, which took office last May.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has lost all of Brighton’s defences and scored
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, played Brighton's defense in a 2-0 Manchester City victory.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
At the start of the action, the Argentine striker accepted the pitch in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players and found open ground.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He beat one defensive player and was faster than the others at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
The English striker, with his first touch in the penalty area, returned the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is dealing with leg problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“He played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal in that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
The ball was handed to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball a few times and then sent the ball to Sterling towards a distant gate.
The blue-blue striker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12.55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals have dropped out of the playoffs, so there's no particular reason for another attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the pitch against the Colorado Rockies. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final, since in the Western League match they have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
The Rockies secured at least an invitation from the organisers on Friday with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they are still waiting for their first title in the division.
“While we can’t win anything, at least we can play in a great atmosphere in front of a large crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the name of the first pitcher for Sunday, but it is likely that in this case the metal will be Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first to do so for the 34th time, will do so on Thursday as a relief player and would have had enough rest days by Sunday.
The Washington right-winger has collected 18 wins and 7 losses this season, with an average of 2.53 allowed runs and 300 knockouts in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at a convention in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
They will be one of the biggest – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
“We have this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power, using all possible means. You can see rudeness, malice.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to push to gain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, mean, and lying.”
He pointed out by name a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with a loud disapproval from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. That was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She is impatient with those who express their opinions.
When a Momentum activist in my local party gave me a no-confidence vote, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party who is not welcome for expressing his opinion.
A similar thing happened to my fellow Member, Joan Ryan, because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of no confidence in my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a notice for Friday’s meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party, it said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party, Friday’s meetings were mostly just that.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used at most meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly clear that divergent views within the Labour Party are not acceptable and any opinion must be assessed as to whether this is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I had previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – be it in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social media that call for no-choice, condemn the politics of the environment, and tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments intended for me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis but are not intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how rates of abuse have become quite commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each motion of no confidence or change in the rules for selection, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not be so loud, but I will be “all right.”
But I didn't get into politics for that.
“Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago – a cause of which was the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally brought down the classroom in my elementary school – I have tried, as a local councilor or government minister, to advocate for better public services for those who need them most.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas on which I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing against a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threats of non-election or political expediency will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr to the top of the charts
Two late attempts somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully fun championship game of the day.
They are now at the top of the standings and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the scales on the home side outweighed their superior defense and better taking advantage of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“We’ve been through a lot of tests in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayr team, they’ve taken better chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal converted by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, meant numerical superiority for Melrose, and Jason Baggott intercepted the attempt without conversion.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr in the foul before he scored at half time and then converted the independent attempt to a 17:5 score for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to convert Baggot reduced the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long hiatus due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried away on a stretcher, and Ayr progressed further with an attempt by Stafford McDowall to convert Climo.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player over game with Bruce Colvine's unconverted attempt at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted a shot from David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry into the hosts' fifth attempt.
The star of the series Still Game begins a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is clearly heading into the hospitality industry, as he is supposed to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the upcoming ninth season the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "flowering restaurant" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Navy blue flags are hoisted on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of a coastline in a bloody natural resource dispute with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for a new voyage across the Pacific.
This hope is perhaps the greatest now, after decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be received on 1 October after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects the result in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens around the country and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which claims that – after decades of volatile talks – Chile must negotiate Bolivia’s access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court won’t rule in Bolivia’s favor — and even if it did, it wouldn’t change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments were heard means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they may cost her a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Zarateyeva said.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric has absorbed all the goodwill that may yet remain from the Chileans, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political foothold.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to its promises made at a meeting between rival leaders in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is clearly on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong to think that continuing sanctions and objecting to a declaration of an end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of approving the announcement without Pyongyang first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its weapons, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
On fashion magazines in Paris revealed the latest line of huge headgear that come to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complement your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look ahead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a collection of bizarre oversized headgear that dazzled style at Paris Fashion Week in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the runway.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentine's piece, which stood out most, was a hat in beige color with wide laces decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included watermelons with gemstones, a witch hat, and even a pineapple – but your head won’t get warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter's mask than haute couture.
One creation was similar to snorkeling equipment and goggles, and the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs assume that giant headgear will come to stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow the “La Bombi”, straw hat with 60-centimeter-long fringes was spotted on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The iconic brand behind an extremely impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another big creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model she was wearing.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, lined with raffia tassels and a handle made of white leather, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer — because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for oversized accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish stand-alone schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and the place they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, the conversation sticks to his memory.
But if you speak to a person in his native language, the words are imprinted on his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the scale with the highest success rates in independent schools.
68% of students who studied a foreign language achieved an excellent grade.
Data collected from 74 schools in the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved an excellent grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German pupils, 69 per cent of French pupils and 63 per cent of Spanish pupils also achieved an excellent grade.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as elective subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
With future job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a global world.
If a person learns a second language, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically takes precedence over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, or 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children are more likely to find suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach the languages that are expected to be most relevant to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut in the Lakers' San Diego team on Sunday
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Mike Trudell, the Lakers’ official reporter, tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games before the season,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia today.
It is the first of Trump’s five planned conventions in the next week, including stops in pro-Trump states including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate for the vacant Supreme Court seat yet to be confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s convention in West Virginia and where will it be possible to watch it online?
The Trump convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s convention in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, prompting a Senate confirmation expected to be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of conventions is to help Republicans, who face a major election in November, gain new momentum.
That’s why President Trump’s campaign has dedicated these five conventions to “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“Congressional oversight is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s convention at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, according to West Virginia MetroNews, drawing interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, scoring more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public opinion polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s a bad sign that the president needs to come and ‘lift him up’ in public opinion polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still has a desire to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon duels between two couples (foursome) may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed this year.
The swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the pendulum swing to now?
“They had six points and now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, as it leads by four points, and it can get 12 more.
But the Americans, Spieth says, feel that they have the wind in their sails, and they were encouraged, among other things, by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the green and gives a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when he and Thomas tied in the fourth game after a two-point delay.
The blow that brought them victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming pair of Europe have won four points out of four and are infallible.
The Molliwood pair were the only ones not hit by a bug on Saturday afternoon, and avoided the bug on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way the energy seems to flow between them and the noisy audience is confirmed by the fact that they are the players who will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal a possible victory for Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over the Le Golf National.
Maybe both at the same time in different places.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to the buggy and two double buggies on the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
The players will not be able to play on Saturday.
Four-ball games and two-pair duels are an exception to the interesting closely watched due to the communication between couples, the tips they give each other, the tips they don’t give each other, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a big advantage before the last day, but the duels of the two pairs showed that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes to the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's four-ball games and two-match lead with 10-6 against the United States.
The excellent pair, consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave their best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and four points on the Le Golf National course.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, which is striving to win the trophy it lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had the advantage over the American team that had sinned in the morning games with four balls and led in the series with 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in the duels of two pairs, where they won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual bouts to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the pair dubbed "Molliwood") are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they proved themselves again and even more convincingly defeated the spent Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and two-doubles matches, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had been rested for the morning's four-ball game, returned for the duels of the two doubles and paired with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopka, both ranked first and third in the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, they won decisively against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a two-twos match, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned after four points behind each other, although Fury's team only needs a draw to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem like too much for her to handle.
North Korea: 'We will not unilaterally disarm without confidence'
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is creating growing mistrust in the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken a number of “important measures in good faith” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, tearing down a nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be sure of national security, and under such conditions, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12. At that time, Kim pledged to work for the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also called for the lifting of international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that we must first disarm ourselves with nuclear weapons, and increases the pressure with sanctions to forcefully achieve its goals, and even opposes the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions further deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president outlined at the U.N. assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If we had discussed the problem of nuclear disarmament with South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
Still, the tone of Rio’s speech was completely different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the continental United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Wicked President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations assembly, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable, adding: “It could be two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must resolutely continue without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to deny funding for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said there had been progress, and North Korea criticized him hours later, saying his demands were "gangsterish".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to demolish a missile test station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
Kim said Moon was referring to the “appropriate measures” that Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to get more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight the growing machismo culture of “full-time” learning, in which strength accumulates with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the basics about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, designed the course, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I only know this now that I’m in my senior year?”
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that this surprised him.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for academic and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, says they opted for such a course when they found that students were significantly sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm door where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to gain information on the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic success, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by cigarette smoking,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present in the “all-night learning experience”, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, represent growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brain goes into starvation mode due to lack of sleep, which makes students constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, Raymond So, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his freshman year at Harvard, he attended one of the professor’s lectures.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the campus.
He hopes that in the next phase, postgraduate students will be able to ask to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm clock for sleeping as well as waking up. He also wants to draw their attention to the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance of the circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a goal sank the hopes of Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in the away game: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared the team of Steven Gerrard to a 1 : 0 defeat.
The Ibrox team were chasing their first away win after a 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone Stadium, but Gary Holt's team scored a second defeat in 18 games since heading the Gerrard team, leaving his team behind for the Scottish League's leading team by 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, but the selected Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to a frequent place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with a difference in goals, the Hibernian team was behind.
Calum Spence, a side referee, suffered a head injury when, according to reports, an object flew into him from the fans' seat of the visiting team.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that easily defeated Ayr to qualify for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stuck with the proven 11-year-old Livingston, who had stripped Hearts a week earlier, and was no doubt impressed by how his runaway team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after the start, when Meng found Scott Pittman with the first short pass, who then went on to score for Allan McGregor, but the midfielder was inaccurate in the performance and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's long free kick then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but the ball was then missed by his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow.
In the final third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after a collision with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match, a penalty shot should have been awarded, but Judge Steven Thomson crushed the Colombian's demands in the mud.
The Rangers were only able to score two shots in the first half, but neither Lassana Coulibaly's head shot nor Ovie Ejari's limp ball posed any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already fully deserved because of his perseverance.
The Rangers failed to cash in on another Jacobs long-run sequel.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher got the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's pitch for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly with winger Ryan Kent during the break, which immediately proved to be a pass to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
Nevertheless, Livingstone continued his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of several passes before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate after the pitch from the corner.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday issues: on September 30, 1882, that is, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
It has become a staple in the scientific world, and it has also gained its place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter. It's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity in the materials on the atoms.”
Evans: “Oh my gosh, they’re really talking now!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells and Destroy Them
The vaccine as part of the therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then altered in the laboratory
After that, they can “see” the protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which the immune system learns to recognize the attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are altered in the laboratory to "see" the HER2 protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients who are “taught” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West performed a pro-Trump act with the inscription MAGA on the hat after the SNL performance.
The audience was not impressed.
Kanye West was booed in the studio of Saturday Night Live after a freak show during which he expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After finishing with his third song, "Ghost Town," wearing a hat that read "Make America Great Again," West began attacking Democrats and re-expressing his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump when he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
The show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The recording of West's monologue was not broadcast, but it was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock intended to make fun of West.
West complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in the back of the head due to the inscription on the cap.
“They’re on the stage with me.
They told me, ‘Don’t go on stage with that hat.’
I've been harassed!
They say I’m lost,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to put on “Superman’s cape, because that means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?”
Try it with love.”
His comments made the audience whistle at least twice, and the SNL team members were obviously embarrassed, and someone said of Vanity: “There was a death silence in the studio.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West caused a lot of astonishment with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a Perrier bottle of mineral water.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING PARADISE.”
The talk show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West is simply “what he is, and that’s just fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth "be a being formally known as Kanye West.
Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, was the first musician to change his name.
His colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing man in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington speaks out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swinging sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who strongly condemned the stereotype of a macho hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on the screens, young guys often feel that they can earn respect only with perseverance.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that, in his opinion, something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he has strong beliefs about the subject.
“Personally, I’m seriously wondering where we went wrong when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men when we were growing up about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the display of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do they teach us on TV and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose this particular side of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is, how can we change that?
“There was something wrong with the young man.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in the filming of any pre-story or the continuation of Game of Thrones, because he "ended it with battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard’s True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose on the set.
“I met my wife because of this show, so she kind of gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease is transmitted through sexual intercourse, which represents a change compared to the past.
HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains widespread.
Because conservative values still apply in the country, according to research, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaks on Republican senators, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff published information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Democrat from Los Angeles has claimed that these accusations come from individuals and websites of the far right.
“Lies, lies and more intolerable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was released online Thursday by an unidentified Capitol Hill official during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after three senators concluded questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that it is possible to identify the source of a post allegedly linked to Senator Waters’ office via the IP address and conclude that the information was published by someone from the staff, Hill reports.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and pure lies,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identities, personal data and security are compromised by these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These baseless accusations are completely untrue and pure lies.”
Senator Waters’ statement quickly met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Out of this denial of the branch of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It may not be the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t show anger.
He can't resist.
And he can't question the motive of the one who accused him.
He has to stay calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters’s response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections for the city of Waters, took to Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her cabinet had informed “relevant institutions and law enforcement agencies regarding these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English Returns to Action as Secret Agent Rowan Atkinson
Searching for hints of Brexit in any new British film has become a tradition, and it also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 with the title Johnny English and a sequel in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how bad we are be a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English, with bulging eyes and unusual grimaces, obtains permission to remix the characters; his very name suggests that he is a comic character created for a cinema audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It's about a clumsy secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean, and a little bit of the one who contributed the final note to the song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a trail of chaos.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English approached in a helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and the rotor blades were briefly wrapped around his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for comedy is clearly shown, but the humor seems a bit mild and overly unnecessary, especially since “serious” films like 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems that the humor is aimed at children and not so much at adult viewers, which is why Johnny English’s repulsed occasions for me are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s silent sketches in the role of Mr Bean.
It is now clear that the UK is in serious trouble.
An online hacker infiltrated the online network of Britain's most secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble for the competent agent represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is a turning point for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a breakdown due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has gone to great lengths to play the supposed Theresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script to help her.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies have been exposed, so she must choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school who unofficially teaches how to act undercover: here the screenwriters are hit, as English conducts a kind of spy “rock academy”.
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets longtime collaborator Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets lost quite a bit.
Thus, Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble on behalf of Her Majesty's Secret Service, encountering the fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously swayed by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: Dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos as they sneak onto the roof of Volt’s yacht, and when English tries to use virtual reality goggles to get acquainted with the interior of Volt’s house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the cuteness and energy, it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: is the British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies planning a four-day working week for the British people, and would be paid for a five-day working week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The customer wants company leaders to see the savings that companies are making from the AI revolution spill over to the workers and give them an extra day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits with the party’s economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day workweek as it is a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-week work week is a goal that we will strive to achieve with the customer’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the customer’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
This goal is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-week workweek is not a party policy and the party does not think about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from “reckless CEOs” and “beneficiaries” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current stakeholders in water utilities may not regain their full stake, as the Labour Party could introduce “deductions” on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on board and introduce equity integration funds, shifting 10% of the stake in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed in "60 Minutes" whether their opinion could be changed by the Kavanaugh investigation conducted by the FBI.
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the office of any Republican senator could convince him to withhold his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the “60 Minutes” show, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could find anything that would change its mind.
Kennedy seemed more open about it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him, when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’”
He was determined, unyielding, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved into the stone.
“I have formed my own opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very convincing reason to change him,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she had named could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring a truly extraordinary array of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: to end poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands of people will take part in the festival, this time for the seventh time. They will occupy the Grand Canyon of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their poverty eradication goal.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called “clictivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
According to the Global Citizen movement, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters have been recorded since 2011 in pursuit of a series of different goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that its actions were the result of 390 commitments and messages, on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” who have pledged $35 million in aid to Rwanda to help end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition in historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Food Partnership, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, had announced it would co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the most common questions on the site, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Among some of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports – US Interior Ministry
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner, said that Washington could use the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy sales, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they market it in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, however, there are ways and means to cope with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy makes sure that our maritime routes are open and if necessary blocks them, thus preventing Russian energy from flowing to the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that has been referred to as the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence and replace fuels,” he said, calling Russia a “pony that knows one trick,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration seeks to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is aimed at ousting Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is expected to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, and that this is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same position that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The interference of a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me,” Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “examine” her candidacy for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "examine" her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will be reviewing my candidacy for president in detail.”
At a meeting at the city hall, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump for “leaving this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly criticized Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of her own voters believe Warren should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, with fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former Gov. Deval Patrick has more support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
Other senior Democrats who would be eligible to run in the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a rally in support of Donald Trump mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through on his return, connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told an audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son’s arrest as an “elephant in the drawing room” and said her son and other war veterans were returning “slightly altered, hardened, wondering where the respect for what fellow soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military have donated to the state is.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence for assaulting a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in a vindictive state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the repeal of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal repeal of a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence the right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the district filled the courtroom on Friday to support the legal repeal of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff was not disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy.
She said her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang,” had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys general of the federal states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous U.S. asylum applications come, as countries that are constantly grappling with gang problems and domestic violence.
In 2014, a new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "despises decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Prosecutors said in the request that a policy denying immigrants the right to enter harms the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue efforts are underway to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her feverish boyfriend at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Rescuers are constantly bringing in bodies.
“There is a lack of clean water.”
It looked like the townspeople, returning to the ruined homes, breaking through the soaked stuff and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think it pushed me against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘harassing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after the publication of a four-page ad in an official Chinese newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Sunday mentioned China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, something China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials have described Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington’s intensifying efforts to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange blows by imposing tariffs on imported goods.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to hurt exporters in federal states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now duplicates this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government used the cherished American tradition of free speech and the free press to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions on the stands with newspapers in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic path, as the media is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has rejected an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans Lose Voters Before Midterm Election With Kavanaugh Breakdown, Analysts Warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, will be evident in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
Feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School of Political Science, for an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute pressure to investigate the FBI would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, and they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate hallway as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue to support Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic news website reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will transcend all boundaries,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already strong, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undecided voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t like the president but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the council vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also about the way Republicans deal with Republicans and how they treat Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic-supporting Priorities USA group, told the channel.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided between whether to believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a few more supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or most likely to believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent said they are certain or most likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during the testimony, while only 30 percent said he was lying about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, had assaulted her in a cul-de-sac.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate showed her genitalia when they were at a party together while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to combat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was to "rule the world".
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a "personal data storage" or POD
This may include contact information, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s similar to having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The peculiarity of personal data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
The company calls this “personal data empowerment.”
Chief Executive Officer John Bruce says the company’s idea is to bring together the resources, processes, and relevant skills that will make access to the Solid platform possible for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a handful of developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether we could introduce a complete change that could end all of their business models overnight."
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to “provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Feast of the First World War Victoria Cross
For more than 100 years, the city has celebrated the award of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the Church of England who won it as a fighter in the First World War.
The venerable Lt. Col. Bernard Vann earned his acknowledgment on 29 September 1918 in the attack on the Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was shot by a sniper and never learned that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel’s grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act, which earned him an award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the St. Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire of the battlefield and machine guns."
He later flew towards the firing line, leading the line forward with "greatest heroism", and then attacked the machine gun himself and hit three squad members.
Lt. Col. Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 2018, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve, so teach me humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade" and that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be expressed by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts watched all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were given Pepe the Pig.
Imagine: You’ve been up all night watching a completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The San Jose event consisted of 13 duels, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were startled to discover that the broadcast had been replaced by a performance of a cartoon by Piglet Pep.
Many people were not very impressed, because he stayed awake until the morning because of the duel.
One fan described the switch to a children’s cartoon on Twitter as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to a government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the transfer.
"Puppy Pepa." Yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they are trying to adjust the schedule so that viewers in the UK are included in the future.
“When I think about replays, I think we could arrange that,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning, and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of messages were exchanged during the switch and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed that it was just a technical error.
But the real reason was a government decree.
I can promise you that this will not happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five duels – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than expectations, and we counted on that.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “worthless” about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone – but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he became aware of the fact that “not everyone is like him” when he entered high school.
Speaking on the first episode of Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valued" than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an influential advocate for LGBT rights and has appeared twice this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” by his romance with the man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years his senior last year, but says the age difference never meant a problem.
“When you’re that young,” he said, “at the age of 14 when he attended the first Olympic Games and his father died three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.”
The couple adopted a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley says this changed his "whole view".
“If you asked me last year, all I would have to say is ‘I have to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.”
The son has the same name as Daley’s father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he already had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t say to him, “You won’t be in the front row this time, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally have to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympic Games in front of a domestic audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – Heather Small’s Stream, which accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which still makes his skin crawl.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15am (BST).
Mickelson won the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back in shape so that it does not become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was left sitting by Captain Furyk on Saturday fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was so often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what weighed him down.
Given that even at the peak of his career, he did not measure the most directly, the 48-year-old does not fit best in the narrow field of Le Golf National, where a long ice inevitably punishes missed shots.
And if just the pitch wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will be dealing with the exact winner of Sunday’s British Open, Frances Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer games at the beginning of the 12 individual games, had a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but otherwise he did not say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, patting me on the back and hugging me with his hand and saying he’ll be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the celebrities and has made a huge contribution to the teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way and we thought it was the right thing to do.
He wants to play like everybody else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder Cup’s career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and it’s great to have him in the team space,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they faced him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage may soon come
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, and broke through the finish line with a hair-only advantage, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Remember that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led on the Le Golf National led with 10-6.
History shows me, and everyone on the team, that the Cup is not over.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
The game's not over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He’s been saying all along that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about his players playing on a challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never overtake here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow, the game of individuals will be at the forefront, so this will have to be tackled differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you’re there on your own, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: Tomorrow you need to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the twists and turns in the final day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players to the final day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start as quickly as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gets tenacity, it puts a lot of pressure on the midgame.
We created a proper layout and put the guys in a way that we felt we would do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the battle and face Rory McIlroy in the best game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“With this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the individual selection.
New German Warship Delayed Again
The German Navy’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but due to system failures and rapidly rising costs, it won’t be until at least next year, local media reported.
The handover of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The vessel is due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by worrying post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigate class.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates are expected to remain out of port for up to two years.
Continuous delays mean that high-end warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to exert its influence overseas, will become obsolete by the time they are launched, Die Ziet newspaper notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key “programming and technical flaws” that would make a warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wurttemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the possibilities of the Navy for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
This is expected to reach a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy was in fact “lacking ships suitable for deployment.”
The official said the issue has escalated over time as old ships have been dismantled and replacement vessels have not been provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Wurttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Endowment eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
A new study is underway on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland to find out how bats use food to hunt for food.
They hope the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will track small bats and tiny bats, and brown bat heads and circumferential bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At the key sites of the estate, special recorders will be installed to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what kind of things they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a NTS conservation consultant, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how they are used by each individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flywheels and some types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats, also pose a risk.
Bats are not really blind.
Because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they use their ears rather than their eyes to catch prey.
To accurately determine the faults and obstacles along the flight path, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, shelter inspections and occasional rescues.
The organization has even established the first and so far the only Scottish reserve specifically dedicated to bats on the Three estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is ideal territory for them.
“We have a great bat area on Threw,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all the quality habitat.
However, much is still known about bats, so the work we do here and on other estates will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, since the possible accidental destruction of a single maternity hospital of bats can lead to the death of up to 400 females and puppies, which may mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity hospitals.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply don’t know how well their populations are holding up.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers prepare for German magazine's lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event.
Speaking to 142 million followers in an Instagram Live video hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is fake news,” a five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to use my name to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the job I'm doing.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call “unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "non-pecuniary damage in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada, after a meeting at the Mayorga nightclub with Ronaldo, she returned to the actor’s room and was allegedly anal-raped there.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a “99 percent good man” who disappointed only “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she referred to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “terriblely afraid of revenge” and worried about “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she wants to rescind the settlement as she continues to suffer severe trauma as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before the move from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, under a $100 million deal, he moved to Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret forever’ loss of carmakers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain would “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said on Thursday.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been raised by other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “timely basis”, with parts from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March, this could lead to disruptions at the borders, which industry representatives say could lead to congestion and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store parts for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks”.
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The data not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue with a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be stopped, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite factory union, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job is never recovered.”
The government representative said: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” because of the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian election meddling, links between Trump associates and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general’s envoy, threatening Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using a wiretapping device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he was planning to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said he “preferred not to fire” Rosenstein, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for it has not yet been set. It could have happened this week, and given everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court, it could have been postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to keep you informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a White House press briefing since September 10th.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of meetings should not be attributed to the resistance to “placing” TV reporters, but she said: “I couldn’t deny that they are.”
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without naming the source: “We looked at the numbers.”
“But if journalists can address the president of the United States directly with their question, that’s infinitely better than discussing it with me,” Sanders said.
We are trying to make this possible, and you have seen that we have done this a lot in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared openly and in part bizarrely in front of the assembled press.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to NHS Scotland staff on Brexit concerns
The Health Minister wrote to the EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to continue the work even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued as we approached decision-making this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-EU countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
You can feel completely at home in Scotland, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie treated for head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery following a head injury in Saturday’s 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of The Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury happened just before halftime.
“He got to the edge of the field and sort of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the field before placing him on a stretcher and taking him off the field for further examination.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details about the type/volume of the injury are not yet known,” and that Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, plays for Tenneese State University for the first time since switching from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five strokes before retiring from the game, raising his total number of strokes in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless, according to new plans by the Tories.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK, and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May will say today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and higher taxation of high-income earners.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra money will boost the government’s efforts to end homelessness.
The mark-up – which will be charged in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and rental properties – could amount to no less than 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that UK non-citizens will buy 13 per cent of the newly built London properties, leading to price increases and a harder time buying the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Major construction companies have accused the price hikes of grabbing land that they don’t actually use, and Mrs May has called on her to abandon affordable housing quotas in order to fix Britain’s “housing shame.”
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to error-free forced evictions.
In addition, it wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to renewing the British dream – that life must be better for each new generation.
This also means the correction of our dysfunctional housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes as it is for garage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is all too distant, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “ultimate goal” is to become manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving North-East, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, with three points less than the first-placed.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Championship again in the final season.
“I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I received a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland frequently in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only have had this opportunity if I had been successful in managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss, who has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as the successor to such big names, he felt no fear.
“Success for me is measured by the question, ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’
In terms of structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy road to get there, but it would probably be considered a success only if the club could take it there again.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years after serving as assistant manager at Dumbarton and as part of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
Alloi then helped prevent a relegation to the third league, and St Mirren led from the edge of the relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he recalled of Alloa’s takeover.
“I was really convinced that being a manager was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing well as an actor, so I had a relatively good time and achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a lot of things to face each week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I simply feel like the right thing to do.
I’ve always wanted to run a club, and that’s what I’m doing right now, and I feel most comfortable in my own skin all my adult life.”

The summer heat has boosted revenues for hard-to-break British pubs, but pressure on restaurant chains has also increased.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who prepared the data, said: “The persistent sunny weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month, when pub revenue increased by 2.8%, only restaurants were still behind.
The decline in restaurant traffic by 1.8% in June increased further in July.
The traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased more by comparison than the traffic in restaurants decreased.
Due to the sunny weather, sales have also decreased in pubs, which mainly offer food, but not as dramatically as in restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and sales of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s group of leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When selling on the catering market, the biggest factors remain the weather and the impact of major social or sporting events.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% year-on-year decline will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
For restaurant owners, a long hot summer could not have come at a more inopportune time, and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will be brought about by the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in brand adoption.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a benchmark for sales in the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established industry reference.

The news has raised fears about the publication of sexually-related content
Twenty percent of high school students said they have a “master” account that is dedicated to their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – create an account on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sexually-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censored “main” account they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who happened to run into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter noticed that she was inviting visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Principals (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, of which half admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are succumbing to the temptation to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “Voice of Athletes” at the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as Non-Executive Director of the Annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has a lot of respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland would benefit enormously from its inclusion on the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m thrilled to be able to act as a voice for the athletes, and I hope to truly be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am practicing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows shared online reviews
A company that manufactures breast pumps shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers to cows when milking.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump”, consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that aims to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a haystack filled with hay on a song that includes the following lyrics: “Yes, I’m pumping, and no tail is visible,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my boobs, these are my boobs.”
The choir continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on Facebook’s website, caused quite a stir online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was a joke about the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen in the first days after birth,” wrote one.

Another commented: “Of course, it’s traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “The ad is completely unfeeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she found the song "to die for funny".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
“It’s a great product,” another wrote.
Someone commented, “It’s a funny ad that targets moms who drain their milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a nursing bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby, and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at mothers, further commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
By drawing a parallel between women pumping milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on pumping milk and all its challenges, while showing in a fun way that women can connect with an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked behind designer Marta Jakubowski on a runway while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to Texan Border Tent Camp
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they fear that asking for a child would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In order to treat children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Many will show up with a video conference call rather than in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to shelter workers and reports generated in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
Advocates have said these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s distress are more likely to go unnoticed because of their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without emotionally preparing them or giving them a chance to say goodbye from friends could complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish ‘occupying forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and would “act accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have had to flee their homes since 2011, is “almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has some 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are changing the political issue into what should be an exclusively humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on an end to the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the rebels’ last major base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who “will be uprooted.”
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee, saying the committee’s work should be limited “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
After this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
What would have been without a doubt “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at its peak, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, according to Nielsen, more than four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on the nightly breaking news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the director of the drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, acclaimed comedy writer and author of Just Funny Pieces: And Some Hard Truths About Snooping at the Hollywood Boys Club, offers a different explanation.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide the future of Roe v. Wade given whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, a six-hour viewing of a round table of experts discussing the use of the source “from a deep background” for Bob Woodward’s Fear, a $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (“clothing thickly lined with bloat,” The Washington Post said) and the ramifications of Trump’s shocking descriptions of the khem.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does, which gives the impression of a reality show, is to offer something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the cast of the Trump show and the daily twists of the script (N.F.L. duel, praise for Kim Jong Un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode, otherwise you’ll be behind schedule.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside his home on the north coast of Kauai at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7°C), but he was tangled inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
There was no way he could tear himself away, even as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the air.
“I remember we were making all these crazy shows back then, and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money is flowing into the preparation for the closest midterm parliamentary elections
Unsurprisingly, the 17th arrondissement of Pennsylvania has seen a flood of money as two candidates race for the same seat due to a reshuffle of congressional districts.
This recently re-divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in a second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th arrondissement, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th arrondissement.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally drawn in favor of Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th arrondissement touched on the campaign finance fight between the main party financial bodies, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely-watched March special election for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
The seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the US, they considered sanctions against El Salvador for its support of China, then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s leadership.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to end recognition of Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But they were considering sanctions on El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including aid to fight drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a restriction on financial assistance and a targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and a number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development, which would resume a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, top government officials had clarified that they wanted the conference to continue, ending deliberations on penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing participants at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard-hitting messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice, which is already well documented in public records.
Mueller is also expected to direct the investigation into whether Mr Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to the authorities and perhaps even to the jury of his colleagues at the very moment when he is preparing to address his constituents again.
There are many questions here, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, thus missing the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history is changing and accelerating or inhibiting the inexorable march of democracy.
The United States is facing many of these challenges right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of the Mueller investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he proposed a covert recording of the president last year and speculated about his inappropriateness for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before the confrontation with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a clear victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month putting them in a convincing position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time before a 2–2 draw against Villarreal in the season, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for greater achievements.
“It was a well-deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the belief that we can achieve something and take it away.
Maybe we could win in the end, but in general, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and were a better side in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because in the last game they achieved a good result, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
“The last year has undoubtedly been difficult given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Poor sleep of women due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talk about it with their family members.
Half of Nationwide’s survey respondents said they talk to spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t bother to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t talk to them about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Involve a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the transition.
Choose a health representative by identifying a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that professionals will consider your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider empowering a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your aging parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in your action plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just your finances. Do you know the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.”
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
One man, who was returning home at night, was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot multiple times in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m., as a "random act".
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called on potential witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise further.
With communications cut off, rescuers from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were unable to get any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central Donggala region.
In the region, nickel mining is also an important activity, but mostly takes place in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalo have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggali.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit northern Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands and triggers a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and causing the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A spitting earthquake hit the Pidie Jay Regency in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not start, but the buildings that fell caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old woman from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers Police Agency said on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin’s acquaintances, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone out of their hands.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is in custody under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself “certainly innocent” when asked about his defence, the network reported.
Palin was charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise further in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami struck the coast, hundreds of people were detained at a beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and a cyclist in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice on the death penalty application filed in New York’s Southern District.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty can be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov’s grand federal jury briefed him on a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in support of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saipo’s method as “shameful, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damiano Pagnomeni.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District Court handed down the death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in a federal case in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he had seen on his phone.
Police also said he had demanded the hanging of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “clearly disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip’s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a Tory conference protest today.
A former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would “be out now” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided species has been highlighted by the Tories, who are in favour of renouncing Brexit, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her plan on track amid attacks by Brexit supporters, opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that May would try to reach a deal in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that Mr Farage should be appointed as the interlocutor and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
This Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “In the world wars, we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexiteer, also attended the meeting, telling reporters: “I simply say: ‘Minister President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unpopular with our party and our activists who are active on the streets and are leading us to an election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given a "feeling of heat" if they plan to issue a decision adopted in a 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to issue Brexit, and today we are gathered together to tell them: ‘We will not let you do this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to let our political class, which is on the verge of issuing Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the retainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory anti-Brexit flags after the group’s founding this weekend.
Labour noble Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for security issues when using a client app after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up the IT systems and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for a border without gridlock, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says she will “examine” potential presidential bid
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “examine participation in the race for the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
He is at the center of speculation that he could deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for the post of president.
Warren responded by saying, “It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which demands a woman at the top.”
Arrest after death of LSU actor Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Way Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police station reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts in his last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was approaching the title of world champion, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettle
On Saturday, as Valtteri Boltas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton dry as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton ride on the tail of the traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later took to the pits and left him behind Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari driver's distaste left the inside open and risked falling behind after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then drove most of the race without changing tyres, intending to make a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally finished in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done a really great job to reach first and second place,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before a Senate committee of inquiry, but said instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil, corrupt and lying.”
“The only good thing that can happen, that happened in the Senate in the last days, that we can see the anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the posts and the disclosures and people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer ... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We have revealed it to us... No, we haven’t,” he added about the senator’s impression.
Ford’s letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July and revealed to the media in early September – but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose her letter,” Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill newspaper.
“She asked for my confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not sit well with the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president hinted that Democrats were abusing the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by any means necessary.
You have seen the malice, the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to run over in order to break through to power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win in Saturday's game in Dundee.
The Giants scored two goals early on against Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for home, and then Dwyer again reached the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals scored by Lundvald Nielsen secured them the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the game in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, while Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later, scored by David Rutherford.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan led the home side back into the game at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt handed Cowney a draw at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants lead in the break when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard made up the gap with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to an advantage at the end of the second-third and secure a fifth-goal win for his half-time team and a fifth-goal win for his half-time team.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller with his death hundreds of people on the plane allowed to escape from the earthquake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are hailed as heroes after sacrificing their lives to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
An earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, followed by a tsunami, killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job at the heavily rocking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was coming down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian media outlet ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are breaking when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s Disaster Mitigation Agency saying access to cities in Donggali, Sigiya and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is expected to rise further as there were many bodies under the rubble, many of which we were unable to reach,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.
Palu, where the mass funeral will be held on Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings in bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pali and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday they had taken seven people to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon right in front of the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane went down very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to make their way through the up-to-the-belt water to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, but he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were repairing the pier nearby also came to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in aviation accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors presented their evidence in a retrial to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used the phone records to determine the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from multiple mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he said he was “lying because [my] truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records show that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone in the days following Chambers' death.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial was to be decided by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hiphop?
The hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed says hip-hop has drifted away from its original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York babysitter sues couple for firing her over ‘racist’ message
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminating against her after she received a wrongly sent message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies the racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she discovered that she was black when her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
“NEEEEEEEEE is another black woman,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable,” fired Ms. Maurice, saying her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job and wanted to hire a Filipino woman, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now seeking damages from the couple in court, amounting to $350 per day for a period of six months for doing the work for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, you don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s dismissal was reasonable, as they feared they would no longer be able to trust her after being insulted.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on.’
Comparing the lawsuit to “eviction,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to treat someone this way?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks for his behavior and way of thinking.
Publishers of Paddington Bear Stories Feared Readers Won’t Connect with Talking Bear, New Letter Reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who was reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to find out now that Paddington has become a huge hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book about a small bear toy, would be outraged at the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year was the 60th anniversary of the book “bitter-sweet”.
Regarding Paddington, who she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was very proud of his eventual success.
“He was a quiet man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington the bear was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You’re proud of him, even if you’re not really doing it yourself.
I think Paddington looked at success the same way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed his success to Paddington the bear himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got Nad’s call, and he told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll stay with you.
The drugs given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly submerged and left her system.
She had been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down and tears were streaming down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this intense sense of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are plastering posters on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always say his smile lights up every room.”
However, before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a sibling when he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I am constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered.”
Ms. Davis made the posters “to let other people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davies's for many years, lost Marka, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened the presents, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they have to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She tore us apart.
We have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the air as FBI probe begins
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – in terms of the duration and scope of the limited investigation, it might unify us,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world was “collapsing” as a result of the party’s entrenched stalemate.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections on November 6 — if Republicans are expected to do poorly, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and whom he introduced to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a breakthrough from his stalemate and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim has decreased.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, said 1,127 people fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the price demanded by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not yet publicly commented on this.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily fortified demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to pursue a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the delay to U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without trust from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was “characteristically unfit” to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything else but calling a woman ‘hysterical,’” Ms. Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and suffocating when discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and coordinated blasphemies” orchestrated by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not be appointed as a supreme judge because it showed he was biased toward Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with these kinds of statements and the way he handled Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi, when asked if she would try to file a constitutional complaint against Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, became one for the moment.
“I’m going to say this: If he’s not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s unfit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
And a woman's got to swing it.
It's a fair outburst, after months and years of shedding anger, and it can't be expressed without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem that rare, do you think?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was a director somewhere, who also cried when she was angry, but who developed a technique, namely, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
Then she simply continued.
I thought it was top-notch.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, in part because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories from my early career, when I was still working in a male-dominated office, and I once found myself crying in indescribable rage, was when an elderly woman grabbed me by the neck – a cold leader who was always a little afraid, who dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand that you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they beat you up.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a fence in a boat called the Monkey Business and had to step out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply depressed to find that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me in a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and another one was the last thing we needed.
At the time, someone called the game “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the last one joined the campaign, she was behind in raising funds, so she decided not to enter the match if she did not collect $ 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in the interview that she would not start a formal campaign, her emotions—gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism—were so overwhelming that she began to choke.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the reactions of the media.
“You’d think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
“Is she crying?”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is long over, experts say the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump triggered the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with equivalent retaliatory measures, most recently tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to take an eye for an eye with the U.S. and is unlikely to wink anytime soon.
In order for Washington to give in, China would have to agree to his demands, but publicly dismissing the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused expert at the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup against the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost the European Cup six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems during most of the championship, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole in the par-3 game in his initial shot, which forced him to hand the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of four players to score a 5-0-0 score at any time since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth with 5 and 4 defeated the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played the last time in the Ryder Cup.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European player in the championship with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year has been hard.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for picking me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the relay to compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I was able to beat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four of the games he played in France, and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all week to find the right path, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the championship.
After a poor performance, the American captain told his team, “I’m so proud of these guys, they fought.”
In the morning we put a little pressure on Europe for a moment.
We've failed.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Hats off.
They overplayed us.”
Red tide news: Concentrations along the coasts of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratosa districts are decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier, the FWC reported more diffuse flowering, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles from the coast north of Pinellas County to the southern Lee County.
The patches look about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
During the past week, average concentrations have been reported in and around Pinellas County, low to high concentrations along the coast of Hillsborough County, basic to high concentrations in Manatee County, basic to high concentrations in and around Saratosa County, and high to high concentrations in Saratosa County and along its coast, basic to medium concentrations in and around the District of Charlotte.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported from the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress from Northwest Florida in the past week.
