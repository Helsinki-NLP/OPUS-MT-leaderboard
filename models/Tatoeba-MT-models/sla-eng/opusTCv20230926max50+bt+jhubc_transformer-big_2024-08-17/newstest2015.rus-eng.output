FANO of Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Scientific Organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the Expert Session for the year and form a final list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events on the formation of a single approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative documents is under approval.
According to the results of the next session, we should complete the formation of scientometric and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," Elena Aksenova, Head of the Expert and Analytical Department of the FANO of Russia, said.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutions of Russia.
It is expected to result in the adoption of a resolution.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the following address: 14 Solyanka Street, Moscow.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California at Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to search among the stars related, that is, arising from one cluster.
The results of their research, the authors published in the journal Nature, and briefly with them can be found on the website of the University.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, which precedes the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster can lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulation conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to model two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
This object for several million years under the influence of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added marker paints to the original gas streams and found that the rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrest 20-year-old after high-speed pursuit of motorcycle
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km / h in the zone with a speed limit of 70 km / h and through the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbara.
A traffic police patrol in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, discovering that its speed reached 125 km/h when it left a service station on Batgate Road.
Police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then turned into a bushland, as a result of which the police lost sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were spotted near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Carrata police have charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Karrata Peace Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The school year in the DPR will not begin before October

The Investigative Committee of Russia has completed the investigation of the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the TU-204 aircraft at the Vnukovo airport in December 2012.
This was reported today in the IC of the Russian Federation.
"The Moscow Interregional Investigative Department for Transport of the Investigative Committee of Russia has completed the investigation of the criminal case initiated on the fact of the crash of the TU-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline at Vnukovo airport on December 29, 2012, on the grounds of the crime provided for in part 3 of Article 263 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation / violation of the rules of traffic safety and operation of air transport, not entailing death in any way.
The cause of the disaster was the failure of the crew to comply with standard procedures and an increased speed of approach to the landing.
George Webster Accused of Rape in Hotels in Nearne and Pitlochry
A man will stand trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, is charged during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
It is alleged that Webster attacked her when she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to consent".
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Neyrne, which is located on the North Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not “knock on the door” in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock on the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will do this time, then we will decide how to respond to it.
This will not be connected with the slamming of the door, some insults, misunderstood, - the minister stressed.
First of all, we will start from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners for their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are achieving, the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say in a loud voice that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do this in order to punish Russia,” this is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to actively master the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes," Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU’s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time anti-dumping measures are applied against sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to use the mechanisms of the WTO in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the EU’s third energy package retrospectively,” Lavrov said.
How to properly use lilac in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since lilac after fading loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
And next to the lilac, you can and should plant both plants that are decorative at other times, and flowering at the same time with it.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even the likeness of a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted of selling fake money
According to the Republican Interior Ministry, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olonets and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the defendant has already succeeded in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Szeged.
In the course of the investigation, guilt was proved for several episodes of selling counterfeit money, dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with serving in the colony of the general regime.
The sentence did not enter into force.
We will remind, last week two more sellers of fake money, which were paid by them in the stores of Petrozavodsk, were convicted.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervis"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago, when the stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea," Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Maritime Shipping Boris Karpov said.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and the pupils of the cadet classes presented the veterans with flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of molded shoes, tin, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen fighters "Harrykain", in disassembled condition.
The convoy escort consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which there were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects trade union organization as a civil right.
“Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is co-chair of the Progressive Faction Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Workers’ Empowerment Act along with the civil rights symbol John Lewis.
This ground-breaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade union organizations as it does against other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of anti-trade union opponents.
Amending the Labor Relations Regulation Act to allow workers facing discrimination for union membership to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and penalties - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that unions have suffered in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognising that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at this end will be found to be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests.”
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and to have that trade union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as it should.
The official recognition of labor rights as human rights – and the expansion of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against union organization – is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge Temporarily Blocks Law That Could Close All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana
In the US, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the implementation of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginal in June and was due to go into effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have hospital admission authority within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that for the time being, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while still seeking such authority.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to seek power,” Judge John DeGravells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which time the judge will render a more permanent decision on this law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women are protected from the insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from the two clinics who had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say the admissions laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission powers await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of retail chains should be of Russian production, said the deputy of the state Duma from the faction "Fair Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...> For the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chains is included in the package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Sergey Litvinenko, a lawyer of Nalogovik, a member of the independent expert center Public Duma, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
The plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will develop faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately," the expert said.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not make it to the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the imposition of the embargo, this niche has been freed and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "moment of calm" when the old players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the growth of prices for finished products," Tamara Kasyanova, First Vice-President of the All-Russian Public Organization Russian Club of Financial Directors, PhD, told AIF.ru.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to consolidate the sector behind local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies working under the uniform laws of the industry.
On the other hand, notes Kasyanova, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots is not in all respects.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to "catch up" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that poor-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of manufactured in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in this situation, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again talked about by economists in February this year due to the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers in the formation of orders to suppliers to take into account domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently along the path of import substitution, and the system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time,” said Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, such as the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the counters of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also receive a powerful impetus.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still Russian products," Kasyanova says.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, since this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that full-fledged import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide”, – the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who procreate in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
The researchers analyzed disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Research QIMR Berghofer reported that those living in regions and remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
RELATED: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women’s medical path for seven years.
Dr Jordan said the woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current illness and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in the big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of on-the-go services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and programs to support people undergoing treatment away from their home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Neve, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in the Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaybelyak was started in April this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of the work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
Here will provide medical care to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new paramedic-obstetrics station will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
The killer of four-month-old son in a drunken state of novocheboksary will be brought to justice
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation established that on July 26 of this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to Cheboksary to celebrate the birthday of the child of her godmother.
After a long feast, the novocheboksarka decided to stay away and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the SU TFR in Chuvashia, was sent to court.
Inflation has come out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the MAYOR should make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can reduce the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth of incomes.
The forecast assumed that food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," the source said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and predict a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SST) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual growth rate of prices will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced “accurate sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analytical Department of AForex FC:
The increase in prices is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products became more expensive, the government was forced to launch measures to systematically monitor price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting to regulators on a daily basis so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason triggers price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
Had inflationary pressures remained under control, the value of the basket of the minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12% in a quarter alone.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of increasing the inflationary component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 90s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also above the current level, another thing that was then compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, asset manager of the Maguta Fund
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in the purchase of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the gradual weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer lull and, perhaps, this autumn will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “basic age of horticulture,” according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent a home spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urban areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of a house for parking and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the UK has the lowest level of spending on household goods for gardeners.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have reported that renting housing and not having space for a garden does not mean people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said: “Plant cultivation in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of retailing for gardening goods as a result of the increasing number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass cleaning in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the dismissal of the Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
Lozana Vasileva took his place.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who until then was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, according to the newspaper Trud.
I did not attend the board of trustees of the fund because by law we are not members of the board, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I can’t say why my dismissal isn’t reported on the foundation’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday,” Angelova told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of “Investment lending” at the central fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolay Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund "Agriculture" in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund, Atidje Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat in connection with spying report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry summoned the country’s most senior U.S. diplomat for clarification in connection with a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d’affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all leading countries spy on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany’s main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence target prompted a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's largest companies join forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals – eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($ 814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, whose number of users is about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $ 8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, the development of which will be engaged in the creation of a competitor to Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, Dong Tse said.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon selling services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest pie in online commerce,” said Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin.
“There is currently no real O2O site in China, and in this situation, the chances are approximately equal for everyone,” he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the world’s largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number may grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was China’s richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Lee now ranks third among China’s richest people, while Wanda’s Wang Jianlin is fourth.
“This battle is very interesting to watch: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge an even richer one,” said Cao Lei, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome can not be built in one day."
The fact that with Alibaba it is not so easy to compete not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved leaders of world e-commerce, is evidenced by the report published yesterday on financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period is almost twice the same sum of competitors – it grew almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $ 1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has tremendous potential to generate money, thanks in large part to its mobile applications,” an analyst at Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service told Bloomberg.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which significantly exceeds the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions for the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has yet to disclose the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can take place as early as September 16.
The company’s road show, which precedes this event, starts on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $ 20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds raised on US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of food products in retail chains should be Russian-made, according to deputies of the state Duma.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Art. 8 of the Federal Law "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of products of domestic production in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law introduces an amendment to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products whose country of origin is Russia, the newspaper Izvestia reports.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was introduced to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, in which small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The Calvia police chief on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious Magaluf drunkenness centre.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street on which most of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online edition of Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia in the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca to combat corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish National Guard guards on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism from the authorities has a serious impact on the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
Our livelihoods must not be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British vacationer giving a blowjob to 24 men during a bar race.
The authorities of the island have since tried to stop hooliganism in a drunken state among holidaymakers Magaluf, minimizing the number of infamous alcoholic races in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bar Race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcohol-related accidents linked to a frenzied pastime known as "balcony" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
SPRING prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening by 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early portion of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
The squalid conditions are believed to have contributed to the delay in Virgin Airlines’ flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind shear zone — a sudden change in speed or wind direction over a short distance — and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
Calculation of estimates of construction sites in the Russian Federation will occur in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
The FAS has created an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the head of the Department of control of housing and communal services, construction and natural resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyov said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction sites is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, the FAS said.
And they propose to determine the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations applied today.
These proposals are included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
“The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” Vadim Solovyov explained to RGB.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors" in the documentation.
In Minnesota, I agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost of structural elements already exist: methods have been developed for calculating the prices for constructive solutions, compiling estimates for these indicators," Elena Zhukova, head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of Construction, told RGB.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told "RGB", the estimated standards are outdated, but another mechanism has not yet been offered to the business.
“As for the proposed calculations on structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, since the construction of buildings often use completely different technologies,” he said.
It is no secret that the Styrofoam market is developing largely due to government orders.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, the Chairman of the Board of the Expert Community of State Order Professionals, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director for engineering of the industrial capital construction center of Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopolistic competencies and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from someone’s managerial influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a state order system in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staffing of the customer and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer's specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to disinterest in receiving a state order for incomplete work and a small contract amount.
Deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Institute of procurement Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the state order procedure has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And gave the following example: "the participant when filling out the application must specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "type", "similar type", "not lower", "below", "higher", "may", "may", "may not be", "earlier".
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of the 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work at the application stage through a “paper” proposal of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even started, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when they are accepted.
At the expert council, it was also proposed to move the marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon, so that the intermediate contractors would disappear.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the famous rerun of Arkady Raikin's "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and landmines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory was recovering from fighting.
The start of school activities brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's slides before the arrival of students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward with joy,” said Ronit Barth, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little weird” to start going to school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the cease-fire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not take to the streets or left their homes, fleeing to safer areas further away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt they should go back.
The education ministry said about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at the time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has been badly damaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything possible to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and landmines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 schools, which were converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials last week postponed the start of the school year.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to a popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12 months to August 2013 growth, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
Tim Lawless, director of research at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney, house prices have risen 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which saw government spending cuts, where prices rose just 1.4 percent year-on-year.
Mr Lawless said that now that spring had begun, there would be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which would be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sale and the current conditions with a low interest rate, it is likely that the cost of housing will still rise over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street October Revolution 57/1 (the former Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century from the time of construction has not changed much, except for the dilapidation.
Outsiders come here as an excursion, and tenants suffer more than rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, creaking stairs.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and in the gaps from the peeled plaster in some places the street is visible.
Everything seems to be based on an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The object is under state protection, but money for its maintenance has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still badly-poorly held, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be happy in such conditions?
The road goes right under the windows, even there is no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: there is a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are shaking all the time, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
People get used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
We have two rooms and we live with our three children.
And for other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general, the ceilings are a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A nice hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live like this: we are with our husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila surrounds the room with her eyes: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them there is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very closely and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the plumbing system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment casually and amazingly at the same time, like an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was done about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former closet.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
In the real estate center Ufa say, privatization does not matter.
We still get only one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to resettle us, but it didn’t go beyond promises.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, mom and dad, I with my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, large rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are meter thick!
The solution is said to have been mixed on eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
I guess that's the only reason he hasn't killed anyone with a collapsed ceiling or his own.
Only the building still slowly dies before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say so - under our room a secret laze and a path to the White River, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that they could hide from danger, in case of what.
They were pursued.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for his one-bedroom apartment on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused to the historian:
Where are the four of us going?
And here at least a tiny hope is that they will give housing more spacious.
If we agreed to an exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the family of the Elders did not win anything.
Lyudmila’s biggest dream is to be resettled, and her daughter with her 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
Plaster is rolled off in pieces, like window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap all year round is only cold.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can see that the most fortunate couple Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
The room is 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live just in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around breaks at the seams, collapses, collapses.
The neighbors must have already told me.
The most torment we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally went from under our feet.
I put the supports, wedges; in the hall nothing yet, and in the other room we walk, as on swings swinging, so everything is shaky.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The goldsmith is treated like a native, speaks about him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky plants built houses, cast cannons and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they do not want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around stood wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean our house, but something prevented it.
The story was repeated in 2014: again beckoned new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, bypassed the necessary authorities, and suddenly found out that the move to apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
I don't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the tenant.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, issued a paper without a signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of residents."
I even have this feeling that our house has long been absent in terms of the city, because at first it was at number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's as if it's already been demolished in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the Department of land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, only I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses along the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents are planning to move into new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice will restore the Demidov House.
Now in Italy there is an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire old Kazanskaya street will be restored, the official says.
Houses will acquire a proper appearance, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov’s house is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye because of the storm began a forest fire
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the territory of the Hunting District Forestry in the Pozharsky district of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, an increase in the grouping of forces and means is being carried out.
According to the leadership of the KGBU "Primorskaya airbase", the conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the airbase:
The fire, which occurred in a hard-to-reach area, was discovered by an observer pilot from the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood burning residue on the old burner.
The strong clutter of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing sites for paratroopers-fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces available to the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four paratroopers were promptly landed at the extinguishing site.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional firefighting forces and means.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village of Okhotniy helicopter additionally delivered 3 paratroopers-firefighters.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, the specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.

I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born into a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to make his way through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on the relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, would go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of kicking in cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that before.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father’s days, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
It’s a little better now, but it’s dark, smoky, the depths of the labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father climbed into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start to sing about himself because he wanted to wash off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until her mother became ill at the very end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, whom he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why shouldn't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well and had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take drastic measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry’s changing career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-trimmed beard.
Since he gained critical acclaim for his Othello, he has fully immersed himself in theatre.
This was followed by The Comedy of Errors and then The Fence by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For quite some time, I was the only black parody/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke-delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Minstrels Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blackened their faces", Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I wish it would never happen to me, but I don’t regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with crowds.
But what was “an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody of black people.”
Representing characters who both mocked and praised black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series The Boss!.
Commercials, documentaries, television series and film roles took up the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series "LennyHenry.tv" in 2008, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because a little it seems that you are dragging time or slowly folding aside."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't really be taught that in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle-class people with pantyhose and cabbage down the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You should try it.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he got caught.
I had a feeling that I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
“That’s what it is, it’s a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it did not happen.
Soon we started a comedy of errors.
All of a sudden I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
“The quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’re going to have to work 10 minutes while they make the computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "The Fence" at the Dachess Theatre
Learning the text for "Fences" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, “This is what you need to do.”
He says this in a loud voice.
So I'm sticking to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mind - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he begins, then ends to parody.
I just decided not to work in the booth, because this thing about getting instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying to do that, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Live Show when I want to, but mostly I don’t get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm wondering if he'll ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of a journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify ‘invisible workers’
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government payroll.
Employees who fail to register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost through payments to invisible workers and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the civil service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, said.
All government employees must report to identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a good reason will be struck off the payroll.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government - hence, put an end to the problem of 'invisible workers'," said Ann Vaiguru, secretary of the cabinet of ministers of planning and structuring power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies reported.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of setting up an organized criminal group and tapping a phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) identified their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in much of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told expectant journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On the first of September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the person of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader, which she needs
It is followed by a trail of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position in Pearson's parent company was taken by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private-sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory adviser.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the BBC’s management hierarchy itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs complete radical reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming, trampling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself were to lose his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people will be happy to see the BBC shrink in size - after a revision of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of a licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in, definitely, the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
What’s more, it’s obvious that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programmes on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry, from Texas, says the humiliating tweet was written by an outsider
A tweet from Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry’s verified account on Sunday night contained an insulting image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the recording was disavowed.
I just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
“I don’t approve of this tweet, and I removed it,” a later post said.
Perry’s aides did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry’s verified account, it was unclear who was actually publishing into the tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The caption reads, "I don't always drive a car intoxicated, three times the permissible blood alcohol level, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg’s office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law, which is used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history, is vague and unconstitutional.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from state funds to the state’s Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and oversees the prosecution of corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted an official complaint from a left-wing group of public scrutiny.
Perry’s verified account feed is frequently updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Arriving fifth at a party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might quit the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, “Here we are, South Carolina!”
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to “normal”
One of London’s best-known developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
Houses in the capital have been the subject of buoyant demand and skyrocketing prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to set limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013,” adding that this has provided a “stable working environment.”
London’s real estate market thrived during the downturn as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to Land Register data, significantly overtaking the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student-based Berkeley schemes rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stopped by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “house tax” ahead of next May’s general election.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced stricter loan terms, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its forecast for London property prices to 3 percent in 2015, based on the fact that the mood of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter from the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis agency.
However, demand for homes in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: “The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the time being have been maintained.”
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April, almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40 per cent year-on-year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenue 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking ahead of the company’s annual meeting on Monday, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley’s projected revenue for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profit is expected for the whole year before taxes in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The stock price of Berkeley held at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon on the London stock exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received an Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the star of the “Hunger Games” confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real, and condemned the hacker for “brazen invasion of privacy.”
There has been an appeal to law enforcement and they will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on 4chan’s photo sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple’s iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of the victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to The Guardian.
It's unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim's star Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hacking.
“To those who look at the photos I took with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of me naked fake, people.
Let me stop this in the bud. *Intentional pun*
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande’s spokesperson denied that the photos in which she allegedly took them were genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter “J” that has been praised by critics
They dissolved, it is best to say so, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box, which was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw anger in himself.
He was prickly as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this barbed wire was a little novel he expected more from than usual, getting rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with frizzy hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a damp, but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one has lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat still in the baths, the slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds, like giant cabbage cobs.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and charming, with a full of secrets garden.
Author's point of view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the long list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Cavern and Eileen sat, holding hands, in the broken lounges among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they were both absent-mindedly connected to the cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when, glancing at her criss-crossed barks, he looked at her
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren’t lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic" itself.
Public taste did what orders and regulations could never achieve, and just as among books people chose the memoirs of the rich who had grown up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, from all music they chose ballads.
Fascinated by this day, Cavern began to play the imaginary piano and in a rude comic voice to sing the big legs of Eileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller,” he told her, putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with a "J" and forget to put two fingers to your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same with wit.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was wit, expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10, having never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Cavern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that every segment of society agreed with gratitude—the gratitude of those saved by fate—the principle of group predilection.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The natives of Indostan, as if by nature talented in everything that concerns electronics, undertook to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was the plumbing work; what was left of the Greek was the plate.
The natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not hurry to leave the country, when WHAT HAPPENED, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED, in fear that they would be accused of lighting a fire, in fear, in fact, that the flame would devour them next, opened restaurants from the labna and kaval.
Each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could be put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except maybe for people who have big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a single word could penetrate the sound insulation of giant leaves, similar to cabbage.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love this?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he did not want to press two fingers to her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Kevern's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but the dirt of her gray-black hair.
Nothing he wanted to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you just because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverse.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the lounger, tipping over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Wine from elderberry, so that intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
You don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her both because of the excessive rudeness of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was basically like this one.
The same huge ocean of ice fell on both of them.
The same bewildered men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF IN GENERAL, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand to any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
The kiss was now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave out was to kiss her first and then hit her.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed the corps that he needed to leave.
He climbed out of the chair like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the upper window she watched him leave, her companion a man who had borne the burdens himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sting of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hands at her.
The man who had turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, battered, all ability to fight had left him—why did it seem to her that she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years or so before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, the unofficial public mood monitoring service, had prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if not stop altogether, given the resources and forces it provided.
“Much has been done, and much is being done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow settlements of the terrain, where, despite the spires of churches hovering over the fences, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in all of history.
However, some qualities, it turns out, are ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it engenders.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories about the obstacles overcome and announces its ardent faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that a new and evil is emerging in the roads.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” said her supervisor, after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I ask,” finally said Luther Rabinowitz, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and laudable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, as, for example, those that you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call “evil” and “rough” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vivaciousness and vigor.
To continue to be bored with what has happened, if it has happened in general, as if it had happened, if it had happened at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the necessary vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingos, the LED letters echoed the advice Offnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I totally understand what you’re saying,” Esme Nussbaum quietly replied when she was sure her supervisor had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything other than that we haven’t healed as effectively as we have been persuading ourselves.
What worries me is that if we’re not prepared, we’ll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED.
Only this time we will throw our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the tips of his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
“You are going too far,” he said, “calling ‘mistakes’ actions that our grandfathers committed or did not commit.
You go too far and when you say that they threw their “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
In your place, a person should not need a reminder that understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There was no “us” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of turmoil - that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to insert, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what was done was done.
It was then.
There is nothing more to say, we agree.
And as you should not blame anyone, you should not justify yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past exists so that we forget it.
If I may add one word to that,
The pyramid of Luther Rabinowitz collapsed.
"I will review your report," he said, releasing it.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove out onto the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, "in a furious rage."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army Says Coup Was Not Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army has denied plotting a coup to overthrow the government, saying it was acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabaneh left the country, saying the country's army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister has taken his family to neighbouring South Africa, saying he has received a threat of an assassination attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there had been no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat from “political fanatics” that the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements among the police forces that were really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to wreak havoc,” he told VOA.
A South African government spokesman, Clayson Moniel, said the army’s actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to have seized power by force, it is reported that the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho's army said the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in Tabane's absence.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked for trying to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified Government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at Milan, according to the Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he was on the field in the London club only three times.
Recall that earlier "Milan" rented from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone output at lowest level in 13 months
Eurozone output growth slowed to its lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Eurozone manufacturing sector’s business activity index (PMI) for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for a clear plan from the bank on how to cope with the stop of the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
“While some growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibitory effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s senior economist.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the momentum of growth has stalled in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” Mr Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to fuel analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the Eurozone manufacturing sector’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – particularly linked to Russia/Ukraine – are adding uncertainty to the still-difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business – and especially consumer confidence – and is likely leading to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was “increasingly likely” that the ECB would eventually have to make some sort of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Residents of Mariupol will put a live chain against the militias
Until last week, everything was calm in Mariupol - no one bothered to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the “militia”.
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics, was taken.
The Mariupol residents decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but its forces are slightly against the perfectly armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and they are going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
In the evening of Saturday, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closing, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible seizure of the school, like children who found themselves in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school's atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the terrible seizure of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like something of an extremely possible evil.
The tragedy united the East and the West in aversion, which miraculously then grew into action and hope for the future in the conditions of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had cheated death during a school atrocity.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, even though the memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their biggest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl who in the photo is trying to climb back into the gunned down sports hall
She is captured in a photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one of his underwear trying to climb back into the shelled sports hall after the explosion of a mine.
In confusion, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There are a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little and we dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories fade a bit each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and around the world.
When I see a picture on the internet of me climbing through a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the arm, and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed the son from outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with injuries on her legs, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now the defunct News of the World), where he was awarded as Child Advocate by the Barnardo's Foundation by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that it is fading in my memory.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they are dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and the ride in the open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who last week volunteered at a convent.
I'm trying so hard to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope to be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
"She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water gun, and they were running away and playing with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare back then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I still think this world hasn’t gotten better in 10 years.
Now there is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news story they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember him, but they’re very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
He wasn’t asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked around, I saw the hell around me as body parts lay everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after the capture was decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and to the right Georgy today
On his bloodied face was the imprint of fear as he was fleeing death as Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of his studies before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember George so wanting to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of George crying in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in a bookcase in our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
They are now investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how it happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need decades to go by to forget her a little bit.
It has affected my health and I can still feel it.
About three or four years I had nightmares because of the grip, but now it has become better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not going to happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist-murderer
Unbelievable: Georgiy Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-killer during the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We think it was yesterday,” says George, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer with the FSB but couldn’t because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I’m older now, and they say kids can easily handle bad events – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can’t forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005 – the following year – was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgiy Farniev today with an open on a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee, which was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
Still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about my experience.
This is not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should go through.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark her.
I know George won't go.
It has to be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help it.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan the imprint lies on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can’t do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only we could capture all the rebels and throw them as far away as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
The baby who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she is ten (right), and she does not remember the monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alyona was taken out of a captured school in Beslan by a Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the gymnasium of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alyona’s mother and sister died in a deadly carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a young daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Kristina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the capture and has blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both wonderful kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, noted that he is looking forward to being able to go on the pitch again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play for Borussia again,” Bild quoted Kagawa as saying.
I feel really good.
He is full of positive emotions and I am looking forward to getting back on the pitch in the form of Borussia Dortmund.
Recall that Kagawa moved to Manchester United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he never managed to gain a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the English league in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
A man is accused of hitting a girl at the pedestrian crossing "Pelican" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at the pedestrian crossing "Pelican" in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot down a girl at a crossing in Pittenwine, East Newquay.
Prosecutors said Mr Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, causing her to be injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied his guilt in Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal attorney, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not settle in Vladivostok
The duty-free shop of Duty Free airport of Vladivostok has put up a sign forbidding to make purchases in this store to a number of world political leaders.
Do not buy them spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store’s administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japan’s Prime Minister and several other well-known comrades would not be able to get their hands on vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
I put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance in an even less accessible by type of service institution - Dietary canteens of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
Whether the American president ever cherished the dream of eating in a dietary canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheeses in demand from buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the enterprise "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - Maslakov said.
The third place is the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be noted that we did not prepare for this competition.
The season is over, and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the national team.
The French, on the contrary, put up a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were an order of magnitude lower than in the same “Diamond League”.
Season's over.
Naturally, the result is not so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, there was an absurdity when at 1500 m men were so fond of tactical intricacies of running that they showed the result below the average level of... women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve the best quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or shoot video underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof “soap”, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a few cameras, all priced at about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be shooting.
Some photo and video cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Shoot a few shots - because many of them will not work.
Soap houses have LCDs that will help you to compose the pictures, whereas action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the frame layout will be a random process.
Take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a series shooting mode that captures multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly as you dive deeper into the water.
If possible, stay near the surface when you’re shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you’ll see.
Swim closer to the shooting objects.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it’s even more important underwater because of the darkened lighting conditions.
This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling Bilal Mahov can go into the Greco-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan on freestyle wrestling Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahov is at the meeting of the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, in juniors Bilal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third prize winner in the Greco-Roman competition and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
It has long been rumored that a new stage of his career our heavyweight will spend in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Mahov can perform already at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the pretzel.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose strength of personality could shake everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to ridding patients of both the sufferings of the disease and the torments of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors were passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment were mainly concerned with something else entirely—pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who started to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like I usually did,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find my strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself angrily reproaching his wife, Juliet.
“I want things to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and unclear as to why he was upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results are in.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to know the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle” but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban took effect.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe-insulators, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
The UK is at the peak of the Mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
The annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and the projected number of deaths in the future in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that although asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually outlawed in 1999), mesothelioma development usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the stores where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, have proven to be no salvation.
The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he understood.
“It seems there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s hospital, where I spent six years in an internship,” he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors and loaders used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
This was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who have interned at Guy’s hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he noted in a 2010 letter, “I am the only one left alive.”
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to die out, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having inadvertently exposed Janis Ellen to asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
“Before this happened,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, pipe thermal insulation, boiler seams, even in the brake pads of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of harm to health” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Much of this exposure, he says, is due to the “usual use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be set in motion by something as innocuous as “strong air currents.”
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament’s Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a “clean sanitary certificate”, it now acknowledged that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion worth of work needed to be done to renovate Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament may be sitting in the Greens at the QE2 conference centre next door.
Goddard’s report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules.”
It is impossible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation late at night.
All of a sudden, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he could not go to work for a month.
Confused doctors took X-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to him in the waiting room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and a doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I'm optimistic.
I usually just go on,” he says.
I didn’t worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and the New Year: "I was told it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott suddenly immersed himself in meetings with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did), were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turned out that hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its amazing insulating and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in a classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, students installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Web sites have emerged to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful when carrying garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes a long time to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers being baffled by the amount of information to be received.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life – the very act of breathing – that causes cancer, which kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is broken down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the inhalation of the needle fibers of asbestos,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
It was that hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed while interning at the hospital.
When asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Treger says, “breathing pushes them to the periphery, where the shell is.
This is an invasive process from the very beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The Treasurer disagrees.
"You can't cut the pleura," he says.
It is impossible to approach it with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is “not very good at chemotherapy,” which “works” but doesn’t cure.
“There are patients who live a long time from time to time,” says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, single-handedly turned into a support and consultation office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully as they rang.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and he is still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "took it upon himself to give the whole thing a somewhat more positive tint."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need directions, I just called them and they took me in,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment finally inevitably proves ineffective, many patients are faced with another financial reason for concern - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
Then they go to court for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That's when they talked about the bad faith of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy’s Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn’t a “full-cost settlement,” according to Morgan, as Lawson couldn’t conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy’s Hospital.
After the investigation of his death, a representative of Gaya hospital confirmed, nevertheless, that “asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, tying deadly asbestos contact to one company or place of work — usually decades after that — has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that they have time on their side, which the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
In response, major new legislation came out this year that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry has been created for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that a court could award in a normal compensation case – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million represents a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“It’s a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay had it not intervened and patients with mesothelioma could have tracked the companies and filed a lawsuit the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, a former labor and pension minister, admitted the law was “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, quick action was needed.
“People are suffering so much and they need help today,” Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunsky boasted as many as 40 percent of surviving patients over five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March [2014].
There were a few spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I should have been 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things — finances when I die, for example, or what you need to show your wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become joyless.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie’s father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn’t live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ally was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented that is not flammable.
I saw napkins made of it smoldering in fireplaces at banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Major asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were, without a doubt, the leading cause of death.”
This is the first case of this type.

Compensation is not paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos, developed intensively.
Voluntary Industrial Ban on Blue Asbestos Imports
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for harm to health caused by asbestos exposure in the UK.
Global production of asbestos is growing to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK’s Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All asbestos use is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the UK.
A compensation scheme of <0xC2><0xA3>350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
Global production stands at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China’s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to kick off long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People’s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t fool our expectations, but it still angers us,” said Democratic lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
It is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said it would be too “chaotic” to allow a popular nomination for Hong Kong’s leader.
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to vote for the head of government starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nomination commission tightly controlled by Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when there were some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong for many years.
Behind much of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise up in the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organisers said the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to inform you that, to date, all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for several days, and security measures were stepped up at the government’s headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the unrest is the sense that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are starting to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put at risk Hong Kong’s business lifeblood.
“The protest they’re talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We don’t want to spread concern that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
It is a performance that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong-based democratic activists have been shown to be saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands marched in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The American culture of graduation balls comes to university life: first-year students were offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said the service had thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to university with minimum effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the service has just been launched, no orders have been received yet, but added that “students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that while students would have to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year for tuition, it still hopes to find a market for the service.
Today’s students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS vice president of higher education, said: “This project seems incredibly disconnected from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rapidly growing costs of basic needs, before they can even begin to think about taking out thousands of pounds on something like a simple dorm arrival.
Feminists raise questions about race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
They raise their hands, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot” as they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and drew nationwide attention, Peres saw responses from white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the Aug. 9 killings, personal essays with headlines such as “Feminism Is Not Just About Oppression of Women” and “Feminism Is Not Just About Oppression of Women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privilege at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Corita Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how people of color are attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share these problems; they faced a difficult reality every day.
While white women are now combining race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery’s perspective, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in a voting basket for women, and voting rights for blacks should have come later,” Hattery said.
Looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of Lynchings.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch up” with the problems that black women have dealt with over several generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?” she asked.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what this means.
A well-known white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in protests over racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body – and perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls – will lead the change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem vouches for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Business Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young men, are “far more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously voiced.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, Watch My Brother, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police relationship with the black community isn’t the only issue pushing the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories resonate with women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with a pig" for sale
A photograph of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
Put up for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description featured a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on the sofa.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
“However, the photo was placed by mistake and has already been removed,” a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique detached one-bedroom house".
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Karolin Wozniacki in the fourth round of the US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, Vasily Osipov reports from New York.
How would you rate your overall results in Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I am glad that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even get to the quarter-finals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After the defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have a lot to work on and I’m going to do my best to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses for the implementation of GTO norms when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the norms will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass standards for pulling, running and other exercises.
We will remind, 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement the norms of the GTO on their territory from September 1.
I also offered students who passed the GTO to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuev.
For example, they can add a little points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to give additional leave to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought in southwest Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from Saturday night’s lottery draw.
The Harvey newsstand brings gold to the main prize draw for the second time in five years, with a previous win of $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everybody's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the top prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state’s players.
Last week, Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires of August, following the pair’s huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and reported that the win gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.

The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, Deputy Director of the Department Oleg Pluzhnikov said at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles powered by gas-engine fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy of "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend regulations to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 that they also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it an advantage when driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric vehicles in Russia is still being formed - in 2013 about 100 electric vehicles were sold in the whole country.
In early 2014, zero import duty on electric cars, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts the chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold increase does not make electric cars in any way noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remiz, Renault's Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see position towards Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has Russian manufacturers — "" GAS, "" but the output is meager.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of AvtoVAZ Engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric cars in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (refueling stations - units), sighs the CEO of "Avtostat" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low pace of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Avtorev" Mikhail Podorozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to inspire confidence in consumers that “electromobility” is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes the President of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofyin, director of the Rosseti department, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, does not have the right to sell electricity, the possibility of doing this in relation to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia is the zeroing of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is small, Pankov says, in contrast to Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles — now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric cars on dedicated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
The Piper PA-46 single-engine plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are being identified.
In the Donetsk region deal with prisoners of the militants of the battalion "Donbass".
Punishers were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
Survivors say that if they knew what the situation in southeastern Ukraine was, they wouldn’t have gone to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the “meat grinder” into which they fell near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to leave the “ring” along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes later, shells and bullets whistled from all sides.
“Judging by the information they gave me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave,” says the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the Lermontov call sign.
And when we descended into the lowlands between Polyopoly and Chervonoselsky, cross-fire began with anti-tank guided missiles, "bumps", grenade launchers 30-millimeter, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three cars in the back, and in the end, there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call sign "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicine.
At the same time, their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We have been betrayed, they say.
Colonna, the entire battalion to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Alex saw a different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there is a mortar shelling, that most likely it is the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not allowed to leave Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about the departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from Zurakhovo.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the “boiler” near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if they could turn back the clock, they would never join a punitive battalion.
All prisoners were handed over to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
A headquarters for limiting food prices has been established in the region
In the Krasnoyarsk region, a headquarters has been established, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of prices for products in the region's market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive power and supervisory agencies.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev “Rosneft” compensate $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation,” Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisichansk Refinery, which was modernized by the company, was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no fighting, there were no ‘grounded rebels’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes is missing,” he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery, an oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansk Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as diesel fuel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its unprofitability.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk refinery together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
North Korea launched a short-range projectile in the direction of the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, it happened around 10:30 am local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
According to Interfax in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
The ruble falls on the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar rose at the opening by 3 kopecks. to 37.15 rubles., the ruble fell to the bi-currency basket against the background of geopolitical tensions.
Trading on the ETS on the dollar began with transactions in the range of 37,11-37.2 rubles./$1, an average of two minutes, the exchange rate was fixed at 37,16 rubles./$1, this is 4 kopecks. above the level of the previous closing.
The euro exchange rate amounted to 48.79 rubles. for 1 euro, this is 3 kopecks. above the level of the previous closing.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 kopecks. and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading at 23 kopecks above the official exchange rate, the euro at 16 kopecks above the official exchange rate.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
The ruble continued to get cheaper and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already playing in advance the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, for now, it is more like an artificial hysteria inflated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not so many options for introducing new sanctions against Russia.
At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency may adjust.
“Orenburg airlines” will sue the “Ideal tour”
"Orenburg airlines" filed "Ideal-tour" claims for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, which will be held in October.
Cases will be heard by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.

Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting on it is scheduled for October 2.
According to journalists in the Russian Union of Travel Industry, judges on cases are appointed different.
In July, the media reported on the debts of the Ideal Tour to the Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The General Director of the airline Viktor Zyukin says the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
The CEO of Aeroflot Vitaly Saveliev calls an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the registration process for users in order to engage new members more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be browsing a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration in order to immediately compile their reading circle.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a subscription checkbox for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove ticks, so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make an impression about a person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working to modernize the service.
Such activity is associated, first of all, with the ongoing attempts of the service to achieve breakeven.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a drop in reader activity.
At the moment, the company desperately needs more loyal consumers, who, once in a while, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be cold and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, meteorologists say.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy and clear weather, rain will pass in places, the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The car recycling program resumed from September 1
From September 1, Russia will resume the program for the disposal of cars.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will apply to all vehicles over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo.
In Russia, a similar program of recycling cars has already been in place.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only to dispose of cars for a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one at a discount when handing over the old one to a "trade-in" from the dealer.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million units (plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has become widely known only now.
The inspiration for the game came from events in Ferguson, where there are now protests that began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters like bandits, the police will treat him better and let him go where an ordinary person can not go.
If he covers events differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale riot.
Points in the game will need to be scored with the help of Twitter hero, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos posted there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photo was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media covered the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationships to homophobic parents.
Geletei draws Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
With a call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Geletey draws the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who said about the “completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, the losses of which will be calculated “in the tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page the above-mentioned post, is a subject for research of specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
Ukraine’s defense minister wrote on his Facebook page on Monday: “Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that the “operation to liberate eastern Ukraine” was completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate photos of stars and apologized
Today, the horror has covered more than 60 stars of Hollywood.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data warehouse) in smartphones, after which their intimate photos appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Really, just for a little while.
The official representative of the star of the “Hunger Games” Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her mobile phone, and also confirmed that all the photos that “glow” on the Internet are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the tabloid site of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues in the shop for publishing their candid photos, writes The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do that.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I’m going to delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice,” he wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already spread around the Web.

It happened in Los Angeles at the corner of Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer got rid of the injury and stretching of the muscles of his right hand.
Beckham came out of the tattoo parlor, where the paparazzi were waiting for him.

Tony Stewart suffers an accident, returning to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke on 172 laps, ending his performance.
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
Team Principal Chad Johnston said 14 members of the team are upset but will now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
“I started today with quite a lot of hope to get to the finish line,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the crew gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver while racing on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and he needed to win either in Atlanta or at the next races in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had gone out on the track to express his displeasure with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement agencies said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
The decision as to whether Stewart would be charged was not made.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause when he was introduced before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stewart went into the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then on the 122nd lap after the restart, Bush's number.
Car 18 went off the trajectory at the exit of Turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with cigarettes with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not fail to report on her Instagram.
However, one photo very surprised and very confused fans of the couple.
The photo was taken at Zhvanetsky.
"At breakfast with Mikhail Mikhalych Zhvanetsky Maxim explains what Instagram is:)) #Odessa", - Ksenia Sobchak signed the photo.
There is nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter and everything.
Fans of the couple decided that Ksyusha also smokes, and condemned her for this.
"And whose cigarettes?", "Smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast) "," It's like at breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes)))), "Xenia, you also smoke?" - worried about her favorite subscribers to her blog.
Recall that recently Sobchak boasted about what a delicious dinner for the first time in her life prepared by Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happiness is when you come to the country,and your husband has prepared a dinner for your arrival (for the first time in your married life,so how delicious.The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he did not say the words from the anecdote: "to make it so every day now," - boasted her husband Ksenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxim is preparing something with diligence, and the table has already served pickles and baked chicken.
Bulgarian prison officers hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with Acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the trade union of prison officers repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).

Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the prison workers ' union.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayuth (right) appointed Minister of Defence Pravitt Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and prime minister of Thailand, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of the posts are held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayuth Chan-ocha was formally confirmed as prime minister after the King of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22 was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a session of Parliament.
The army has previously appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Chinawat.
Officially, Prayut Chan-ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the background of complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were provisionally arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army ousted Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taksin as prime minister.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the metropolitan elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the clam salad would be better, I did not promise you this, the waitress from the new Palm brasserie squeals.
It is necessary to formally admit that this is indeed so, but the mind and stomach remain unyielding.
After all, everyone knows for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean the mussels, we say "mussels" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurateurs like to say that the success of a restaurant depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There are places that are not so good, but even great, but some bad luck.
In short, after sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bozhole" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, and Belgian.
Above the ground is only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - TVs where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have long been not new, so there is something to compare.
There are eight types of draft beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottled (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "the mussels are full of large seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, can predict that meat roll with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) - in fact, carpaccio, cut to the same thin that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem to matter ugly thick.
You can feel at least some taste, only if you put together half a plate.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Lezhe (260) would be the most correct to recognize a crime against the Belgian people: some rusty iceberg, boiled once a long time ago potatoes, acidified Kenyan beans, cured bacon chips plus for some reason pickled onions.
With a salad like this, you don't want to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or fried champignons, then why do mussels look as if they have been thawed and boiled several times in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Sauces half a dozen, the one of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not ask.
There are vegetables, and there is no aroma, and whether there was wine there remains a mystery.
But good mussel-based fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken waterza here is not a loaf of bread, thick to such an extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the local rabbit cooks in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
The situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary muffled everything.
It seemed that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful - no, just a delicious pear in a caramelized crust was attached to the rabbit's leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce turned out to be excessively watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table very informally inquired about the dinner impressions.
Then we should come again.
The dollar rose to MICEX above 37 rubles on the news of new sanctions against Russia being prepared by the West.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar, calculated "tomorrow" by 10:29 MSK, grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow Exchange.
Bi-currency basket grew by 28 cents to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pair with the euro and in pair with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine, one way or another, will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market was very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news, yesterday was crossed out.
The week, according to the forecasts of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in one chain.
Inflation is also forecast to accelerate: from 5 to 10% will be added to current prices for autumn.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon run out, and there will be some vacuum as the networks shift to other suppliers.
“The dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no powerful hysteria,” said Konstantin Bushuyev, head of the market analysis department at Otkritie Broker.
It remains to be seen whether the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went to the news in Ukraine, besides, the Central Bank last week said that until the end of the year completely moves to a floating rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, then it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Disturbing times for the currency market were, let me remind you, when at the end of January there was increased demand for the currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
In UFS IC see a positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers due to higher import prices, says UFS IC Chief Analyst Alexei Kozlov.
The negative aspects include the rise in the price of imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause a rise in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX index fell by 1.67% during trading on Thursday, and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions come to naught, and the ruble quotes partially or completely restore the lost positions.
“We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar,” said Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
The British woman said she had spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (SMT), a group of inherited disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that a misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with SMT because so little is known about the condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait and pinched toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release an Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical record when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where it shouldn’t, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this disease because you’d already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you've got something that's a lot less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have SMT.
“When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I drew a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK’s SMT charity has announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The Tax Burden on Washington Zone Entrepreneurs Rises as the Economy Recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose modestly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state treasury and locally in fiscal 2013, a 3.8 percent increase over the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses increased 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when accounts declined, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings in the least amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, tax revenue growth is driven by a return to the previous level of real estate value for companies, the researchers said, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row when growth was less than 1 percent.
While large states such as California, New York and Texas account for a large share of this revenue, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase from the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate value does not have any similar effect on state and local tax revenue growth in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies’ tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to these figures.
Companies in the region declared a state-wide corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has amassed $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although the trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax rate in three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just as it did in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to as high as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurial taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners – the transitional structure under which most small firms are structured – in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much faster rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues at state and local levels up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world championship in judo brought the Russian team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday three medals were won at once.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion in 2011 and 2013 Japanese Masashi Ebinuma.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarter-final stage, walked victoriously through the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg also to the third step of the podium of honor got Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semifinals, she lost to the current world champion Melinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship performed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze Kuzyutina won Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament still admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again the obstacle on the way of the Russian woman to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk bronze in the Russian national team put Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was former Moldovan representative Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov performed at the home championship with ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
It is interesting that another of his compatriots, who took sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko with bronze completed the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg won Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he at the expense of a remark from his opponent defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Kotyarov, and the Russian team this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival of Questova was not able to go to the tatami because of the injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put into the treasury of the national team by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he scored a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judoka won the team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a stubborn struggle with the score of 2-3 lost to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan-Magomedov and volition - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
According to the same scenario, a bronze match in the women's tournament developed, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
“Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions,” Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the home World Cup performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then in the asset of the Russian team there were only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
I want a gold medal.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo", - summed up the results of the tournament, the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, the words of which are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The national team of Japan is expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held in Astana in the summer of next year.

The family of Joan Rivers hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, the Yorkville Endoscopes, sources said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under close surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “severe.”
The response has been broad, including numerous online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All can kings
The debut album of the band Royal Blood is on sale - a new hope of British rock, which brought rock duos from clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo is only a year on stage, but already has a nomination for the BBC Music Award, a tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name a few months before the release received 100 thousand pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duet of bullish-looking Britons playing with the same level of volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the bets on the first album in connection with all the above-mentioned circumstances were especially high and have already fully justified.
The duo did not in vain take a name that before this could encroach only that quite desperate hairy metalworkers, and the blood of which kings flows, as they think, in their veins, is also understandable.
We are talking, of course, first of all about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set out to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise is probably too early, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer’s talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to tune than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock fans, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, quite the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (preferably to be the successors to Mot<0xC3><0xB6>rhead), but have brought numerous rock duets from ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously close.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also about the approach to composing songs.
The heroes of the retrorock of the zeros with great difficulty were chosen beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance went to recognize themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already now sound so powerful and brazen that this strain successfully drapes some of the secondaryness and solidity of the musical material.
After all, who said rock had to be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: An online store — and video producer, and a hundred other things — is buying streaming video service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set a goal to be a general-purpose streaming service – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which omniscients give (mainly, old) games a treat, as in the "Mystery Theater", is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to reports, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
Emmett Shire, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster.
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they’d rather play sports than watch them, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of vision yourself can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about the virtuoso of the game or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How is Amazon going to do that?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch turning into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to have: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
Amazon and Twitch both believe in the future of gaming, and the channel is showing no signs of fading, even as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked with the surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the dead, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mothers of Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation by an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the Department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, working on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with Vyacheslav Bocharov, an officer of the FSB of Russia.
What particularly shocked me during the work on this topic is that in Beslan it was as if these ten years did not exist.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope that we have coped with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics studio of Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
North Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, reports "Renhap".
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, these Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma introduced a draft law that provides for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative base of the lower house.
Its authors were deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to faster and more effective protection of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the safety of personal data and compliance with the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is hastened by parliamentarians, obliges to store in the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of the so-called "black lists" of sites-violators - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the CPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data stores of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom," which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, from the Mail Group, from Western companies that already provide their servers today.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers that are ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems – they will receive technological opportunities for placement,” Levin said.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is adopted, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services of air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the disappearance of global services and significant economic losses.
The participant of the test with a bucket of ice water dislocated the jaw
Isabella Roberts from the UK screamed so much when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of the face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went to the wrong place.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during a test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabella Roberts screamed so fiercely when ice water was poured over her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck,” she told The Mirror.
Water for a 20-year-old.
Isabella Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it wouldn't close, it got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then the same understanding came to my mother and sister and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to straighten her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.

Militants handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The “Army of Novorossiya” claim to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
Militias as of 10:00 on September 1 handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 killed soldiers.
This was reported by "Interfax" the representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossia".
He added that "the air defense forces in the vicinity of the settlement of Mereshki shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the interlocutor of the Agency, the Ukrainian side during the artillery shelling of the Lugansk airport used prohibited by international conventions cluster munitions.
The representative of the press service noted that the militias overnight managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian air force at one of the field airfields, as well as to destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
“Losses in the enemy’s manpower – up to one hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people,” – said the representative of the staff.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side in the framework of the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the “Army of Novorossiya”, “interrupted the attempt of the National Guard in violation of earlier agreements to withdraw heavy equipment from the encirclement area.”
Then the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two IFVs in a short battle, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored combat vehicles, more than 120 people were killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen found themselves surrounded by militias near Ilovaisk in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on the condition that the enemy hands over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the besieged settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the surrounded battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday, 14 more people came out of the "boiler".
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "prisoned at the 137th regiment of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of introduction of new sanctions by the EU
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on “absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,” the ministry said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, succumbs to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties," the ministry said.
There are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, as well as the number of civilian casualties is growing.
We will remind that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the measures introduced with each other by the period of validity and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Smart Ways to Save Money on University Textbooks
With the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be moving into his second year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation so that they would postpone their sale.
“My math analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Council of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often cost significantly less than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, says book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented out during last spring’s semester, says Trevor Meyer, Nibo’s vice president.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book may be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of The Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 at the price list, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the website Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Purchase of used
If you don’t mind other people’s notes or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" sells for $93.49 in secondhand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassady, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the textbook “Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business.”
The book sold for $48.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, are asking students to check with their professors to see if they can use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not essential for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.
Renting
It is worth thinking about renting textbooks if you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them and do not want to keep them after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent “Mathematical Analysis” for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any fines you may be charged for notes, underscores, and damages.
If you are renting a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented, acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
“Mathematical Analysis” on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Galt, 29, who is about to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using an ISBN to find out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering online, says Golt, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was delayed by four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the complete inefficiency of the fund for the development of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on issues of state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
“15 billion rubles and remained on deposits,” – said the President.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve the list of priority development territories in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks to ensure the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form priority development territories that should become competitive with key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
We will remind, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save the box office
Sylvester Stallone’s The Irresistible 3 returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: The Woman Worth Killing for returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
“Home video” with Cameron Diaz brought in just $14.6 million in its first weekend, while children’s movies like “How to Train Your Dragon 2” also disappoint with revenue.
The article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the “worst” year ever in terms of children’s films, and called “How to Train Your Dragon 2” a barely “functioning” sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience a bit older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily consist as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer to at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of films this year is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on a soon-to-be-released Disney movie, The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We need to recognize this and not try to chase after what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in box office receipts in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth to his gloomy predictions.
With several potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic Park, other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in box office fees simply “cyclical,” telling the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, common drink so far prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat low-salt cucumber than bad mozzarella,” laments Italian restaurant chef Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered by suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan stock should last for a couple of months.
What should I do?
Switching to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes, which is clear: shocking memories do not let go of him until now.
The meat was lying on carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day they brought me a sample of fish from the Far East.
It turned out to be a brick!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy are strange for the Russian manufacturer.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must be sagging to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me: where did you get such tender meat?
I said, this is yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do this to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Most" and the bar "Strelka" Director Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, the direction becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Color cabbage - 200 rubles!
I say, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price, it turns out that this is a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
The standard story: "The first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants do not know what will happen to them when the stocks of cheese run out

The sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the use of separate economic measures to ensure Russia’s security, which are mainly called food sanctions.
The country is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and offal from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a charade with suppliers: prices for products have risen, you urgently need to look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, this will affect expensive restaurants with a monokitchen of France, Italy, Spain, to which products were supplied directly from the "mother" countries.
The commonwealth has had to rebuild before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers established beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 were much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
The Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can still be eased.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to Vostok-Zapad, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergei Mironov, restaurateur, owner of the agency “Restconsult”.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it may take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to refuse 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to process.
Restaurants with a mixed kitchen are already starting to replace dishes, such as a steak made of marble beef, with beef Stroganoffs, says Sergey Mironov.
“Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” said Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of Vostok-Zapad.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian went there.
Although it will be difficult for the institutions of the Ginza Project, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace it,” Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones.
But there are also a lot of restaurants, which sanctions will hardly affect.
These include establishments with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,” says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe “Vai Me!”.
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, at the heart of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use. "
In Kolbai establishments, not a single dish has been removed from the menu so far.
Timur Lansky, owner of restaurants "Chaihon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also do not bother: he will have to change only the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia arranges imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS you can get cheaper cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish like that.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olympi Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the request of "Money", also quite calmly respond to sanctions.
The McDonald’s press service said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the department for work with suppliers Subway Russia, about 80% of the network purchases products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctioned products" in general occupied no more than 4%.
Not affected by sanctions and noodle "Vokker".
KFC, Burger King and Piggy Bank did not respond to Money's request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's localization is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hunchback
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
“For products for Grabley, prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio – twice,” says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbay admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork,” said Sergei Rak, deputy CEO of Stardogs.
Chickens are up 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
“It’s not good to raise prices,” says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of general food revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how fast: while most restaurateurs stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the drops in purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the scene, musicians play waltzes.
This is a festival of regional products with a fun name "There is time to eat".
“We were going to celebrate local food for a long time, and here is the sanctions, we rushed, organized a festival,” says one of the organizers.
Behind the scene with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas makes a pasta salad and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on making borscht with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, assure the organizers.
In the tents - an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin Sovkhoz near Moscow, cheeses from the blushing Italian Jay Close.
"Salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East," says the owner of the fish shop "His people" Philip Galkin.
We catch a mink, a cat, a snout, a hunchback, a chavitch - "royal salmon".
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is a type of aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, it doesn't even move.
And you won't be able to hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special complaints agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with a domestic one.
In the window of his tent are shrimps with the tag "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The shop has been operating since 2012, sells fish through an online store, before the introduction of sanctions served another half a dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple things".
Now Galkin received applications from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he is hot.
We sat down and tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation, I'm getting a portion of "Philadelphia" with a cat in Galkin's tent.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to be chewed longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "His people" there are even rolls of halibut and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," - says the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could occupy the vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the project LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit, first of all, the large producers of other countries," Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the substance of the claims made to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants to visitors,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
No one really knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - an employee of a company engaged in restaurant consulting says on the condition of anonymity.
If McDonald’s were to be shut down nationwide, the scenario would be very different.
"Europrotocol" instead of reference traffic police
Casco payments can be obtained without the help of traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance, according to which from September 1 of this year to receive payments on the helmet insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate traffic police.
However, we are talking only about those cases where the accident was formalized according to the "Europrotocol" without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the established limit, and both drivers reached an agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit for payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often, even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be issued according to the "Europrotocol", drivers involved in an accident cause traffic jams.
After all, in the presence of a casco policy, it was impossible to get compensation for it without a certificate from the traffic police.
The parameters spelled out in the draft directive are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum Casco payment in connection with the accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit under the “Europrotocol”.
But at the same time, it can not be higher than the limit specified in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is, of course, useful and theoretically able to unload both DPS employees and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter already now speak of a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules for payments on the Casco.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for an inspector to arrange a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or to convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
The savings certificate will be made nameless and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates for bearer, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates for bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, since the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since it is not necessary to make deductions to the fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his licenses are trying to get money in the ASA.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the agency's practice, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," the agency said.
The problem is, of course, fictitious.
After all, no one will pay buyers of certificates anyway, since they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If the case was that the instrument is not insured in the ACS, along with it would be prohibited and metal accounts, on which the funds of citizens are accounted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one is trying to exist yet.
The fact is most likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-denomination.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing out such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must be a name security, which must be stored in the depository.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early repayment.
That is, an analogue of the irrevocable contribution is introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests from those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what has been described as an anti-summit.
Steven Fairclaw followed the developments over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the terrorist group Islamic State, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, citing a decision taken after a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems “Milan” and 500 charges to them, as well as 8 thousand assault rifles G3 and G36.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Mrs. Merkel will make a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
Until now, Germany has not supplied its weapons to the “hot spots”.
Opinions of the people of Germany about the sending of weapons to Iraq are divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militants destroyed a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoe (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage bushwhackers were taken by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set off for a hike shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search party was dispatched, which included local police and a rescue party, and the pair were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were picked up on a winch Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountain Hospital.
There were two unions
The Minsk summit talks did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian Economic Union.
Although on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who took the cream from this summit.
Questions on this matter fell away in the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and then other Eurasians with Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko in the TV news.
The Belarusian leader set an example of polished politeness, it was the behavior of a man who had just broken the jackpot – and is planning a decent old age in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenka helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just a legitimation of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"The results were achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization," the source said, adding that talks on international security were held with the United States.
The U.S. has lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only spurred this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not withdraw from either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington have noticed Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue – and assessed it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenka’s movement towards political diversification will be, it will be seen by how often Minsk will have to take meetings in the EU+TS format in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maja Kosjan<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> only said "Ogonka" that against the background of resolving the issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
A drop of tar for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that it was, it turns out, personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not against Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” acquires the status of a fully hand-held European leader who helps solve the global problem.
The best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting’s timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the fears of the CU countries on the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement larger than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, said: “EU representatives have come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around.”
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences – and primarily the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, ex-candidate for the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit rushed Minsk.
“The initiators of these schemes,” Romanchuk said, “are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establishing production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the owner of the negotiating platform for the EU and the Customs Union is ideal for Lukashenko in terms of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow’s sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president can offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s authority in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is being rechristened, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
“It was your proposal to gather, without any rush to discuss, not from the bay of Barakhta to make a decision, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time,” he said in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, which is rumored to have initially been against Minsk’s mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is carefully emphasized that Belarus, when organizing the interaction between the EU and the Customs Union on its land, does not pursue selfish goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the sphere of security, the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, puts forward and promotes," Ogonka was told in the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, the department where recently scrupulously selected words.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, M24.ru reports with reference to the deputy mayor of Moscow on transport issues Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has successfully proven itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, see all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made on this matter,” Liksutov said.
Zammera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workload to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all the traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient infrastructure for the detour, then it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy mayor said.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
We will remind, on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin participated in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Sinful boredom
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez’s film “The City of Sins 2: A Woman Worth Killing” made quite a revolution that could not be expected from him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the “thesis-antithesis-synthesis” chain, which is fundamental to modern thinking (if we understand the Noir universe by the thesis, and the antithesis by the comic book space by the thesis).
From now on, it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
Sin City 2 is chaotic at both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, behold, the thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to snatch - in the role of such a folk bandit - from the air knives and other axes with muzzles.
But the old people are literally pushed with their elbows by newcomers, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly torn apart by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His - the lusty-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, in the face can not be distinguished from Johnny - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are endured with unrelenting regularity - is not a misfortune or even half a misfortune.
These are not people, we understand that these are noir archetypes: a fateful bitch, too confident a player who fell into the "honey trap" of sex detective, a corrupt vampire senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and chases the archetype, then this is no longer a movie, but rather an abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
And even in this troubled world, there is something permanent.
The war whores of the first "City" still keep a circular defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
Yes, and the ghost of detective Hartigan no-no, and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem of the "City of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good that as a draftsman talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director - turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposed "reality".
The phenomenon of the comic in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time when the novels of Dashil Hammett "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of noir, which was then called hard-boiled school - "cool school".
Well, or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popeye - the eater of spinach, giving him the heroic power, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "avengers".
But in any movie based on comics, there was something wrong: the cartoon characters stubbornly did not want to overgrow the screen flesh, remained pretenders in the "real" world around them by will-slavery.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of “existence.”
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsythes, what Thibauts and Rugon-McCaras, what Bolkons and Rostovs are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of a soap opera, and the criminal - that is, by definition, marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned from his skin what it was like to work as a paramedic at the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, there were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Losey, Edward Dmytric.
Therefore, noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is hardly an American version of socialist realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically combined the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a “real” film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the killings and the senator covered the monstrous son-sadist, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And picturesque details such as the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of the neonuar.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodriguez's radical stylistics to the comic book tradition.
This is largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside which the snow falls on a toy cloak.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody shrapnel, but by and large, what difference does it make?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return the girl who went down the wrong path or, say, tell inconsolable parents that her killer is punished.
When there is no place for sin in the city, there is no sin but sin, and sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring as any norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is simply boring.
For the sake of justice, domestic hire gave this fresh sin a small, but spicy.
The captions warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken by tongs, this gives a hell of a sense of humor.
Hammett would have loved it.
France's Socialists should "shut up and put France in order", says key ally of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande
Mr Wall called on the deeply divided left to “demonstrate a warm attitude” towards the attacking socialist president, whose reshuffles have not been approved by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves respect from everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It is our duty to stay close to him,” he said, drawing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the conflict-inflaming proposals, it should loosen the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande pleaded with his Socialist Party comrades to remain “united” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future”.
Marine Le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, has expressed disdain for the Socialists’ ongoing internal conflicts, saying she has no idea that Wall’s new government will last longer than a few months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is the naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last even a summer.
"And the new one will not last in autumn or winter either," Ms Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for parliament to be dissolved, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France’s ruling party suffered defeat in March’s municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions by the end of Hollande’s 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Xianz Poe, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He doesn’t have much time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could become even worse.
“City Without Drugs” is not a crime.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional Ministry of State Property Management to the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The agency intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the Fund "City without Drugs" (one of the founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice did not appear in court, which is why it was decided to refuse consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the directorate of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
Representatives of the Fund were also unable to be contacted.
We will remind, we are talking about the mansion, which occupied the fund in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 on a gratuitous basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency required through the court to recognize the non-concluded contract of gratuitous use of the premises of the mansion-monument.
According to the directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not include significant conditions for renting a cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Perm Arbitration Court, which was satisfied.
The Foundation then filed a cassation appeal against this decision in the same court, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Foundation in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, according to which the fund again began to pay rent, this was told by the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman.
The rent was set at 300,000 rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided otherwise,” he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, Yekaterinburg City Duma Deputy United Russia Alexander Kosintsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city Duma Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against Oleg Kinev, a deputy of the Gordum, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a pensioner, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Eugene Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "defamation" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, General Director of the Legal Center "Protection", addressed with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog entries that she was involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone to be turned into a wallet
Ahead of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are more and more leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
According to sources, the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 smartphone will have a mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves declined to comment on the matter.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the checkout of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user’s fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first built-in technology NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make a contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the checkout.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
NFC was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies involved in the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote the technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: the position of Paris regarding the supply of Mistrals to Russia does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said that Paris's position on the supply of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia has not changed.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande) in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not of France," Nadal was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign Ministry answered the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

At the end of the operation, data on losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
Those responsible for such a situation will be held accountable,” added Mr. Lysenko, refusing to discuss the situation near Ilovaisk in more detail, where several Ukrainian battalions were encircled.
According to the representative of the NSDC, "everything is being done to return the servicemen who were captured," ITAR-TASS reports.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military moved away from the airport of Lugansk in the direction of the village of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, with access to luxury cruise ships and luxury clients of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked not to be named, as the talks are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a representative of Apollo declined to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from middle-class growth in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Competitors seek to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became a major shareholder in the company after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment conglomerate and casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company, as of the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of the cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to the registration documents for the first public offering of Prestige Cruises shares.
TV and radio company "Crimea" may receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the state television and radio company "Crimea" in 2014.
As follows from the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, posted on the single portal of disclosure of information on the preparation of regulations, it is planned to spend subsidies "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea."
Also, the money will be spent on the purchase of equipment, repair of the roof and power supply systems in the building of the TV and radio company, founded in 1959, RIA Novosti reports.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists disrupt Chinese representative's speech a day after election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday determined a procedure by which only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the 2017 election of Hong Kong’s leader.
All candidates must first gain the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has forced activists of the democratic movement to once again promise to stop the financial center of Hong Kong with protests "Occupy Central".
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong, in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business center and staged a sit-in.
The Lee briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government building in the afternoon.
The UK did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150-year colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is due to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative management in the West Bank.
According to Saeb Ariqat, a representative of the Gaza Strip, the world community should call Israel to account for “continued settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin calls on Kiev to start talks on “statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region an opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start talks with pro-Russian rebels as equals was consistent with the obvious strategy he has pursued since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly-declared territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run First Channel, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military campaign to retake separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently named the seized territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and as government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a “captive of illusions.”
“We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not an issue for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention by a Kremlin spokesman to correct a “misinterpretation” of Putin’s words underscored the Russian leadership’s decision to behave toward the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the outright seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for staying inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, effectively handing the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main military fleet, as well as commercial maritime establishments and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers weigh amendments to the constitution after the new elections, allowing the breakaway regions more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whom Moscow accuses of arming and inciting.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed renewed insurgent offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far away as Crimea.
This entailed large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for drawing up a draft of tougher sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the separatists in difficulty, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with the hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos, which depict naked Jennifer Lawrence, hit the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this, there are about 60 candid photos of the star of the "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly had photos stolen as a result of the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who made Greco an offer last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “shameful” and that those targeted “feel they have been invaded.”
The hacker allegedly has 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by the pool with her breasts exposed.
Palmer's work in the film includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Strahovsky and the actress from the "Forbidden Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ: “This is a brazen invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, is no different from selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been due to a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario of events described resource The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in the language Python, which allowed you to select passwords for the Find My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
It uses the same Apple ID username and password as the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the search method to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all kinds of character combinations are entered sequentially, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service the number of entered password options is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user of the hacking attempt.
Because of the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to find a password for their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a message from a user of Hackapp on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written for it to pick up passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the account of “stars”.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared foreign records
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has previously been a wave of malicious activity using this service.
Hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.

Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian pentathlon
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of modern pentathlon with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the national team of the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in the personal championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
It holds the leading position in the current season.
According to the rules, to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to get special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world in blitz (2010) and fast chess (2014).

TFR stopped the investigation of the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) has terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the crash was the increased speed of approach to the landing, the failure of the crew to comply with standard procedures on landing, as well as the unintentional output of the engines to increased direct thrust.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline, which was on the flight Prague - Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 during landing at the Moscow Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled over the runway and caught fire.
At the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the co-pilot and the flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to medical facilities, where they later died from their injuries.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with serious injuries, were undergoing long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, moving at the time of the crash on the Kiev highway, was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transport prosecutor’s office after the disaster conducted an inspection in the Red Wings, during which numerous violations were identified.
In February 2013, the airline’s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion
Angry facial expression is biologically universal for mankind, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States found.
About their discoveries, they told in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release of the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - shifted and lowered eyebrows, stretched in a thin line of lips, bloated nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, notes the study's lead author Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion arose for the effective conduct of disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his conditions, and he conveys this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmation of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and go to the handicraft, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions unfavorable for them to others, and also prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Starting from the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining”, the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups, creating an angry expression of the face, should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus force as soon as possible to agree to his conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated faces on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry face was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or forward chin separately did not make the face angry, the physically stronger person depicted with such features, the study participants unanimously recognized.
Man’s anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own strength, forcing him to agree and obey.
A person inflates his nostrils and squeezes his lips with the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that demonstrates its fangs.
Anger is “triggered” by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite party the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tubby.
