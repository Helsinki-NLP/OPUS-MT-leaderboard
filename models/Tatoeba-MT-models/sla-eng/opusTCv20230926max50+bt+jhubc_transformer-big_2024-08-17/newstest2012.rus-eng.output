The Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to cancel the article according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on commuting sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia that was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the sentence is political revenge on the regime; in the West, the process is also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, which we have already heard about.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and which we would hardly wish for ourselves.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind, nor the best, and probably would not suit, for example, the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, the NATO raids were led not by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each blow.
And if there are winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "crusaders".
Without occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold at virtually no cost?
Most likely, they will not get. And then the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of the Shari'ah put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are now in the spotlight of investors.
A statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, Germany and France are showing growth.
Today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany did better than expected (growth by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (initial information assumed stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts' forecasts.
Greece’s economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 percent.
The yield on both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4%.
In Germany, they say that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech national team has been selected in the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1: 0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Petr Jiracek, they won with a score of 1: 0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant advantage after the home rematch, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the progress of the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, in part due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jiracek; won 1–0 in Montenegro and celebrates their entry into the European Championship.
Excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87> became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr Cech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game was played most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first half. Long-range strikes behind the line of defense were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In this way, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
At noon on Tuesday, the prayers of the students at the entrance to the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to defend their country's nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) pointed out that everything indicates that Iran has not abandoned attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
At noon on Tuesday, the prayers of students at the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of Iran’s nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is taking place.
Nutrition for children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than normal; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families leading an unhealthy lifestyle.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the behaviors that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children who have a normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate French fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports. This, however, applies to most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
The study included 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year and involved nearly 900 elementary school students across Bohemia.
The Obesity event was not an accident held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company V<0xC5><0xA1>eobecná zdravstvo poji<0xC5><0xA1>t'ovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand schoolchildren-students of grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise are the main determining factors causing a rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five times a day, according to the scheme of breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner, and this is one of the indispensable conditions for proper nutrition,” says one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even such relative details as the constant time of a family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school children eat breakfast together.
Most families eat breakfast separately.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family people do not eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study showed that fried food is more often consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sugary soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly play sports, this figure is reduced by more than half - up to 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
“Food preferences in Czech children aged 12-15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“The great popularity of sugary soft drinks is a particular concern,” the study concluded.
As the main lunch dish, the pasta defeated the bird with a slight advantage.
However, the children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetable dishes.
Striving for a healthy lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the control group of the study showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when filling out the questionnaire after the end of the lecture Obesity is not an accident,” says the project results.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sugary soft drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children more often noted poultry and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about training for stylists, I complained about the amount of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; advice on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
Further - more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there is not a single man on the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boyish figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than the norm.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of such women as Jennifer Lopez, i.e. the owners of a more lush chest and thighs and a narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and hips is so large that you can not pick up a skirt or trousers, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will definitely not regret the invested funds, because ideally sitting clothes are priceless.
In a skirt made to order, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, rolls, exposes the waist, etc.
Holders of boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffles, appliques, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week to realize all this.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each participant of the course had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I have to dress Miranda Kerr, which you may know from Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m happy for myself, because it’s much easier to dress her than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
The Mudboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic component of the style.
The stylist does not just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, for example, fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But that was only on Sunday.
Stylists need general knowledge.
Saturday's lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist knows how to use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, over jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without fasteners, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up your sleeves or raise your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice most of all: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,” Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we collect all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see quite another.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I learned that a stylist should have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others quite differently than in reality.
We have to keep this in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often the image and style is half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have amazing vocals, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often think this is unnecessary (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and the way they look is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to name us a different (smaller) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about the fact that some celebrity has lost weight / lost weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up an outfit.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them and stick to their opinions.
“If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few nice things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a work bag should fit.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, for example, a bag or hat), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (pencils and similar items are prohibited because they spoil the clothes) or a set.
To distract from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned how to make linings on the soles of shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged – not to mention shooting outdoors.
So, we got into gluing.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors, so as not to spoil them.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
These skills did not appeal to me.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t as easy as it sounds.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
<0xD0><0xA1>ompany
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute due to a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were met to a certain extent, but it didn’t matter, because no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Escape" associated with high hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would take a worthy place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the protagonist gets out of the car and runs away.
As is often the case with NFS, the end result is very different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in fact, these are not mistakes, but a manifestation of inexplicable laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of a story, the main character of which, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
It doesn’t feel like the same thing is happening in the game all the time.
Despite the fact that the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to look at.
And yet the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race is revived from time to time by an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under an avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to outrun a few opponents (essentially a regular race); then you try to improve time (a standard race with a stopwatch); or you compete against one opponent.
Among other things, you occasionally run into the police, which further complicates your task.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out to be good for the game, because this property is not boring; given all of the above, it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you are looking for an imitation of real life, you will have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although you can find better options on the market.
So far, so good.
After a while, however, the problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game do not expect complex transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before the collision with the object, how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, overtaking or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes slightly touch another car. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car begins to spin furiously.
Or smashed to bits.
This is not so important thanks to the restart system, but it is enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you break or go far away from the track, the game returns you to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be made in a certain way, otherwise you simply will not fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you either need to go around them or slow down.
It doesn’t matter when you’re around them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Rivals have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand up to you no matter what.
The fact is that when it drives in front of you, it degrades your view, leading to one or more accidents at that site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
Too bad, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so eventful that you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what doesn’t make you bored – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to track the filling stations along the way, because it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for straight stretches of highway; and exotic super-athletes for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain trails.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual sections that you will learn as the game progresses.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to the challenges and story modes.
Many options are available for obtaining a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another flaw that’s hard to understand; it’s an example from the last race in a row.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (we’ll assume so) where you’re racing on rails in the dark (we’ll assume so).
Your speedometer shows the figures from 150 to 200 km/h (let’s assume so), when suddenly a subway train flies at you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editors discussed whether no one really thought for a second during the creation of the game, or its creators really consider us such fools.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video sequence is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that in some critical moments the quality of recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This is especially true for events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
To cater to as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack 'included compositions from different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is pretty messy.
If the game had avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of the NFS over the past few years.
Either way, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, this is good entertainment, but be prepared for the fact that the shortcomings will blind you as an airport searchlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
The Czechs have a reputation of ill-wishers and skeptics in relation to the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organisations.”
"I didn't expect there would be such a brutal war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation somehow stabilizes, calms down and all the players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova rigidly began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adheres to her motto “Clearly and openly about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relations between them so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the KU Faculty of Law would envy.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary grey office mouse who couldn’t play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role.”
“He is a man who can listen to the 27 member states at the same time, who is great to communicate with and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? By what number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheese.
Vicenova further focused on a programme that is key for the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success last year.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame that crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at that time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused an ongoing ferment.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will receive less; all these issues are in the upcoming program.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans that she brought to Brussels: “On Europe, Intelligible Language”.
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our varieties of cheese.
It is also going to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with a little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, ‘Hey, what’s up with the Visegrad group again?’ and he’s not happy about it.”
In the future, the Vicenova Union expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, she sees the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe as more realistic.
“We have both countries inside and outside the eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it has been said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t, can stay away.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member states, not just eurozone members.
History of the brand:
The innovator IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses IMB’s strategy, the closest is likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The longevity of the company was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan “Think!” thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of its internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
For the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” says the current head of the company Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of caring for employees in the same way as Bata in the Czech Republic – IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a sophisticated bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same is true of IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application for talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it an excellent choice.
Agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorming, during which many future innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are a lot of ideas - about half a million people work in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
The company’s strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM was an organization rather than a technology company in terms of concept,” said Rosabet Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Forrester Research’s J. Colony.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the “Blue Giant,” as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that this is the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of $220 billion, IBM has become the second-largest technology company this year, ahead of Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all of its products were to the liking of customers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; the online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is driven by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the groundwork on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it abandons them.
This is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing a crash on Windows, its operating system.
Promising technology
IBM’s core revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with a capital of half, it was the strongest company-manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion. At the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net earnings have been constantly growing.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, we can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM's history: from cheese knife to spaceflight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Corporation of calculation, tabulation, recording" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Initially, the brand was called so, used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the legendary “table clock”, i.e. a clock that records the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also headed the board of trustees of the company.
Flint hired the director of a rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the head pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an inviolable corporate culture and personality.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, started with the production and sale of various equipment for business - from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company’s large-scale expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly forty years later his seat as director was taken by his son, Thomas Watson, Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control the space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computers to a Chinese company, Lenovo, while buying the consulting division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
The IBM tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where also operates a world-class research group engaged in speech recognition.
The story of her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, save the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said that it's over!
After her husband Josef Richtarz (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has outlined clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Richtarzhova explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided Bartoshova’s roof in her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Iveta to leave Rzhichan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
In fact, he has publicly admitted that he loves her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to be reconciled to her husband’s romance; and now she has finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if one day Richtarch and Bartoshova part, his wife will not accept him with open arms.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out.”
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom I have something in common," said Richtarzhova, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against the fact that his wife rejected him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union is still functioning; I am in charge of repair, garden, home and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, except we don’t share a bed anymore,” Richtarch told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I take full responsibility.”
The Worst Habits of Women: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines describing a few female habits that make men angry?
SHOPPING
Does your partner complain that you are constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one item every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who among you will refuse to go shopping for clothes in search of perfectly sitting clothes and try on it (preferably in different colors) in the fitting?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait for you outside...
Perpetual Discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Are you familiar with these phrases?
- Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men literally become allergic to the constant complaints of their partner on their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more often such complaints arise, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Washing glasses, vacuuming, washing the floor, dusting, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the living room window glass that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this “deviation,” try to realize that it is not good to go to extremes; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not come first.
A harmless pursuit of purity can threaten your relationships, as well as the whole family.
The desire to command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet crockery towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps, if men understood this, women would not have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women enjoy gossiping, insulting, and plotting against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, I guess we all gossip.
Let’s be honest, that seems to be the nature of all women.
Be that as it may, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women's work collective, pose a great danger to their environment.
The effective transmission of Yagr and Vorachek helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL game on Monday, two performances by hockey forward Jaromir Jagr helped Philadelphia win 5-3 on the Carolina ice. He again became the most productive Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player of the match.
Two successful transmissions of the match also belonged to Yakub Vorachek, who played in the same team with Yagra.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he was predicting a great evening for Giroud.
"I told him before the match that he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Jagr explained, after whose actions Giroud scored the goal at the first opportunity that the Flyers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech trace".
Closing Hurricanes Vorachek took possession of the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap in numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half again led the Flyers.
Especially fat.
After Yagr's performance, he scored a third goal; his shot was later converted to a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely in the top three,” Jagr said, praising his centre-back.
“I never thought at the end of my career I would be playing with a hockey player like him.
“That makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
“All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” Yagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who widened the gap to two points.
“Pronger did a great job in our area.”
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far end."
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked," Vorachek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defender Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not finish the game against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an upper body injury.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 2–3 after a penalty shootout.
Tomasz Plekanec could not score during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
“We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“Anyway, there’s nothing we can do about it, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
“Replacement by replacement, it was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
“We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone.”
"What was our weakness," added the defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0xBE>ej Pavelec helped the Winnipegs beat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted a five-game series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
The dynamics of prices for travel since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists went on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was required; otherwise an individual trip was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered travel to the West, but had to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have “good friends” in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency authorization was necessary for travel to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit, it was impossible to obtain cash (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often, Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit persists to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While prior to 1989, holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we are no longer aware of, is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia today, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to the neighboring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This marked the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at that time was not enough for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (canned food, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech koruna. Decades later, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income increased, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air travel has now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order bulk discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in 2000. Great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Thus, our country has permanently joined the most developed countries of the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand crowns per person during their vacation abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The general assembly must elect a president, the threat of a pat comes back
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which electoral rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Patslik are eager to lead Czech football.
Haszek resigned from his post in June. As he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
However, the Hasheka era has once again plunged football into a rift between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
It became quite obvious on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
Delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, in vain, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials who had been granted powers.
This point has since been partially settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been very helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly concerned with this issue.
Views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the pat?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or find another model,” says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s vice presidents, who represents professional football in the association’s management.
Based on the model provided by the Charter, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received great support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agrees to a compromise - to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the overall percentage the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the votes.
"Nevertheless, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of two chambers," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to the existing rules.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomasz Paczlik agrees with his opinion, although according to the estimates of the election rules defined by the charter, Pelta is more satisfied than other candidates.
“I would like the election to be held as much as possible according to the statute.”
"I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense, as at the previous general meeting," says owner Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements he was basically contradicting Pelte.
Pelt is an optimist.
He believed that the new president would become known in Nimburk; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
“All the emotional ferment will calm down after today’s expected entry of the national team to the European Championship.”
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says a representative of Jablonec. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more reserved.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous.”
“This is not between representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules.”
"This could cause another disruption to the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, some negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was supposed to deliver, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucheru and Reichl to Podgorica, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the venue of the replay match.
After all, the ministerial-level meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobes, would like the opposing sides in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new directorate of Czech sport after Sazka’s financial problems.
Paclik enters the presidential struggle because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of football Plze<0xC5><0x88> Tomasz Paczlik saw a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high position.
“If I was a good candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight.”
“But such a person has not yet been found,” said Patslik <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Patzlik’s motive for joining the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from joining the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R administration.
Moreover, Patslik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be taken by an experienced top manager, not too tied to football life.
“I’ve talked to a few people I could think of.”
“It was horrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to have anything to do with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
Currently, the main disagreement between Patzlik and Pelta is connected with the latter’s relationship with Roman Burb, the president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Burb is a man of controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the votes of delegates of the general assembly.
Patslik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
“If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward.”
“With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football,” Patslick said.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was recorded while tapping phones in a corruption investigation; Pelta managed to avoid a conviction.
“I don’t know what kind of prestige a Pelt victory would bring to football.”
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patslik. He now does not mention his previous statement that he will "sell the club Plze<0xC5><0x88> if Pelta becomes president".
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he could imagine working with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik backed ahead of a general meeting in September that ended in a fiasco.
“He [Pelta] would be the first person I would turn to.”
'He's very capable.'
"I can imagine him at the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
“I don’t have a nose for what I don’t understand either,” said Patslik, who gained a lot of attention in September when he backed the removal of the referee team led by Ludek Matsela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patslick claims he will risk running the association.
He refers to his experience managing private companies; since last summer he has been managing the Plze<0xC5><0x88> team, which with his help celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to disgusting situations," said Patslik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzetinski.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level for the allocation of more money for sports from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president should address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Patslik does not consider his association with the Plze<0xC5><0x88> club a burden, although he argues that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R president should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with Prague’s Dukla.
“It’s not the ideal option.”
“And yet I don’t see the point in hypocritically transferring my Plze<0xC5><0x88> club shares to someone else, since I’m going to be back there in six months,” says Patslick.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will avoid Election Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules in order to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Prior to Thursday’s talks in Nymburk, Jablonec remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election campaign will significantly distract from today’s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting. The two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas on football in a wider context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time and they expect the president to become famous on Thursday.”
“They feel that now is the right time for someone to lead the association,” says a man mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at a general meeting in June.
“If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
He referred to the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false goal for delegates.
“If I become president, I will take it personally and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” says Pelta.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to stand out from the competition.
In the past, he had said he could present his cooperation with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, whom he valued for his legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's had some success.
“However, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign.”
"More and therefore some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims to be true to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent all football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the Bohemians or the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“I would immediately focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all of football,” the 46-year-old candidate told CTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not entail the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual employees." This was his message to Insurance, where a prolonged period of inter-power causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that on Thursday the delegates will come to Nimburk not in vain.
“If the only contentious issue is how to hold an election in the third round, we can handle it.”
“Football needs the trust that it can only gain by finally electing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before a key day in his career as a functionary.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, the FACR will begin to actively work
If Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, the current vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association at Thursday’s meeting, many people in the Association are rumored to be unhappy.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, there will be a time of hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas in football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and youth football events.
“I don’t want to say that I will do everything myself,” Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute authority on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I will carefully allocate the tasks so that in each of these segments football takes big steps forward.”
“It probably won’t appeal to a lot of people, because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I won’t be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move,” he explained his doubts.
“However, a lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others would come.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t throw away,” he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gasek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to cross that off.”
“There have been processes that can bring results in a few years and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association may return to the one that was before Hasek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something that Mirek Pelta is hardly competent at.”
“He’s surrounded by people who would play football in a way that would only be accessible to the chosen ones.”
“I can be accused of many things, but certainly not of subjectivity.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority,” Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“Although many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Plze<0xC5><0x88> club manager Tomasz Paczlik entered the presidential fight, Reichl did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. His successes include saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiating contracts with television and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was “excluded from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football”, he considers another rival, Pácslik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Hasek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
“He wouldn’t distort the facts for his own benefit,” Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try on the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a city tour or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Iris Mader could not do without one thing during her research trips of the last year and a half: without her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubim waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
She hurried to add every pool she liked to her notebook—with important details about the building’s construction and history.
Architectural historian Meder has visited more than 200 swimming pools – and now has gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Swimming), which includes everything from public pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Taunus.
Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only drawback is that swimming fans have to put up with the blue tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the alluring smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the refined oils in the sauna – the wellness factor in the baths is so significant because, according to Meder, all the feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
“The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and springboards.
The 190-page illustrated edition of The Joys of Swimming contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases – and makes you want to jump into the water.
Meder, a collector of water bodies, discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolc) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálf<0xC3><0xBC>rd<0xC3><0xB6> in Jasberen), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old bathhouse.
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning view. You can see the whole Zurich from the rooftop swimming pool or view the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And the steam room has a window that allows you to see what is happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits bathers in Langenfeld. The water cathedral in <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rises from it, which seem very small against the background of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Mountains.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The collector of pools Meder not in every pool met the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell of gray. Baths named after Arpad in Beke<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ab so strongly smell of oil that it can be difficult for you to believe that you are in a health resort.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbonates in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the sludge that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool – a wellness experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots. When she tried to visit the outdoor swimming pool of the Czech Baths in Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she found the area sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x87> in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the spectacular views of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in the Black Forest - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will find not only the neo-Romanesque elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of pool expert Iris Meder – and not only because she is originally from the Black Forest.
“It’s a real achievement to masterfully combine such different architectural styles,” says Meder.
Diving into the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary activity.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Thieves
Will Deutsche Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann tasked the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world’s poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of those polled are demanding that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that betting on the world’s commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus implicated in world hunger.
The consumer campaign is aimed directly at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although major banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
Initially, rates on goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and profit at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism. He promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation is due to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank’s board of directors – with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that will follow the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decrease or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "Betting on rising food prices is a blatant example of how thoughtlessly banks are now acting against the common interest."
As the bank’s chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“Deutsche Bank should remove from the portfolio all investments that make money rates on food prices,” said Bode.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as planned.
Repeal of the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not need to worry about expenses - his successor will have to deal with the consequences.
Every second person would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take specific steps if they found their bank involved in such trading. According to the study, every second would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to speculation in goods.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Winsowski
An architectural story with ups, downs and a happy ending. Austria’s pavilion for the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
It is now being re-opened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, bold ones that expressed faith in technological progress.
The Schwantzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its light, soaring steel and glass construction.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, he became famous worldwide in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister - a building in the shape of a bowl.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, transformed and opened as a 20th-century museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which works of art could be hung, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna was given a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001 and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Kriszanitz has restored the pavilion, which has been called the “House of the 21st Century” and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in every sense a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and curators to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and made a decision to donate.
The new museum was to accommodate the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of Josef Olbrich's Vienna Secession, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwantzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him, where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the challenges facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last perestroika were much more serious. The building was an “energy absorber,” says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, a fiberglass-reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel beams of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, the fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting – a virtually new building, but still an elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this with strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum management,” says Krishanitz, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, challenges and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the Brussels Pavilion was rough – a typical “drops in the city” story.
Such an architecture is "always out of place" and nevertheless wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st century house is in a very right place, because when planning the city there was an unexpected luck. A completely redesigned "main station quarter" with offices and residential real estate is growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The 21st century house can be supplemented by a second Krishanitz building – collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly in talks with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans multi-million winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled an anti-crisis plan to avoid train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Citing Deutsche Bahn’s domestic anti-crisis plan, the Bild newspaper reports that investments totaling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
The investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in clearing snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before starting work and 90 percent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves at the time of the worsening weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have waited years for approval from the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check the axes of ICE trains much more frequently over the years after one of the ICE trains broke its axle at Cologne’s main station.
Deutsche Bank will pay many millions of pounds in fines in the United States
New troubles followed the unrest around Joseph Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the US of many millions of pounds.
Like Deutsche Bank had few problems at home, the past of the US industrial giant has now caught up with it. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
“We are pleased to have resolved this issue without the parties having to go to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting to compensate for losses that spill out into the billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 a bubble burst in the real estate market in the United States.
American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live long in September 2008 on the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the U.S. are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have put forward a large number of claims, demanding to pay compensation or punish fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the biggest wave of claims.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of buying about $200 billion worth of collateral from American credit institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also facing prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for the “substantial losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to contest them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Until now, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, since their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was regarded as a chivalrous act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now been given the title of “Sir IBM.”
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March, he has purchased IBM shares for a total of $ 10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest holders of shares of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He praised the management, who managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said, referring to management strategy.
IBM has spent considerable time focusing on high-yield IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in rail freight, in the production of lubricants and in mechanical engineering.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns stakes in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and with the help of skillful investments built on its basis one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct for making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
IBM’s stock price rose 1 percent before markets opened after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of the “cell in Zwickau”, the Turkish media began to doubt the rule of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears. Such right-wing extremist attacks on the Turks have not been since the arson attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"Reviving a Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of an online version of Turkey's Haberturk newspaper.
Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. "Gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet also did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column by Ahmet Kylakhji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The police’s conduct and subsequent successful raids have been sharply criticized on German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before about following suspicious individuals in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsily, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defense."
“That would be the best defense.”
“The world in Germany depends very much on how the whole network is opened and on the legality of the punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s were an example of peace in Germany being threatened.
The photo of the burned ruins in Solingen is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks who live here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time mainly condemned the failures of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellen.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Solingen, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech, counting the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany.
It is as if he determined the value of a man by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
The banking scandal at Lake Zurich
Most of the leading risky policies of European banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one crisis or another ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Weber probably did not suspect that he would get this role.
In July, after his spectacular resignation from the post of the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he will begin work in an equally spectacular position - the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
“UBS has managed to change for the better.”
“I’m looking forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.”
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS board of directors is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take the post of chairman of the council in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that he had long deserved the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe.”
UBS, on the one hand, is very big - until recently it managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other - for years does not get out of scandals.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and persistent, but at the same time dexterous asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become a major player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money in the management of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
and as an investment bank entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Banking, explains: “I have always cited my UBS students as a model of a good bank.”
“Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong.”
He was really very wrong.
It wasn’t until 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley – who was considered an outstanding intellectual and an equally brilliant banker – abruptly stepped down from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment division of the bank tried to play on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported a 13 billion Swiss franc capital increase to counter the crisis.
The bank did manage to find investors – but investors that many bankers would have politely declined to do so until recently – one very opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that even its name was not disclosed.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, the second-highest-paid chairman of Switzerland’s board of directors in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster struck. Due to the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was threatened with collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an undisclosed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks had settled in a small country.
After all, UBS’s total balance sheet in 2007 was five times larger than all of Switzerland’s output (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to hand over the data of wealthy clients who may have been tax evaders with the bank’s help.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS has thus more or less admitted that it was a tool for tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich clients – the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors have since resigned, and
The exodus of customer money has begun.
Within a few months, the bank had lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - in investing due to failed speculation and in asset management as a result of aid and promotion of tax evasion.
And only everything calmed down and it began to seem that UBS managed to turn the tide, as happened this disaster with the swindler-trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment department does not work yet.
“The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The CFO of one of Germany’s largest banks has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk-control tool.”
It was caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but a security for money, whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine republic or not.
Safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still matches the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only it is a little larger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on the Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli, you can find jewelry companies such as Tiffany's here.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls there are large leather sofas. Next to the bank emblem is a large "Safe" sign.
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point gave up Swiss notions of banking — or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn’t want to see his name in the paper – like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big – in particular, in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, it means that they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it its first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungle of subprime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hessig in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger – and a bank that continued to grow.
This was helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but powerful bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, CEO of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always believed that Wolffley and Ospel are a dream team,” said Hans Geiger, a banking analyst.
“Wolffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel, with his inner instinct, went all the way up, starting with an intern at a bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Woolfley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember meetings of board members, at which Woolfley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "tournament table", where the successes of banks were made.
UBS wanted to get to the very top of this table.
He was able to make part of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness. According to the parameter, which in banking terminology is called "constant income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To plug the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank and its hedge fund invested in U.S. subprime securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that pooled securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them further – while continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to get the bank in order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have turned into a children's game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
To anyone who will lead this huge bank, there is an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Banking analyst Geiger already has an idea - to abandon investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about their Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go that far.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that investment activities need to be significantly narrowed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually seen only as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grubel.
Over the past time, he has managed to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It will cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
Axel Weber is probably asking himself these questions.
Publicly, he has only said so far that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe drag down the US stock exchange
The looming recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the change of government in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full rather than half empty — but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 12.078, down 0.6 percent.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down 1 percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.
Statistics Eurostat reported that in September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
This message has thrown American investors into skepticism. "We are not on the island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said Europe was unlikely to shake off a recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns. In an interview with CNBC, he said that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten-year-old principle into the trash can and invested in America’s high-tech industry.
His investments in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the price of shares of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
Shares closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The price of shares of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank into cash, raising $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its capital quota with net sales profit to meet tighter regulations.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing won by cutting losses on the Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 series aircraft for a total cost of $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 aircraft, the total is actually $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
Shares of 630 companies ended trading with growth, 1913 with a fall and 82 remained at the same level on the Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart Crows Fill Cities
Graci are considered problem birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to drive out of cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise are becoming more and more in many settlements.
The problem of birds, however, is far from being solved.
At the first symposium on crows, in the city of Ler in East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to expel gracs from cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected gracs, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting down of traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Jever, Dipholz, Achim near Bremen and Lera there are large colonies, numbering more than 600 parent pairs.
A controversial project to shoot ravens in Lera caused disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics have described trapping birds and cramming them with sticks as particularly cruel.
“Normal movement and scaring do not give anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lehr.
Knocking down nests with a jet of water or felling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
“Animals disperse and large colonies divide and spread to other areas.”
Scaring is possible only in the form of an exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang K<0xC3><0xB6>lner.
A combination of deterring birds from needing protection in residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of chainsaws" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in order to live with this problem."
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very clever ogres.
The project is already attracting tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion about complaints about the noise made by birds. "Noise conveys a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and ingenuity of these birds have entered the legends. Gracchi often not only use tools to capture the bit that they like, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of a bird’s mind on four peas.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that you need to knock on the board to get a moth larva.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the plank.
In another experiment, clever players had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket of moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make the hooks and used the hooks to hook the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players managed to do it on the first try.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks to win at the last minute were long gone.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took last places in the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfectly formalizing its fifth entry into the Euro after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against the outsider of Montenegro after a net victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0-0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored a score of 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Poshtiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former professional Bundesliga player from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovi<0xC4><0x87> and captain Emir Spahi<0xC4><0x87> reduced the difference of two points thanks to a penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Luli<0xC4><0x87> received his second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
Portugal made an excellent start to the Lisbon Estádio da Luz.
Ronaldo took an early start, dealing a free kick to the goal from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range capabilities, from the 25-meter mark, increasing the score to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not open an account in the first half hour, got their first opportunity thanks to the attacker Edin Djeko.
Former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then in the center of attention was Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Poshtiga in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing by hand after fouling Fabio Quentran - Misimovic implemented it.
After the break, the vice-champions of Europe in 2004 secured the score with four more goals.
Peter Jiracek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions go to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled on coach Michal Bilec’s team and Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech in the 9th minute thanks to an instant reflex prevented a potential goal by Tomasz Siwok.
The best chances for Montenegro were when the duet of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was on the field.
Damjanovic in the 40th minute struck from the edge of the penalty area and almost scored a goal for Czech.
After the break, the bar saved the already battered world-class goalkeeper of the Czech Republic after the forward of FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 3-0 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is almost no doubt that the coach of the national team Gus Hiddink will now free up space on the bench of the team, which reached the third place in 2002, the Croats for the fourth time in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir stadium.
The long shot of Seljuk Inan in the seventh minute hit the stand, and the striker Kazym Kazym failed to hit the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the pitch with Mario Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x87> of Wolfsburg, who lost to Ivan Peri<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87> of Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro entry since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team – which already looked confident in its place after winning 4-0 in the first stage – took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the team of guests equalized the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland from the very beginning took a good pace, but only in the 23rd minute Robbie Keane from Los Angeles made the first net goal shot
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the defense of goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward found himself in the right place and, having let the ball through the line, changed the score by 1: 0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The company, which is part of the Dax list, said on Thursday that it is going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more research and development opportunities and hire thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s chief executives, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The staff of 2,500 people should grow to 4,500.
The leader of the global industrial software market plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this booming country, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
Relying on China’s growth is an important component of the Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The business of a software provider with 55,000 employees around the world looks better than ever.
SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on informatization in China.”
Mass killings - the human dimension
Peter Englund’s intense and very good new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that makes your heart stop.
Here’s a tip on how to read on: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of characters will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you will stray off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he’s written now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as “working on anti-history.”
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, deft journalists, or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what was, he explains, as "a book about what it looked like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and state of mind."
The book “Beauty and Sorrow” weaves together the experience of 20 years of war more or less unremarkable men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people are going to be heroes.
Someone will get captured, lose an arm or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives twinkle here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of history books.
It is also an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When a canon is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with children, will you stay in place or will you run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost no one understands what is happening and in general why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” observes Mr. Englund, “is filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" traces the fate of such people as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other already published materials.
The stories of their lives can be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund’s collected small moments and fragmentary details.
Many of them are about hardships and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Ersatz, ersatz everywhere."
"Replacing coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about ersatz food in Germany.
He describes "meat of pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and decorated with fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skins; shoes beaten with wood."
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American observes in himself a craving for cruelty and says of war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, and not to sit in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this show is a civilization and under your starched shirt is cooked with a lid."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice or be upset.
“When a person comes to terms with the thought of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But it is the other way around, very much like a “convicted man who is hanged in secret.”
Other remarks concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new kinds of fear.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit who arranges a massacre while sitting at a desk."
People act in an unexpected way: lowly acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about the soldiers who tried in every way to catch venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhoea pus, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
“The very desperate rubbed it into his eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness.”
Translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is flexible, but sketchy, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory or novels such as Erich-Marie Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unconventional pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-fiction.
I'm not telling him.
But it’s as if he reached out from the book to the page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous mistake - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park should have had the fewest people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the others were first told they were going to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the action, his presence underlining how much the Police Department attached to the operation.
There could be no repetition of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which contradicted the department’s rules and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to liberate Zukotti Park from protesters.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on the island of Randels, counting on Zuccotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills – counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police – referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at “the last minute,” said a source familiar with the orders, which referred to the task only as “training.”
“The few cops I know who were called into the case were not told they were being sent to Zuccotti Park,” the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
“The only ones who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were in the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who rushed in ahead of the deadline after hearing about these plans.
Tuesday's operation involved members of various police units, including forces from the districts - a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal neighborhoods of the area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and go from the park during the day, which makes 1 a.m. a good time for an offensive.
“It was right to do it when there are the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Floodlights and pre-recorded announcements coming from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When officers of administrative units in their blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case the park needed arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police acted, and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said the cameras on Church Street, along the park's western border, could have captured the image.
As police marched west through a pile of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothing, the sanitation department teams followed her, collecting what was thrown.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged out, and photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied their hands together.
Two men were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue workers were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed after about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Brown said about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violating public order and resisting arrest,” he said.
The most senior officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the department's detective force, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not lead the operation,” Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they had to go inside.
The barriers were placed on Courtland Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
The SMM saw the police extend the perimeter from these positions even further beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, the SMM saw a group of police officers, many with shields, displacing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of service staff of schools will sue the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school attendants who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
The trial is probably the last resort available to the District Council Trade Union 37, which is trying to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city lost their jobs on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by groups of workers to close a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials have categorically denied the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget they signed in June.
One board member parried, telling him that there was no indication anywhere in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37th District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the claim to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and list eight temporarily dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint at the disposal of the New York Times, the union has focused on a number of school layoffs in poor areas of the city to support the unfair treatment claim, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few in the Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 auxiliary school workers lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at 36 free high school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget shortfalls.”
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way it counted extra funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The union also claims that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The notice used the word “exceeding”, although “exceeding” is more often spoken of when a teacher from the school payroll moves to the list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators have been fired,” the lawsuit states, “not just transferred.”
The mission is over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph E. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), which praises the Libyans for a successful uprising and American troops.
“The point of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of the support of their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties.”
The language may seem innocuous, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and never went to the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
That left the American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually knock the ground out of its feet.
Then the events overtook the indecision of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is now ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “admires the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary perseverance in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures get the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or split lawmakers like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader in the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by Representative Bob Goodlatt (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote by the Congress of that convocation.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlath Amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that were introduced in this convocation.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “control over federal spending.”
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors – mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they “put forward” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote for the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of members of Congress, and the member of the House of Representatives Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the limit in two terms for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states object.
As much as members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th they made 66.
That pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they have achieved no more success than they do now.
The last amendment that was passed – the 27th – was approved in 1992, but introduced to Congress it was actually in 1789.
“Breaked but not defeated,” Giffords says in his first television interview since the assassination attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show “The Sun Will Return Tomorrow” and said that she wanted to get better rather than return to Congress.
Appearing on ABC's 20/20 News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate suggestions and needed help walking.
The program showed her the difficult path of recovery from a bullet wound that shattered her skull and pierced her left side of the brain, going from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the bill on the maximum debt.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
Asked by Sawyer how she was feeling, Giffords, 41, said: “Very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special issue of 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
The special edition spoke about the recovery of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In the video, filmed by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teaching her how to perform simple actions.
Nod your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word is "what."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video, shown by ABC, shows that music played a central role in Giffords’ recovery: we see the congressman singing along with the doctors “Girls just want to have fun” Cindy Lauper and “Free Fall” Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she does not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he was reading a Giffords article in the newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected assailant Gerd Lee Lafner is being held in Missouri prison and is undergoing involuntary treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I’m defeated.”
“And I said, ‘Gabby, you’re not defeated,’” Kelly said.
You're just beaten up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
The military feels more pity than respect.
The event was a Wall Street holiday that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The audience in tuxedos applauded him standing up.
“The military was looked upon as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the concert, which also featured then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Soldiers are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, the military says.
The audience is increasingly behaving as if they feel pity for people in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is leaving for Afghanistan soon.
“But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as if we are miserable.”
It’s a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most talk of pity is quiet and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Canchne warned them that non-military people would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they have crushed the rebels and been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if “under the guise of a brutal evil veteran,” said Canchne, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kance recalls how he told his sons: “When you talk about your service, you should expect a negative effect.”
The embarrassment the military is experiencing is partly due to America’s indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely lauded by a country that knows little about the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in the way that was common in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the soldier’s suffering.
Troops are judged by the number of campaigns they have made, the number of comrades they have lost, or the scale of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, at a historic court hearing, it is to be decided whether to accept a lawsuit by 28 men and women against the army on charges of non-resistance to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up for the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, according to her, at night she was raped by her colleague.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a male co-worker carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come into her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But the Texas native brushed off her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former service members will be anxiously awaiting a court decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether to go to trial in the lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by attorney Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 over the following months — 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or threatened with sexual violence by co-workers and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or prosecute the alleged assault after due process.
Burke says she's targeting senior military officers because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence? Top leadership."
Burke says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she will open a lot of cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
A defense team from the Department of Defense led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy – mostly that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine named in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by the Ferres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the combat zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between the two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, a veteran legal service seminar is preparing a case against four major military academies on charges of encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, a nonprofit group of American veterans of the Vietnam War is preparing a lawsuit against the military centering on diagnoses of “personality changes” that are being made to victims of violence to remove them from service — a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women’s Service Actions Human Rights Group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Affairs Office in December, accusing it of discriminating against pension claims from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills, proposing a series of measures, were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
But as you know, attacks are often unreported, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases went to trial - half as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to a string of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing during which she was asked if she had had sex with her boyfriend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was giving birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in the psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't the trial of him. It was the trial of me.'"
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavorable wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her classmates in the lawsuit moves forward is a tricky question, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward."
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been a critic of the Ferres Doctrine my whole life.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the incentives and restraints it imposes.
He adds, “The odds are pretty much against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just an ordinary guy exposing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to a mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared at his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the network: he spent much time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy - you just need to go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting to them is not difficult at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism by the British research center DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographic with scientific precision — something marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing group fans across Europe and then pitched them an ad, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a survey that asked questions about their level of education, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Using Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — even without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are often young men who are dissatisfied with immigration.
“Those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to explore everything from health issues to social trends, which are expressed in ‘Likes’, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-relevant information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site’s title in the title by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who can not be approached on the street with a notebook.
“Earlier, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to join the party, and they’d never accept you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you address them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers, such as their dorm mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunken statuses too often.
“You can’t solve a problem without identifying it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise be detected.”
Facebook is also constantly retrieving various kinds of data about its users.
The site’s data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, mid-term voter turnout in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information only they have access to—cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher can observe their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public student pages on Facebook.
“As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selvin says.
That’s why, despite years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and much of social is still happening offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik will be publicly brought to justice for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to orchestrating the twin attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told 500 people in court.
“I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I accept the action, but I don’t accept the guilt.”
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept under lock and key.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
“I thought he looked cold and inhuman,” one of the survivors on Ut<0xC3><0xB8>ya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally I felt a little better after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is feeling right now.
“I wish it looked like a monster, but it’s not,” one victim’s relative said.
“It would be a lot easier if that were the case.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Show at the Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs's death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest discovery in a newly-discovered interview, which was recalled ahead of previews in major markets this week, is how much that creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technology.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business executives suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skilled labor."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the television series Nerds Triumph about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, it was about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working full-time at his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of mass Internet adoption.
While a small portion of Kringley’s interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview went missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which comes out at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to lay out his technology philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers – reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley’s questions, forcing him to move faster to questions or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, iPods and iPhones, the Lost Interview has something ominously prophetic, as Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision for the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' posthumous work evaluations, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a troubled dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in business, I kept asking, 'Why are you doing this?' And the answers you keep getting are, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to detail his efforts to streamline reporting at Apple.
A frustrated way of recording expenses, often beginning with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted with “clarification,” he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
Jokes about the Pope:
Jobs details the “blue box” he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here at describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He recounts how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We’ve covered the globe half a dozen times, and you’re screaming at the payphone, and it’s a minute later, it’s coming into the next payphone,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young and all we learned was that we could make something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could have mastered the little thing that could control the big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think without it Apple could ever have come along.
Jobs goes on to detail one famous prank that he and Wozniak practically handled by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope’s phone, struggling to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and the cold calling of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a little monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of circuit boards, one buyer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about both the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered developing a computer mouse:
“I remember furious arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up and went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Some of the companies that are losing energy:
Long before he spearheaded Apple’s resurgence, Jobs foresaw exactly how many industry leaders would err in their vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
“Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who end up coming to the leadership of the companies, and the people making the product are being pushed off the decision-making platform.
The product genius that led to this monopolistic position is being supplanted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be Microsoft of the 90s.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as an art form:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a great deal of skillful work...when you spin a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are trade-offs you need to make – some things you can’t force to do are electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head — these concepts — connecting them all together.
Ultimately, it comes down to taste – it comes down to trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it wasn’t for information technology, they’d be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court hears the case
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious question of whether he would listen to President Obama’s health care law rebuttal, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated at a dinner sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging a sweeping health care overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, a landmark debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle in the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time a court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual luncheon, a long-standing group that consistently champions conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represented one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
Attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a known opponent of the health care law.
Honorary guests at lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the Federalist Society’s events for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or be mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ apparent proximity to the two law firms in this case, as well as to the company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the assertions of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Case.
“The judges drank and dined at an official fundraising event with lawyers whose cases are now being heard in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with the groups involved in cases such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a prominent conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is in relation to Judge Elena Kagan that the ethical question arises, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the first instance court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in the defense of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing Receives Record $18 Billion Aircraft Order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 wide-body airliners and is likely to order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the transaction - more than $ 1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is an aircraft manufacturer of Boeing Co., and the price list for all these 50 aircraft is $ 18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft – 50 two-pass Boeing 777 aircraft.
The incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Airshow 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price of six aircraft will be more than $ 1 billion.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neil Diora said.
“The quality of these particular buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but also the rise in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, as it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so disastrous, because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from encroaching on its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded to increase the carrying capacity and flight range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister appears to have lost in Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that drug traffickers helped Fausto Vallejo, an opponent of the IRP, in the election race.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister did not appear to have fulfilled her bid for the governorship of Michoacán during the fierce state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers had helped incline the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the post of governor of the western state is Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our election workers.... They grabbed ballot boxes, put up obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing to return, and winning in Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly overtaken Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who led the ratings until election day.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate for the National Action Party, or PNP, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now owns the governor’s seat, came in third – a major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, has denied links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán was long dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
This is President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues to this day.
The MHP mayor was assassinated a week before the election when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates withdrew from the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how bad the Michoacán elections look, victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who is supposed to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, “I think this victory should be very encouraging on the eve of next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has ordered India and China to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will halt growth in the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of ADB’s Manila office, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to speed up the currency bloc’s recovery through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe’s difficulties “impartially” and said Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
“It concerns all of us.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
“So if China and India can help, it must be done.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing has skyrocketed, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s unfolding debt crisis has raised fears that it could lead the world economy back into recession, and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- like the purchase of bonds from the EU's financial assistance fund, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy is currently experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unsettled,” he said.
“We have ambitious targets and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a prerequisite, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point, they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going to sea for holidays, and it will not be well received,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, unprofitable enterprises such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “lowering risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to make “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of potential cuts in defense spending
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta escalated the situation in Congress on Monday, warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to the $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more could be inevitable if Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
“The implications of these cuts will be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester triggered a 23% overall reduction and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a drastic cut, applied so thoughtlessly, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unworkable -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and cause serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote.
“We will also have to force many of our civilian workers to be fired, and since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civilian workers in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our military and cause serious damage to combat readiness.”
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"Although military funding in the Overseas Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements will be seriously affected by a major disruption in core budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contract staff will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and a surveillance contract that supports the troops.”
“Staff will be cut, which will result in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We stand firm against these draconian actions,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday night as they released Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not an option we can live with, and it’s not an option we have to impose on ourselves.”
“Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter or senators’ latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or strengthen calls for the Pentagon to be freed from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work in the leadership of the Pentagon after many years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and aware that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defence minister painted a bleak picture of what might come next: a shelled but non-core force.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
“This is the wing of an aircraft without sufficiently trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor preparedness, and inability to fight potential enemies.”
“In essence, it encourages aggression.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined new details of how the cuts “raise significant operational risks: slow down response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face hurdles, including those that have already passed tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its proponents say it is a vital next step to improve on and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to catch a lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows just how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has been busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with perjury, as they allegedly hid that retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught with a microphone on when he told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner has made a fool of himself by denying his anecdotes, which was quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital affairs.
And again, no one living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating on exams at school and college are common.
There were cases when teachers gave students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Mentors, who are supposed to teach the opposite, send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Over the course of one day, studies show that you can lie 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that a significant part of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Identifying a lie or incriminating a lie is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike room games, like, say, charades, where you need to exclaim "I'm caught!", the detection of lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look me in the eye.
They do not always stagnate, stammer, blush or fuss.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of the statements, facial expressions, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in the vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it is clear that identifying lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps in navigating our complex world — especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheater, others will feel less guilty about cheating you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "defining the initial state".
This helps provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly knocking with his legs in a normal state, then you will not bring unfair accusations when you see a foot tap in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can fix the top of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean toward the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show “relief after the interview” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interview signal just to look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson stumbled and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
Spiking people may also use distance in saying, “I didn’t have sexual relations with this woman...Miss Lewinsky,” or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely perceptible.
Someone may use “qualifying language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... truth be told... as far as I know... as far as I know.”
This makes the answer more emotional than factual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic way to detect a lie, but you can master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to become a victim of skillful crooks in professional and personal life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Construction Plan Needs Review After U.S. Threat to Postpone Its Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering trade unions but reassuring environmentalists -- a company planning to build an oil pipeline said it would be willing to renegotiate the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said on Monday evening it would remove the planned pipeline from Nebraska’s environmentally sensitive Sand Hills area and was confident the project would still get approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
That comes after the State Department said last week it would postpone a federal-level decision on the project until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and Ogalala’s aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
A new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to delay a decision until 2013, after next year’s election, although authorities have denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision a State Department call and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It has to ship 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do this, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by unions, who hope for about 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up movement out of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A current State Department study on the environmental impact showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but an energy industry source said the Department's auditor commissioned a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial research was inappropriate, as it was affiliated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBell sued for allegedly causing her child to feel sick from fear
A family in New York City claims that disco diva Patti LaBell began to riot in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to the point that she was sick with fear.
Lady Marmalade’s tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered “personality change, sleep disorder” and “strong fear of strangers,” her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to embark on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell angrily reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door,'" Monk said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’
She became furious and began to use swearing -- the word for C and the word for F -- in high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring the water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBell lashed out at her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The baby was crying so hard, she added.
The family later sent LaBell a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBell’s representatives did not respond to calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the harm is not reported, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money he receives to charity to children with cancer.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBell accountable for her actions,” Davis said.
“This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez's rule, unemployment and the illegal labor market grew in Sinaloa, foreign funding declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 is the year that will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as related to the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only led to millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing a reduction in economic activity by a total of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic drop of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on frost-affected areas provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were wholly affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters was recorded an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent.
Decreased liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is due to many factors, for economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by the actions that were taken in public policy.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment that is linked to several factors, including a loss of liquidity in the market to limit resources imposed by a law that was passed in Congress to fight money laundering, as people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest in and use for something,” he said.
Stopped Immigration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said there was also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been limited, primarily because of the difficulties of entry, and in the second – because once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remains and requires jobs here in the state, as a result, the unemployment rate increases,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa’s labor market analysis gets worse if you look at the large number of violations that prevail in the working environment, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state’s active population works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregular clearance, another reminder of work in the state is represented by low wages; the state has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to a decline in economic activity and a high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the state's FDI amounted to $630.697, which shows a drop of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Department of Economic Development of the state government recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly accounted for companies from the service sector.
Debt
Amid the economic downturn, the state government asked in July during the state congress for approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez demonstrates the lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Deceleration of the economy
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Loredo said events such as early frosts had halted the state’s economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing it below our expectations,” he said.
Revising the direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needs to continue the most dynamic production activity.
“Overall, we found that we were working on it, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved in the work and that I can say that some work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is a lot more to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to 8 pounds of marijuana.
Five years in prison and an income penalty of 100 days - such a sentence was imposed on a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The attorney general's office said the convicted drug trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a health crime, in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol of Cipriano Valdez Street, before post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, in which he was carrying a black bag in a box in the car, and in the passenger seat - a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizures have been transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Crime Legal Consequences Support Centre.
You need to make contributions to the work
Public works related to programmes such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for Migrants run the risk of remaining unfinished or permanently delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, while work programmes have so far evolved, they are at risk, as the state government is unable to make the appropriate contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the staff should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so that it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they did not give us a penny, when from the beginning of July they had to give us a part," he said, "in order not to postpone, we started work and they are very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the reign the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
“It happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial capacity to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, to get access to those programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state has left,” he explained.
Although the state authorities had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interest relating to them came as quickly as possible.
“They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected constitutional claims made by the Senate and House of Representatives against a presidential decree that postpones the so-called “digital TV transition” from 2021 to 2015 because it failed to get the eight votes needed to annul it.
A minority of the four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing actions for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in law by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive power could not determine by general rules the measures for which the public administration should prepare.
“I also don’t believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the governance of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes that has occurred in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of the digital transformation, which involves meeting societal needs that have more than just a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic governance, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive branch, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacán analyzed the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
The difference between the first and second places in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “vote by vote” is real with regard to this year’s election process in Michoacan, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Programme (EERP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 protocols.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoacán Election Institute (MICI), Maria de Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to align local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the deadlines specified in the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim put forward by the local legislature, and called the state’s constitutional reform representative’s vote “invalid and illegal” because he had no right to “allow or support them.”
In an interview on the possibility of a “vote-for-vote” Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council, IVM would be able to submit a partial or full vote count to the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting and counting protocol in the ballot box or it is not with the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes in an election may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the proposed candidate winning the election in question and the one who received the second place in the voting is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of those candidates.
A total recount shall also be made if, at the end of the regular recount, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken second place, in the event that the ballot boxes that were counted in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRV, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes from the total number of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; an examination and a memorial service were held on Monday.
According to the family, the colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sapaliname Mountains.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the crash, the family of Basio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Mart<0xC3><0xAD>.
At noon, the colonel’s ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he underwent a Santillo Institute of Technology survey organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member while in high school.
“His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, he always told this to his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot’s sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left Saltillo very young to enter the College of Aviation in Sapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that his head was spinning even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
He is sent on his last journey.
Shots fired from guns were fired in honor of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of which he attended at the 1985 Technological High School in Salty, and the last of which he attended at the 1985 Technological High School in Salty.
Basio Cortés was killed recently when a helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Provincial Government Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of that ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés, a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral home by members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, to the esplanade of the training school where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, her brother and other apprentices.
Three bodies found abandoned at NL Cadaret farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderaita Jimenez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found on a 1.5 kilometer stretch of Caderaita highway in the direction of Santiago, on a hill in the commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that in the village house, the wall of which is painted beige and brown, the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Almost in one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no casings at the site.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group by another, also in it and in the gate there are several holes from bullets.
11 caught in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereit and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11, eight people were detained in the colony of Los Alvero, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., when military personnel were making a patrol detour in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereit, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kaderait.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy’s president tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy’s appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take up its positions.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well delineated," he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought the size of their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
At the heart of the pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets have set Italy’s BTP bond yields at more than 7 percent for 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting Monti: “We said we would actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti’s chances of success were largely based on the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s LDP party, which was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centrist-right party, told reporters.
Support for the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because, to date, many of its members have opposed the government majority, consisting of technocrats, that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
He will conclude his series of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italy’s debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Saving Italy with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 billion public debt would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial backers.
Monti said his government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before calling new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist it should be made up only of technical specialists, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is influenced by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more gaming experience than Tikos
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, ten have already played in 50 international matches.
From the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica when you compare the 22 players summoned by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA ranking, have a whole list of A-class qualifiers, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have held 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named after Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish players who play in the All-Star League and in strong Premier League clubs have been very active in the league and local cup competitions throughout this year, and they are high-level players in European Cups and Champions Leagues.
To this should be added the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that tops the list in the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernández, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were voted the best last week by UEFA along with another Iberian player, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and goal scorer Schalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
It almost approaches the hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Costa Rican side next to Michael Uman, left side Junior Diaz with 48 matches and scorer Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the line in 30 games: Keylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeif with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain with Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiola (31).
In the national team with less than 30 field appearances there is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The others didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Morel has only four games and Hordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one, Allman Vargas and Nelson Adder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, it was Brian Ruiz who brought in more points, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of the best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It’s been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the statement of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America as part of a 20-year tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, together with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is available online at The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some devotion to the band; the fans live in suspense in the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we are sorry that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, in anticipation of your concert, refer to it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We had some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this show in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, these are great places to surf, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you have done a grand show with a lot of songs.
What do you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, we don’t have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we’ve been doing that for over 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are very excited about our success and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Everything is going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the flowering of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be a part of this great group.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and for us to be part of the Seattle sound that turned out.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same band for so long.
Yes, the four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and things couldn’t be better.
Your attitude to the word fame was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We care about not being on tour for too long because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what made it, without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of disappointments because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we are still close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think of the incredible person that Andy was, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video offers and it was the band we liked the most so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas has to offer live and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping grunge relevant even though it’s no longer in vogue?
I think we all feel a certain detachment from the word grunge.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came out at the same time, and if it’s important now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was darker, but now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you grow up and there’s been some trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for a medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be examined for the loss of muscle strength that is seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which he underwent four times and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told N television that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said he believed Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations for tongue cancer, lost weight 18 kilograms, which was added to other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Special Operations Police Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by an army extermination squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin talks on the region’s political problems.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the most important item in an extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by Uruguay's leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “favorable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations”, as the leadership of the South American country published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support for Uruguay in the incident with France, which happened when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked Uruguay's protest and the withdrawal of his ambassador to a European country for consultations.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group set up from the most developed and developing countries, and has essentially had a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to hasten the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave this Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “grey list” of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
Mustache plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser’s evil paws, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in “Super Mario 3D Land,” he will fight for the girl’s love in stereoscopic technology.
The release, which will be available in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to tell us how stereoscopy will work without glasses,” Nintendo’s head of press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, said during a game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that despite its existence in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and moving game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go “second round” to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or the one that affects only the depth of action, but on which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero’s return to the portable console, something that hasn’t happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats a successful formula from previous games, the plumber with a mustache needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, scenery, costumes and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colum guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun in order for him to answer in the United States for a $70 million laundering plot.
Thus ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a news conference, Colom said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate, he did not “handle” legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for selling drugs.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CJ), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defense during the presidential term, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary served as an occasion for the results of the ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijovo.
After the Chairman of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education consultant, Ernest Maragall, and ex-lieutenant of the mayor and current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal council, Rickard Goma.
Also appearing in Fabra I Coats is the current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Clarice and social work CEO La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijovo was born at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and instilling hope in people experiencing difficulties.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, where they had illegally occupied it and where they had organized mass parties that irritated neighbors, without the intervention of the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
“From now on, there will be a checkpoint here,” the manager said.
The squatters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest are settled, appropriated all electricity and some water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by visitors to the club, but by residents of the squat and, above all, those who attended parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he "forgives" her rent.
City police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, councillor Alberto Fernand D<0xC3><0xAD>az, demanded last week "immediately evacuate the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen among neighbors and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the past few months, squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room, and that some of them have been broken into.
In this sense, he added, “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the lack of culture that is being created in the building.”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in No Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police left for Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after disputes about contributions
The 16-door municipal competition has reopened the debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SKB, in 1987 the park again took a place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was so until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colcerol.
Under the gate is understood the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is one: Kolserola? Park or mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion for all architects of Barcelona.
This is perhaps the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
The biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
This is due to its excellent accessibility.
The colserola is more complicated,” says the architect, for whom the title “Colserola Gate” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we have to act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers.”
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the site of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
"Limiting something is preparing the next step," that is, the transition.
“We have to think about new urban planning tools because the current [General Capital Plan (GSP)] could lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colcerola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical question.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside Calcerola, which “should not be missed”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor’s office offers his profession to join this project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is what should guide the multidisciplinary teams (“success,” he argues) that were to create: “Architects should only be a tool.”
Bayona hints that the answer to the question posed by the name of this part is complex, since the rules of the contest lack a general view of the colserola: "16 overlapping contests have been announced," he says, "in the sense of a sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes, at least in his case, decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for a single gate can intersect by program and definition with an architect’s project for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council should ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the court representative of the Red Casino forgave the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting a extortion trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia posted a series of photos and videos claiming that Manuel Jonas demanded that he pay an economic contribution to the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following a second order banning movement after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Kaderait allegedly for extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in a prison with an average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his service in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest order was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, the evidence of Jonas’ guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of bookmakers in exchange for the authorization of the operation, was quite obvious.
On Monday, Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for a pardon for the region’s mayor’s brother so that he could be freed in the coming hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the gambling house’s partners was granting a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to mention the name.
Based on entry 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and after that no statement can be made regarding the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation and punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
A court clerk, Jorge Yanez, went to the San Nicolas Municipal Jail in Garza to notify Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacomé recounts the details of the disaster that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) said the results of the accident, which killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft climbed up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
“The elements that seem to show that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the tool lost its overhang.”
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the transportation of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of the impact do not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transportation of passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
By this point, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Support Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was operated at cruising speed and that it happened on soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hacomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for takeoff when the aircraft headed to the border area between the city of Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Cuernavaca Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record from the aircraft’s radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of flight direction.
Scattered debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the strike occurred on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground in terms of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the area of the disaster remains unfound evidence in the wreckage of the ship, a kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the ground.
While working on the site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful investigation of a larger area than the delineated area near the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts were found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection Leads Study to Find Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; Supported by IPN Experts
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young adults, which is called the protocol “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence”, which will provide a count of signs associated with overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Department of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the XXI Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was assembled.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to take part, going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the valley of Mexico City, where every Saturday, from 8:00 in the morning will be tested with the participation of children.
He stressed that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Cuautemoca (in the west of the state of Mexico), and from October 8, the events are held at the sports center in Nezahualcoyotl (east of the state of Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (south of Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, and the main goal is to collect three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with the permission of their parents and under their supervision to fill out individual nutritional questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), measurements of blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be carried out.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said the study reflects health care professionals’ concern about the alarming weight gain among children.
In medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006, it is said that in just 6 years there was an increase: in the case of boys 77 percent were obese, in the case of girls 47 percent; in the case of overweight, there was also a significant increase, "- said the specialist MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 percent descended from American Indians, 30 percent descended from Europeans and five percent descended from Africans, and this condition affected genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the participants’ immediate benefit is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can reveal whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acanthas) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
With information treated with complete confidentiality, doctors pass it on in writing to parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV and using transport over short distances instead of walking.
It also happens because of the high calorie intake, that is, the increase in the consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamaley, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature influences.
If the signals sent by the road surface were given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, and adds that if the process of building and maintaining the asphalted road surface is correct, then the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced.
In his lecture Technological Perspective on Pits, delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular weight called asphaltenes, and others low molecular weight called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscous behavior of bitumen lies in the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes brittle, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
He noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating that consists of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is bitumen, composed of small stones lowered into the bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When driving vehicles and exerting effort, it helps the forces to be very well distributed over the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, placed the last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, in fact the sand is also submerged in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these forces, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of asphalt.
When the earth is raw, water penetrates the coating and it is difficult to get out of it, this causes softening of all layers of the coating and, therefore, the formation of pits.
In the formation of pits, he said, the wear layer is the first to wear out and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not happen instantly, this is a process that should be paid attention to at the first signs of routine repair programs.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent the frequent appearance of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that regarding bitumen, much still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to fix pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing for the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valletta received the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to want to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to be on the podium with a silver crown and ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
Based on the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won a crown and a scepter, the department counts 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Belaring Dores (1949), and Alessa (1989).
A question that many people are asking now:
What was not enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, for a reason she was elected the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person according to Vogue - titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?” asked by Martin Murillo Gomez of the Let’s Read.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood — The Little Prince — is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at the moment I am reading a book by Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “culturation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with her result: “the universe is wise, what is happening is what is supposed to happen.”
And all of you, please read a little bit, The Little Prince is a great book.
Among the hypotheses voiced, Valier was burned by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was preferred, met with a standing ovation, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Culinary competition of Ostera, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, provoked stress from the Queen, and as a consequence she did not shine on the stage."
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the Like Home program on RCN, said the fact that Milena was named a princess “means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest doesn’t become queen.”
In addition, the representative of Valletta has recently avoided communication with the press and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vallet failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doty said they were looking for a woman committed to their country’s social needs.
“The beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in the projects,” she said.
There is also an assumption that the representative of Valletta sinned with defects on the buttocks and fibrosis, which was visible on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Consultant to Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but the problems of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me were not very noticeable, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
“Operations are good, but the representative of Valier does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction came true last night, they say that it was a woodpecker that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for the fact that she lost the pleasure of receiving the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact is that today Melina is starting a year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions, indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminalist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is crucial.
On November 4, CTI criminologist Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminologists working this week, it is the turn of Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tejad who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
Early in his career, Gonzalez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to wade through the jungle for more than five days to reach the location of the bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in criminology, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and trunks.
During the week of Elizar’s operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Kauka to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Guillermo Leon Saenz’s (his real name) fingerprints.
However, when he arrived with the research team at the location where the body was located, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and considerably thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a spatula, and a flashlight, Elizar matched the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the images.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n that it was the head of the FARC.
Searching for Fingerprints
For the fingerprint specialist of the Sijin division of Cali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos by Elizare Gonzalez at a press conference about the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without errors, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting specialists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
When detained, many criminals have fake IDs or do not have documents.
We're taking their fingerprints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in case of theft, he had to carry away a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief leaned his hands to take possession of a safe full of jewels and money.
“Walls are hard to work with because they are not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a snapshot of the entire palm and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with liquor bottles around him.
During the investigation, it was established that a relative could have been suspected of committing a crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
While this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does prove that he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist from CTI explained that where there are fingerprints, a chemical or physical reagent is applied.
When they appear, a spatula or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the registry.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just as not all the gold that glitters, not all that you touch leaves fingerprints.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry People Challenge New York City's Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped outside Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court’s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to break into Manhattan Square again, under a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn while trying to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go, thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the crackdown by seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to set up camp in the square, we will set up camp somewhere else and continue the legal fight to get back to Zuccotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the representatives of the “Occupy Wall Street” movement.
Bray explained that the “angry people” response to the evacuation of the tent city, which was ordered personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling prohibiting forced evacuations from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the “angry people” began to seize a new park located at the confluence of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the parish of the Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they could have occupied the place, but then the police arrived and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization claims that several hundred people stood with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support for members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning’s crackdown on protesters.
Some of the protesters heading there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave these copies to the police officers guarding the square, which led to “some small clashes,” Bray said, who said some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and forcing them to comply with “laws that were issued after the beginning of the seizure, or prohibit demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court ruling, the city suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to deploy tent stores and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters “violated the law.”
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clear the square as it became “a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people” as “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors feared “a deterioration in the quality of life.”
The evacuation this morning was abhorrent and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a spokesman for the movement, which condemns the mayor for “disrespecting free speech.”
Those responsible for the “Occupy Wall Street” also indicated that they intend to organize “grandiose actions” on Thursday in cooperation with public organizations and trade unions to remember the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the Russell Peters Christmas television program on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant in The Great Repair, a lifeguard in Rescuers Malibu, Bunny in Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the crowner (ballad performer) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians will appear in the TV program “Russell Peters Christmas” on December 1, in the role of a very special Maria.
CTV presented footage today of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely circulated online homemade pornographic video where she appears alongside her then-husband, "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e" drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently appeared as host on Charlie Sheen’s My Cruel Torpedo of Truth tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show CTV features Canadian singer Buble, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot about scandals.
Recently, Bublé called “bitch” American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York
Japan, reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that triggered the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster suffered by the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
According to initial estimates by the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million – a blow that, despite the dire world situation, seems to be passing.
After three losing quarters in a row, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% decline in capital expenditures, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true turnaround in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructure, using loopholes to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% under the influence of increased costs for cars, travel and recreation.
The yen stamp
Tokyo granted the domestic market, when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugee currencies” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro zone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that weighs like a stone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow for a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As long as markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be attentive to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, said the Minister of economic policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts fractures in the global economy, showed that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the average, which is at 100 points, after it collapsed by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives grounds for doubt
Papademos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander the maze that leads to a way out of Europe’s big debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new transitional government of Greece is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon when he was appointed may not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, says he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections on February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papademos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate, which will be crowned tomorrow by a vote of confidence in the new executive.
The package of 24 programs to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything.”
The conservative leader took one step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that are supposed to unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by Papandreou’s all-or-nothing referendum claims, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible.”
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafai said troika inspectors could return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche” of $8,000 million, although an exact date has not yet been set.
In the Greek tangle there will be enough thread for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The queen stressed the "main" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose “essence”, she said, is that it is “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such action is “absolutely necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with the aim of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day – the level at which it is “destroyed”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and is taking on this task with all the “responsibility”, says Dona Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that have arisen during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, the main recipients of these loans”.
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to the “two main goals”.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of these households would be lifted out of the poverty into which they were plunged.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “went along the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as an “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the instrument’s father as a “striking idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty,” whose work has been known for 15 years, ever since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study on-site his lending policies.
That experience took over the first World Summit in Washington a year later and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “everywhere I have seen continuous development,” said Her Majesty, whose association with the project earned her the title of “head of the family” gathered in Valladolid yesterday as a “poor man’s banker.”
Finally, Queen Sophia concluded her speech by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said that solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it is a “permanent commitment”.
Jimenez concluded that microcredit implies “a serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty” and that now “more than ever” developed-country governments must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez praised the “success” in giving “confidence” to people “destitute, before whom all doors are closed”, and Valladolid Mayor Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, which “opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but arose in the fall itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and, perhaps, tomorrow with regard to Italy.
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, which deserved their speeches Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, europhile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to give Europe a face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; Britain opposes it, and CDU leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy opposes it, too.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the board of the European Central Bank against the size of each country’s economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in dire straits that like to criticize “arrogant” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes a whole paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Only in passing.
Two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Hospital Letter Fraud?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an offensive on the hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit distribution fund and deliver a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose out of a desire to save in a difficult situation, but also forms part of the campaign of the right for re-election as president, the majority wants to concentrate on the sick leaves.
First of all, with a view to saving the budget, the government intends to impose on employees of private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the specific consent of the employer, the sick employee will lose a salary in four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to spark a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to savings of 280 million euros.
And that will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on civil servants without payment of sickness benefit (civil servants have not yet had to wait for payment of the benefit, as opposed to a three-day wait for private sector workers).
Now, when these issues are discussed, the majority also raises the topic of fraud again, referring to abuse in the issuance of hospital sheets.
Control will be tighter and in addition, if you get caught, you will have to return all illegally received payments," Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital sheets.
Indeed, they have been under constant scrutiny and political attack since 2002 and are bearing fruit.
People in France are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
First, let’s look at the country’s numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily compensatory costs in 2008 of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 million accounted for 5% of total health spending.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and industrial accidents and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand million euros.
And, therefore, accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenses.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic average, which hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time on health insurance, found that in 2010, 37% of hospital patients lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If we compare these figures with those of our European neighbours, we can see that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall share of absenteeism in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital leaves is very low compared to “gray” employment.
As for the fraud rate, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 has led to a systematic review of hospital stays of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases reviewed, the CNAM found that 13 percent of the 285,000 short-term disease findings were “unjustified” or too long, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically screened hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unfounded”, which is equal to 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unfounded” for the several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with the figures of "gray" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, they amount to between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros of under-received budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to accomplish this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the “main task” of the new government, since the country’s presence in the Eurozone is “put on the map”, he added.
Accordingly, Papademos forecasts a reduction in the country’s budget deficit “to approximately 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right-wing rejects the new government’s measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, a right-wing leader, voiced his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said at a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renu, the European commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million loan without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, says Royal Society of Canada report
As far as palliative medicine is concerned, the committee argues that the government, health care institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, and this is not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are not allowed to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicalization or not, but 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in a hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse in application, that is, euthanasia or assisted suicide against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, Jocelyn Downey explains.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia, because, according to a 2010 poll by Angus Reid, they believe that this will allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
For people who have assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest, among their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that the lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
As for palliative care, the committee calls on the government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it is not used to dull physical pain, as euthanasia is, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the Royal Society of Canada report.
Metre Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health legislation, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, because among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says meter Deschamps, who yesterday discussed the summary of the report.
M. Deschamps also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said, “There are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health care law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a “manifesto for euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, among other things, the report’s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Relinquish Power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration in front of the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, backed by Russia, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country, intensified yesterday.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan have called for the resignation of President Assad.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar had his country’s interests at stake, he would have had to resign, but he would also have had to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” the king of Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, told the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, expressed regret that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were not successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country toward which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough line against repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Derya area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other residents were killed during gunfire and heavy machine-gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
In addition, he sharply reacted to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, according to him, is a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail.
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the Arab League is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the entry into the country of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also called for the deployment of UN monitors to help protect civilians from reprisals by a regime he said had fallen into “paranoia.”
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis recovery plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities where fighting is taking place and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect” yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and victims from the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a program that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner participated in a discussion with political parties ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of non-parliamentary technocrats.
Monti spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the prime minister-designate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti's parliament would ask for a vote of confidence before Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the President, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare a government and a program,” he said, adding that he was convinced markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns have resurfaced, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians.”
The new government would have to operate until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mr Monti guaranteed that, once he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important actor in Europe.
Olli Rehn, a spokesman for the European Commission, said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not comply with the 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, demanded, in particular, new strict measures.
Italy’s “boss of bosses” Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters.”
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a “change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconiism”, a “professor” symbolising the “challenge of seriousness” and “another Italy”, according to the authors of the editorials.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as Italy is due to make public debt payments worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 million by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “starting in the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by methods of explosion.”
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to set up a company producing nanodiamonds in Kiev.
His company’s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “clear signs that Iran’s development of a ‘nuclear detonator system’ was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also told the agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology as part of his home country’s military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared with a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in attacks against Jews, and an overall increase of 14% in the number of religious-related crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is of concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, Human Rights First emphasizes, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization added in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the group’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes,” he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes.”
"Hate crimes" in federal law are a legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, nationality, and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming more like Facebook
On Monday, Twitter’s microblogging site made changes to its platform’s presentation that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes the service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and another “name” allow you to follow more easily and directly the activities of other “twitters”, internet users whose messages (“twitters”) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible to know if they will post messages, if they will subscribe to new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before going public across the network on Monday, Caroline Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known for being intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather obscure terms (RT for reposting someone else’s gossip, #followfriday for recommending to track other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, thus opening itself up to a wider audience, introducing users to something closer to the popular social networks of Facebook.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, intrusive, and too Facebook-like.”
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed, <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
AUSTRIA
Introduction of the “golden rule” of the budget into the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget “golden rule” into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by rating agencies of the state credit rating of Austria (triple A).
Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of a meeting of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s solvency were to fall by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest on three thousand million euros more each year, argued Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister from Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria is meeting the demand of the Eurozone summit on October 26 in Brussels; heads of state and government demanded a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decree adopted by the Austrian government resembles the “German model”, as Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of a federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the lands, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to force public debt to fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshihiko Noda
Threat of new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities will conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to the historical mark, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record for strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a “refuge” in these troubled times of global economic decline and Europe’s debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark, close to the level that triggered the latest intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the volume of income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into the national currency.
“Japan is fighting to rebuild itself” after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr Noda, who fears that this rise in the yen will kill the fragile germ of recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter of 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels the yen’s high price does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic performance.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Managing Director Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps”, making it clear that no further easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand million euros) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55 thousand thousand million yen (519 thousand million euros) the ceiling of the amounts that it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
Euro zone
Interest rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of infection by the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges went this Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended trading at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
With new difficulties in disbursing loans to struggling eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent gains.
“Worried investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under the weight of new doubts from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its sights on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the party congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, the opportunity for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield on Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the exchanges for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is under the threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the “main task” of his government.
Spain was under fire from markets ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections.
The spread between interest rates on 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised down the second quarter figure, with a fall of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first euro zone-wide assessment is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are becoming an occasion to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed have been explored.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will entail doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will become necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalances – a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit, resuming construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
Although Germany’s renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal plants.
After a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion in turbine construction, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; which makes carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect ones.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole galaxy of specialized international trade small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 thousand million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years if its manufacturer were to be shut down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry had experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, reactor design and unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, represents a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is being considered by all energy professionals looking to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to rivals Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sides – the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinated to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “human rights state”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation, May 23) said that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters.”
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The left and right seem to agree on a lot of things.
On the right was Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers,” and on the left was Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world.”
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the territory of the hordes of Polish plumber felt both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they allow to be shown to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limited himself to platitudes, saying that “working together will solve our immigration problem.”
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an electoral advantage, but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Determined Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages, and employment in countries.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and reduces employment.
Fears of the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, provoking wage cuts.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants complement much more than they replace the local workforce by doing jobs for which there is a shortage of local labor.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the local workforce, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive Impact on Wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity existing between local and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migration leads to an increase of 0.6-0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the American Nobel Prize winners, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net income to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labor Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant, having arrived at the age of 30, will bring to the state budget for his life a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his mandate was going to "teeth" to cling to the missing points of growth.
These teeth, which were used to scare off immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to comprehend European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon "Little" it is known that this comes from the superficiality of thinking.
A universal vote, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it and may even become an “instrument of repression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have a double expository effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality must be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will gain nothing by demanding a series of national referendums, organised as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Carte blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a leap with legs tied into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of a common, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is unknown how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is completely subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the management of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of everyone’s debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in them.
The way out of the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delors all now demand a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into force in the city, is another madness and a new dead end.
We need to start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is united on an economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true people’s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming more widespread.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or shopping by simply holding a card over the reader.
460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide this year, up from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France is starting from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But big stores are picking up the pace.
This year, Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards.
To move to a higher speed, it is necessary for banks to provide equipment to their customers.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gerard Nebui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (near-field communication) technology necessary to perform such transactions.
“They were postponed.
“But they should really be going away next year.”
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Marc Berten, head of Eurosmart.
The banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with covers that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch a proposal to allow its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb’s ties to the Boko Haram sect.
Long-sought links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said Algerians were now confident.
“The way these two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without elaborating.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger in January found two links.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Lecours and Vincent Deloris were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the wreckage left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
Analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person allegedly close to Aqmi and to the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active," Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher, said in a statement.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident from Boko Haram’s actions and statements and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to pay attention to the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people, of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri at a mosque, school and under the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which in Hausa means “Western education is a sin” – preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict adherence to sharia, and its activists have launched a struggle against the wicked central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja’s reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect will radicalize and go beyond its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram staged the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi entrenched in Mali and Niger and al-Shabaab Somalis operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
The World as Seen by Republican Presidential Candidates
With regard to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world through simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters would believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud but undetailed statements on foreign policy, which have traditionally been a strength of the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the “Good Old Party,” threatened to file a complaint with the WTO against the Chinese and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Even worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a grasp of complex foreign policy, has been unable to overcome a position that indulges emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is held at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also pledged to step up military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to keep promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of the cases.
He recently called for countering China’s military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power – apparently without knowing that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and is seeking military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture on terrorism suspects, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to tone down the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of the “guys” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which have earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive is not so simple.
The population considers the balance of national security under Obama, which eliminated Ben-Laden, to be positive.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that get bogged down in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas to enter Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra’s performance and exquisite snacks, at the opening of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mart Rutte, together turned the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline of 27.5 thousand million additional cubic meters of gas will be supplied to Western Europe every year through the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France’s consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
In the most intense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at comparing the Nord Stream with the new “German-Soviet Pact”, hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already at an end.
“This pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” Francois Fillon argued, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lyubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left over from the Second World War.
“One hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream, said.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, without ruptures along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it, because Sweden was not happy that the Russian state-owned company would settle on its shores forever.
“In the event of an accident, we will cut off the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
So, in the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to designers who have designed seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is introduced into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by a stream of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
Circulation of gas is carried out only due to its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out the project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 percent each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Then Gazprom leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay back their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Lyubmin to the sandy shore, planted with coniferous trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Brand Notebook Moleskine
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has the scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by a rectangular black cover, by a rubber band, by yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, moleskin - lacquered cotton fabric, used, for example, to cover benches.
It is claimed that this type of notebooks are highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought an old and forgotten thing into line with today’s taste that was iconic for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s managing director at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales grew by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We are far from the production of the first years, when only 3000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Establishing the profile of a typical buyer is difficult, because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small towns and was able to gain wide fame.
“We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing despite the advent of email,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized an exhibition called “The Round Path”, where architects and artists showcased their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard print on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include handbags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
A success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is still twice as high as the average, namely 19% against 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes disability employment week.
“There has been a lot of progress in 15 years.”
“At that time, the share of the unemployed was not 2, but 3 times more.”
“But there is still a lot of work to be done.”
It must be said that for a disabled person there are still many obstacles to employment.
Among them, there are more elderly: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are at the heart of the problem,” according to Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association on behalf of Cité found that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "imagine solid people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% disabled workers set in a law passed in 1987.
The last known figures relating to 2008 give a value of 2.6%.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with the law.
Evidence: the number of “taxable” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>606 million to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>480 million).
“The 2005 law, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects a rise in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers against 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before battling the Blues on Tuesday night at 8:45 p.m., Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they got from this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the podium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker’s exit in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I’m very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he’s Belgian.”
"I want to go further," says the player of Lille.
As for the contrast between his achievements at the club and in the national team, this is one whole.
“I am in Lille all year round, but not in Belgium.”
“I have to earn points.”
Left in reserve, on the eve of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "glitter".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure".
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially the fact that on the other side are Mathieu (Debyushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“Our roads have just crossed.”
"Being able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens was good-natured in his recollection of "pride."
"Pride" to play in a "holiday match".
"Pride" also claimed as a "neighbor" that France "again became a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Nice.
“Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in the same plane with the leadership of the blue... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You will see this in future matches. Including this one against France."
Portugal is very self-confident.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento starts his return match against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, which he has been at the helm of since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played, and there is Bosnia to be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in hell Zenica is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal that would have reassured it.
“It’s a good result, but it does involve some risk.”
But at home, in their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be held, in front of an audience that should be delighted, although the match will be very tense,” said optimistic but reasonable Bento.
“We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
A draw on Friday in a match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could blame the Bosnians.
“It’s a good result, but there is some risk,” Bentou said.
“We will play against a team that has a lot of technical virtues and players who have a lot of individual virtues,” he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "do not give them time to think."
It’s a good idea if it’s realistic this time.
