The Welsh extra MPs are concerned about what they look like as marionettes.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should be changed to the status of “Member of the Parliament of Wales”.
MPs were outraged over plans to change the name of the local assembly to the name "Parliament of Wales".
All political parties believe this to be a hoax.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it rhymes with the words “stupid” and “nedarek”.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "foolish", and pwp means "not bad".
She said her group was not satisfied and offered alternatives.
Welsh conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a “puppet”.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to amend the name, made a statement: “The final decision on any description of what the members of the Assembly call will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for calling the meeting the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Additional Member, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or the CNC, but the CHUP option received the most support during public consultations.
Additional MPs obviously offer alternative options, but the path to reaching a consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a change bill in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on what they should be called when they do their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a long-standing issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
In Athens, long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim on their territory, which prevented the inclusion and membership of Macedonia in the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price to pay for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Names of St. Martin's temple are silent, the Bochum churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
“Earlier, as the old people I talked to used to say, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“There’s no one here today.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People have different communication and activities at the present time,” he said.
"Bars are no longer cozy local living rooms, where people go constantly."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for such a long period as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help the temples that will remain in the area.
“The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so it will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will become parishioners of these churches.”
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became a black neighborhood—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin’s Church—a decade later.
The original White Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, which prayed nearby, received the right of ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black community under the leadership of the likes of John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at the main store in Harlem's 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put into operation the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the cornelion "the bells of the poor people."
The expert, who played the curling iron in July, called it differently: “Cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical tool.”
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first coriander, played by black musician Dianicio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger coriander in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriwether said he had not been replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by the false leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The congregation – the governing body of the parish, consisting of the chaplain’s assistants – wrote to the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese would “try to transfer expenses” to the congregation, although the congregation did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark killed a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just excitement from catching lobsters, but then he “realized that something bad had happened: ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
“His entire collarbone was torn,” Hamel said, adding that he noticed this when he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: “In the water next to the shark!” – added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided it was a safe species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market with a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while sales of fashionable clothes and home goods are declining, larger houses of beauty will be featured in 11 showrooms across the country and also in other new showrooms next year.
The investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a space on shelves that were previously occupied by TVs, microwaves, and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, to appear for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded departments similar to those found in stores like Boots.
Large stores are also restarting their Boutique cosmetics line, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming more and more popular among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydan in southern London, and the second will open in Selye Owk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of groceries daily in local shops near the house leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the retail outlets will be more and more like department stores as the supermarket network tries to compete with Aldi's, Lidl's discounters by using more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also housed several Habitats outlets since it acquired both networks two years ago, which it says has boosted food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and pharmacy departments did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share the proceeds from pharmacy stores ended after a series of skirmishes in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 store Celestio to the owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It has been stated that Lloyds has played its part in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in training our employees who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive surroundings and convenient location make us the best home of beauty that stands up to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his brand, which specializes in the image of life to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of home goods and Truly accessories.
The couple's business has become similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old leader announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with his lucrative clothing business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was enraged when the "golden" TV girl confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million pounds means that she will no longer be engaged in goods and goods.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was doubled to double Willoughby's fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's number one friend.
This is a long-term vision that we will see in a few decades.
Her decision to resign left all the participants completely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening in the car, very soon it was supposed to start dinner.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading This Morning, which is among the most significant British stars, can cost companies millions because of huge investments in various goods - from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as possible further delays with their implementation.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The trio's mother, Willoughby, and husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the post of chairman in March.
The couple is vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby will become a representative of the M&S brand and replace Aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV "I am a celebrity".
Last night, a source close to Jones said: “We will not comment on his case.”
A hearty conversation, “after what we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for his comment, which is considered “non-presidential” for the fact that it speaks positively about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have so much to say?
Trump said his paradisiacal "dictatorial" voice.
“I’m not going out of my way.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was announced by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Lee Yong Ho, told the world’s leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not waiting for “appropriate measures” by the United States in response to North Korea’s previous disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We are very successful in building relations with North Korea,” he said.
“Everything could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of the US military home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be on the president’s side, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we’ll already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake on v. Lampok foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they are unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been resettled, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for the provision of international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopa, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that have always plagued Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
Although there were shelters built in Ocheche, in other coastal villages they are almost nonexistent.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of a tsunami in Palu has led to more casualties, although the warning has been.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a daunting task.
And natural disasters have complicated the logistics of the movement.
The hospital ship, which was located on the village of Lampok for the treatment of earthquake victims, is approaching Palu, but the way to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widoda focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure and spent money on highways and railways.
But the lack of funding is persecuting the Jock administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from long-standing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embrace a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool pushes the ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, equalizing the number in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Starridge received a transmission from Jardan Shakira when they were about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal sash, which ran 1–0.
He made a feint with the ball to his left before making a shot at a distant bar.
The attempt ended with a goal high below the top bar when the ball flew to the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kep Arisabalogi, who jumped, directly into the net.
“He was just trying to get into that position to kick the ball, and players like Shaq were always trying to kick as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible,” he said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante running, made an easy pass, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the beginning of the second half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard was killed in the 25th minute.
Attacking "blue" in this match made the pass Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, before returning to the midfield and run in half the field "Liverpool".
The team quickly found themselves in the middle of the field.
Then he made a spectacular shot, passing the ball to Azar at the gate.
Hazard ran away from the defender and punched into the lower left corner at the far bar past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool are battling Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
"Chelsea" meets "Videoton" in the UEFA Europa League at 3 pm on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Mitigation Agency said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, the representative of the agency Soutopa Purwo Nugroha said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 points, which occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was littered with rubble from destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson-Muse area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to reach out to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious and ask them to contact us.
I also urge everyone, particularly taxi drivers, whose video recorders may have filmed some video, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
A woman's friends came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Muse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will be a few hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the entire area is now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, investigating the apartment building.
Anyone with information should contact the <0x40>MerPolCC Police Department, call 101, or contact the Criminal Police Anonymously at 0800 555 111, naming the record 247 of September 30.
The parliamentary statue of Cromwell was the last centurythe memorable blow in the case of "rewriting history".
His removal would have been poetic justice for his similar Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate about the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornicroft's vivid representation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of an actor's historiography that many believe must still be revered.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been known by many since the late 19th century better than today as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is this a completely accurate representation, the subject of a long historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of this clash.
His achievements as a Lord-protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored.”
The killer pig was mutilated to death by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
“A man known only by his last name, Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and blood spilled, next to a shed at Lupanshui Market in Guizhou Province,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to introduce the swine vaccine in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Sinin in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He and his cousin are reported to have come from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the next pigsty was open.
He said that there was a large lump of blood in the piggy bank.
According to the report, a forensic medical examination confirmed that a 550-kilogram boar mutilated the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were covered with blood and damaged,” said Wu’s cousin (Guiyang Evening News).
Video footage from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent an attack on anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases when pigs attack people are rare, but they have been before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to suffer serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pushed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife let the animal go.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just assholes.
They're tough and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane "Rose" will bring heavy torrential rains to the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, hurricane "Rose" is weaker, as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the "Rose" will bring floods in northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
The rate of "Rose", a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose", as expected, will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form an area of low pressure, moving to the east, to the west coast of the United States. If Monday "Rose" approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture to the floor of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of precipitation to some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical moisture interacting with the incoming low-pressure region will cause strong rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation will cause dangerous sudden floods, mudflows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to precipitation reaching 2-3 inches per hour in places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, between 2 and 4 inches of precipitation is expected.
Due to the ungrouped sections of tropical rains, a sudden flood is possible, provided that conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to go on foot to the desert because of the possibility of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by gusty winds and dust.
The upcoming low-pressure area will bring heavy rain in places along the coast of Southern California.
Possible total precipitation of more than half an inch can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make roads slippery.
This will be the first day of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature changes in the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of sharp temperature changes in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to intensify and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States will begin a warm October with a temperature of 80 degrees – from the South Plains to part of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh's hearings.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched interesting witness testimony on Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, with broadcasters interrupting their regular programming in favor of emergency news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunken Cavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes off at a senior high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have watched it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that demonstrated this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And at Nielsen, there are usually problems with the evaluation of people who watch TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing the playoffs or the Oscars.
“The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, ran all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearings.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and as he tried to get up the elevator for a hearing at the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was being scolded, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, “You have power, but many women have power over it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks for several hours conducted a live broadcast, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do so only after understanding that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, as called for by minority Democrats.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flack's choice was a force because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against him at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics that she plans to leave the European Union, that they are "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews alongside her on the front page of the newspaper was her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who opposed her so-called “checker” Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EC have common tariffs was “completely out of place”.
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested the suspect in the death of LSU player Daitheon Simpson.
Police arrested the suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
“Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder,” Baton Rouge police said in a statement.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
“Police took the glasses from the scene and said they had Simpson’s DNA on them,” said WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to the fatal shooting at Wade.
“The cost of the institution is set at $350,000,” Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge police department released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force Department, the state's crime lab, and the Southern University Police Department are asking residents in the area for help with an investigation that would facilitate the arrest.
Louisiana State University sports director Joe Aliev thanked the district’s law enforcement agencies for their “carefulness and commitment to justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
On average, he scored 5.6 points last season, 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Louisiana State University basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what I’m always worried about,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the Papacotepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters on Saturday offered Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash were registered within 24 hours.
There was a thud in the center and there was a sense of movement.
Images on social media have shown that in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Sachimilco, there are thin layers of poplar coating on the car's windshield.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Clash of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence supporters clashed with public order police and thousands of others joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarization vote on secession from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, held back by police to protect public order, threw eggs at them and blossomed with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out as police used their batons to deter protesters.
For several hours, groups of independence fighters chanting “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” clashed with trade unionists present, shouting “Long live Spain.”
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received during the protests.
Tensions in the pro-independence region remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which was marked by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred independence, although voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of angry protesters.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who attends a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for the prospect of independence for Catalonia.
“Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired,” he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders and have found themselves either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for organizing a referendum.
Jean Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s a lot of pressure,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Selection as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after ramming a house in a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Belinagard Crescent area on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings said that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
A bullet may have been fired at some point in the car.
As a result of Mango’s strike, Livingston wins over the Rangers with a score of 1: 0
The first goal of Dolly Mangy in favor of Livingston secured them a victory
Livingston's success stunned the Rangers, and this gripped them to appoint Steven Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games to the post of manager of the club Ibrox.
Dolly Mangy's strike was excellent, as Gary Holt rose to the same level as Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team this season will not win the exit in the Premier League and next Sunday will meet with the leaders, the team "Harts", who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers in the Europa League takes on Thursday the Vienna Rapid.
Livingstone, meanwhile, has extended their win-win streak in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
“Livingston” misses the chance because of rude visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they killed, but the same direction caused the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to score at the gate, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet the blow of Craig Halket.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
This is how the main goal was achieved.
A penalty kick was made by the Rangers, and Livingston made their debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Mengu, who made a pass and scored from the center of the field.
By this point, the Rangers were dominating, but it turned out that the defense of the team was unsuitable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was practically not involved.
The same thing happened in the second half, although Alfredo Morellos actually saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was bounced by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow moved away from the second set of Livingston.
Balls constantly hit the gates of Livingston and were rebuffed, while two penalty demands, after being challenged by the Halket to replace Glen Middleton, and the requirement of punishment for playing by hand, were rejected.
“Phenomenon” from “Livingstan” – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alessdeir Lamante at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have hardly changed since their return to the top echelon, but it is worth paying tribute to Holt for the way he has stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Waral everywhere on the field.
The Rangers were not inspired.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match, they did not have the ball, only once scoring in the goal, which was something like an alarm bell for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles were seen and there were baseless lulls when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They quarreled over human rights issues, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
It has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police relied on security considerations to keep a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protesters for and against reflect disagreements over a guest who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and condemned as an autocrat by others.
Car accident in Deptford: The cyclist died in a collision with a car
The driver was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, medical workers arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said their officers are working to identify the person and report him to his next of kin.
Near that place are road fences and bus stops, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured during riots
“Six prison officers were injured as a result of riots in a maximum-security prison for men,” reports the Penitentiary Department.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 UK time on Sunday and continue to this day.
To combat the riots, which involved eight prisoners placed in one wing, the special group "Tarnada" was involved.
At the scene of the incident, employees were treated for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: “A specially trained prison staff was sent to fight those who committed riots in the Long Lartin prison.
Six of the patients were treated after their injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars.”
The Royal Long Lartin Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers for the protection of public order were summoned to prison to deal with serious riots, during which employees were attacked with balls for water polo.
Hurricane "Rose" threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which can be beneficial for arid regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but this is exactly what could happen early next week, because there are traces of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern part of the desert, which pose a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service on Monday and Tuesday published data on flash floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Las Vegas.
It is expected that on Tuesday "Rose" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of the Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts precipitation of 2 to 4 inches, with individual locations the level can reach 6 inches in the Magallion area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual final values can reach 4 inches.
For those who are outside the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be long-awaited as their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be beneficial, as droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agency, at least a little more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing an emergency drought of the second category,” reports weather.com.
First, the path of hurricane "Rose" leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore subside.
It is expected that in Mexico when a tropical storm comes, there will be an exit of rivers from the coasts in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico can be severe, which will create a significant risk of flooding.
“A total amount of precipitation is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sanlra, where precipitation of up to 10 inches is possible,” weather.com reports.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
“The main danger is expected from Rosa or its debris, it is very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the Southwestern desert of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and mudflows and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
The attack in Midsomer North: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Excelsior area of Midsomer Norton around 4am on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a “stable” condition.
"A 17-year-old boy and two others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset area," police said in a statement.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on their mobile phone of what had happened to move forward in their search.
“Kawano is reeling from the ire and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reverse the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “suffering from the ire and anger” of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually abused her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearings about her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that "on this day, Americans saw a brilliant, high-quality and courageous character" Kavanaugh.
“The vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a great history of public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the turnout of Republicans during the midterm elections.
“Five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not just late, I’m late,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for the great candied."
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to “oppose and obstruct.”
“It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday,” a senior assistant to the leadership of the parliament told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
“At least 384 people were killed and many people were missing as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves six meters (18 feet) high pounded the shore in the dusk, killing many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 was followed by a tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beaches and did not immediately flee and they became victims,” said Indonesia’s disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a briefing in Jakarta.
“Tsunami dragged cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
Aerial images published by the Disaster Management Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges rotated and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The storm continued to batter the city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Uses Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's strong earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage “widespread” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
“The casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala that is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter,” Nugroha said.
The connection in Dongala “was completely damaged,” Nugrokha said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agencies were widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, but officials said the waves came at a time when a warning was issued.
In amateur photos posted on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building crying out in despair to people on the street about the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell on the shore, dragging buildings and cars behind.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to agree on rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other essentials.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Wida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Danggala made their way successfully to the city of Palu, where workers hide in tarpaulin shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of devastation along the way,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups began dark actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were being prevented from going to Palu.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the place of distress is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Arriani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up to international assistance, but that status has not yet been achieved.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing hoped that their loved ones would miraculously be among those who would leave the bleak narrative lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Hendon Subandona, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his disciples.
“As an elder in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Handon told how, hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel's destruction spread among the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one gray checkmark, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 during the replenishment of ATMs in Newport on the Levy
“On the morning of Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who pawned notes at an ATM in Newport, Libya,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car flushed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money,” wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man "escaped from behind the Brynko worker" and hid the fur with the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes come ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", - said the creator of the show.
Along with the shortening of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it’s “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
This is me, this is you, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this is me, this
It went from “Kaney,” which means “alone,” to just Ye” – a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was in favor of the names Love and Brother Love.
West's ex-employee, Jay-Z, also did without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, while leftist student movements took root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those who study, thereby opening more free places in public universities.
“Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for machine intelligence.
“As China becomes more active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and machine intelligence specialist who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even though the U.S. lacks an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it will strive to be the first in the field of innovation of MI.
“Doubling the budget for MI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S., and we look forward to the next breakthrough in MI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next great achievement of MI will be in the United States,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Machine Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Miflin Harkurt, is the chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most renowned MI+ companies, Faice.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player Athel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese office in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Competition of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked if there would be a next one to help identify the next ones.
“U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get government grants,” Lee said.
“This is not China taking away academic leaders; this is a corporation,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on MI in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
“In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of MI,” he said.
The State Council of China in July 2017 released a plan for the development of next-generation machine intelligence.
“The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Organization (NSF), it currently invests more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to create a National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not monitored the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims its northern neighbor's name is a claim on its territory, and has vetoed NATO and the European Union.
In June, both governments struck a deal given the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required to hold a referendum.
The issue of voting in the referendum suggests: "You are in favor of membership in NATO and the EC with the adoption of an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not a binding legal force, enough members of parliament have said they will consider the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A name change would require more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no violations had been reported until 1 a.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old voter in Skopje’s capital, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica and his son Dushka voted for a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Uladzimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and laying out chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want unification with heads raised, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have the honor.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming number will be in favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of “yes” will be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia said that 30 to 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's TV channel showed 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguera of Manchester City passes to the gate through the entire defense of the "Brighton"
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Raheem Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton by winning Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguer did it with ease.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three defenders of Brighton before hitting the open field.
Then Aguero was among the four green shirts.
He went over one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker with the first touch in the penalty gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right stroke to bypass the goalkeeper of "Brighton" Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the net.
“Aguera has some problems with his legs,” the city’s governor, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal in that same moment.”
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguera received this ball in the depths of the territory of the "Brighton".
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sein made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far bar.
Attacking "Sky Blues" directed the ball into the net before he jumped over the border.

Sherzer wants to play the role of "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no particular reason to push for a new start.
But the ever-competitive Sherzer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the "Calarado Rocky", but only if there are still consequences of the playoffs for Rocky, who remain in the lead after one game with the "Los Angeles Dodgers" in the North West.
The Rocks won at least a one-time spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first division title.
“Even though we’re playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is going to be so that the game is likely to be at the highest level of all that I’ve encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Sherzer the ball in such a situation.
Sherzer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a session of the KPZ on Thursday and will be on Sunday on his usual vacation.
Washington's Prowshun 18/07 with 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 pitches this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his choice of the Supreme Court of Breta Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the turnout of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is under threat in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m fighting for big candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening now.
And they are determined to regain power, using any necessary means, you see, the meanness, the filth.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to kill to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
According to his words, the Democrats intend to “oppose and obstruct”.
“And you’ve seen this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, mean, reverse, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous recognition of Senator of the democratic group Diana Feinstein, who received a high rating from the audience.
“Do you remember her name?
Did you get a copy of the paper?
Uh, what.
No, I don’t expect it — it was a very bad nonverbal language — the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an insult to those who express their opinion.
"When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
In the end, I am the last in a row of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome – everything to express their opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
A statement from the meeting, which was well-received by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party on Friday, said: “We want these meetings to be meaningful and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, this was the kind of meeting I had on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not that and the promise of a “more good, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever was.
It is becoming increasingly clear that in the Labour Party, different views are not allowed, and every opinion is evaluated from the other side of the view, whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously believed I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a step back and took positions with which I would not agree – on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a barrage of insults on social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the center’s policies, saying I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I'm fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist bullying, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of abuse levels.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “uncertainty” or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice that urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy spurned by the Thatcher government’s neglect of my schooling, I’ve strived to champion the best public services for those who need them most – whether it’s a local resident or a councillor.
"I have never hidden my political views, including in the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that when a country is heading for a Brexit that is damaging to the home, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my allegiance to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it’s my constituents, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise there will be no threat of an election being overturned, and political expediency will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air-Melrose 38 - 17: Unbeatable Air on Top
Two later attempts may have somewhat skewed the final result, but without a doubt, Air has earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League game of Tennent.
Now they are leading the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances that made them masters, coach Peter Murchie Merch had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give Ayr what he deserves, he's braver than we are."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Frasier Klime, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggot grasped at the unrealized attempt.
Klimov stretched Air's lead with a penalty kick before, right in the break, he scored and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Air's in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Rich, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruard Nott, which was stretched, and after a re-start, Aire moved on through Stafford McDowell's attempt, implemented by Klimov.
Air, acting as Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struhan Hutchinson received a yellow card for kicking Klim without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson landed behind Aire.
Klimov carried out his attempt, which he did again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong in the penalty area and sent the flanker Gregory Henry to the fifth attempt of the field hosts.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of the game Ford Kieran is going to enter the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he writes, and is co-starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphile.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series of shows, and it seems that Kernan plans to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kernan was hoping to take part in a "flourishing Glasgow trade".
"Our Sea": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings under the blue flag.
In the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "The sea is our right".
That’s our duty, that’s our duty.
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over 19th-century resources is still alive – as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may have peaked in recent decades as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it is waiting for a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense negotiations, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Eva Morales is Bolivia’s charismatic president, facing a controversial re-election battle next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and this will not change much, even if it does.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to make a decision on the territory of Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice is issued only six months after the final arguments were considered, indicates that the case “was not complicated”, – said the Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's affairs, the past four years may have pushed it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, the militant rhetoric of Morales lost the remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velte, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadailla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political foothold.
“Bali will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“It’s an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
He spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restoring nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ree says it’s an “unnecessary dream” that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to the declaration of an end to the war in Korea will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant disarmament steps at first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, we saw the newest line in massive headwear on the way to the stores in your cities
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium a lot of unusual headwear for their collection SS19, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram won the popularity of impractical hats, whose designers sent their creations to the podium.
A distinctive feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, decorated with wide feather-like fields that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included gem-decorated watermelons, a wizard hat, and even pineapples, but they weren't meant to keep your head warm.
Tim Brown also showed a selection of intricate masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks were sewn-on lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them resembled a scuba gear with a tube and safety goggles, and the other is similar to a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue to strongly adhere to the huge attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can make their way into our daily lives.
The huge-sized hats go on their heels to "La Bomba", a two-foot-wide straw hat that can be seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label for a very uncomfortable hat, which was dissolved in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in a swimsuit.
A dark orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia trim and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has made a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of speech is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools retain achievements in academic excellence, this has been going on since 2018 with another excellent exam result backed by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
Over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing the best level of work for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individualized school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams of this year, we see that languages occupy the first places in the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Chinese language learning, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French, and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish, will also reach the Spanish level.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as a subject are chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons employers cited for difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a future career.
With more promising jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you choose, if you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you will have such skills for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage – 15 per cent.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the country's future, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference to Scotland's youth.
This has to be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The beginning of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will go, still need to be determined.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudeau wrote that James is likely to play in limited minutes.
According to the practice, which developed this week. James was asked about his plans for "six pre-season game schedules."
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign shares.
It's the first of five Trump speeches scheduled for next week, including stops at friendlies, Tennessee and Mississippi.
In confirming the incoming vote to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's speech start tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia on the Internet below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely this week to consider hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been struggling with allegations of sexual harassment with an expected Senate confirmation vote for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help the Republicans who are facing an election in November.
So President Trump’s campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at “boosting the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today’s action could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and grab the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who leads the polls.
“It’s not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come in to try to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Moves to Fight to Keep Hopes Alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's fourth session may have been exactly what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The pendulum of the swinging impulse is a completely invented sports concept, in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
“They had an advantage with six points, and now they have four, so I think we’re going through this with a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Sleep said, walking throughout the day.
The advantage of Europe, of course, is four points ahead, and in the game there are twelve more.
Americans, Spitch says, feel like they've had a bit of a breeze, and they have a lot to hope for, not least because of the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Spite was deadly from t-shirts to green and is an example.
These garton shouts of celebration grew louder as his round lasted, and he sank a decisive blow to play matches on four pitches when he and Thomas were down two by two.
His punch, which allowed them to win matches on the 15th, was met with a similar cry, like the one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
“We just need to go deeper and worry about our own match,” Spiti said.
All of these players are gone.
18 points to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players who have gained more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
The "Malywood" were the only pair that did not do the bogga on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the bogga on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday afternoon.
It's happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this tumultuous crowd, and it confirms that they are the players to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun goes down on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or the Molineurs.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
The talk of European glory is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning buffet, when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
Boggi and two doppelgangers on the front nine dug a Spanish and a Swede hole, from which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you with your hole.
Four-ball matches and fours are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the composition of the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not follow, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far become the better team and taken on a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the US team is committed to a fight that some doubted, especially in the States.
Europe reach the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-goal and four-goal matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Malinari led the fight against two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the results at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Byrne, trying to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American dissatisfaction agency in the morning, receiving a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a four-ball match by winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
In order to save the trophy, Jim Furik's side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Malinary, dubbed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they are superbly strengthened to defeat the downed Woods and American recruiter Brian Decambot 5 and 4.
Woods, who led through two games on Saturday, showed a random spike in glamour, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in four-goal matches and four-goal and seven-goal bouts in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on x four-ball matches, returned to partner Henryk Stanson in four-ball matches before defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – takes the one and second place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-times-winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for Americans with two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in four-ball matches and came back later to beat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned from a four-point deficit, which goes alone, although the owners of Furik only need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they will succeed.
North Korea says 'no way' it will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations was continuing sanctions that increase mistrust of the United States, and in such circumstances the country could not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ry Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting tests at nuclear and missile sites, dismantling the nuclear test zone and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way in the first place to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded because it took gradual steps, his statement turned out to be significant in that he did not deny
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the path to “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump promised to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 war in Korea, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States of America first insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even opposes ‘declaring an end to the war,’” Ri says.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an indispensable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to deepen our disbelief.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, not the United States, were a party to this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be so deadlocked.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year when he spoke at the United Nations, the General Assembly argued that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “rocker”-suicide.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there would be much more to do and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are arguing at the UN. The Security Council said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we are confident in full, final and verifiable denuclearization.”
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in a bid to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the Security Council cauldrons. The General Assembly then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over several hours of negotiations ended with a statement to the visa that he was making demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to eliminate the missile launcher and nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
Trump said Kim said the “appropriate measures” he expects are a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take a course on proper rest.
Harvard University's new course this year is supposed to teach students more sleep, and has the goal of fighting the culture of studying at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
Inspired by a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, “Why did they tell me this just now, in the last year of training?”
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course taught by a student explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were often sleep-deprived for a week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dormitory room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of bedtime habits.
At the next stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they should know this as well as everyone knows about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Cheysler added.
According to him, the culture of night parties still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be an increasing problem.
“Adequate good quality sleep should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid being overweight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler develop the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to request all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before enrolling in the university.
Professor Cheysler recommended students the ability to set a watch to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted from monitors and LED lights that can change the daytime mode, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1:0 Rangers: Menga scores a goal for Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Mangy's goal convinced that Steven Gerrard would not receive a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first win on his way to a 4-1 triumph in St. John's in February, but Gary Holton's team is already carrying Gerard's second defeat as manager with 18 games to leave behind eight points behind the Ladbrokes Hearts premiership leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, inspired by the goal, did not look like he was suffering a defeat.
At the same time as the "Rangers" drops to sixth place, "Livingston" rose to third place, behind the Hibernians with a difference in the balls.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems after forward Columbus Spence has to be treated for a head injury after he got an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight player changes, causing Ira not to play in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under number 11, which allowed him to pick up a point from the Hearts last week, and was delighted with how well they were getting around their rivals at every turn.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Livigston made more attempts to score the ball.
They were supposed to kill in two minutes, when Mengie first directed the ball through Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took this chance.
Jacobs Kagan's successful penalty kick came as a surprise to Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to strike a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game more hoped to kill than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marelas was certainly due to be fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Steven Lawless collided on the field, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept Colombia's complaint.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly almost gave a goal to Lassan Coulibaly and the effective attack Ovi Eharia.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute, Livi may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to fans a good game.
Again, the Rangers were unable to break through Jacobs's gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for the opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly's break with Ryan Kent, and this had an effective effect when the attacker broke through to Marelas, but the impressive Kelly ran in and blocked the shot.
But Livingstone continued to please visitors, playing the game that they liked, and Lithgow and Halket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was able to prevail only in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to confront Jacobs before Lithgow went to the bench.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton happened once again after the penalty, when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
The inventor of the Geiger counter.
Page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and IF... the day of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crowned Ones", in which those seemingly little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms being radioactive in the minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, is this really the right time now?”!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, which bears his name, continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine could help the immune system “see” cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system “see” bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine, as it were, teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" the protein common in many cancer cells, and then re-introduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells saw that ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method involves getting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the lab so they can "see" the HER2 protein common to many cancer cells, and then being reintroduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky from the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anticancer cells that fight breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer,” said Professor Berozofsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "teaching" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began the discussion in support of Trump, wearing the title of MAGO, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during Saturday night Kanye West was humiliated after a performance where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song called “The Ghost City” in the evening, when he was wearing the “Make America Great Again” hat, he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times have I talked to white people and they said, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the trial of the sexual assault case of Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, West's words fell into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make a mockery of West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a difficult time behind the scenes.
They were staring at me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap.
They were staring at me.
“And then they say I’m in the wrong place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the gibbous place?” “Speaking that he’s” will put on my Skperman cap, which meant he can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, the hearings were withdrawn at least twice, and representatives of the SNS were confused by the message from Veraity. "The whole studio was silent."
West was hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA party, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits, thank you for your support."
But a talk show host, Karen Hunter, wrote that West is just who he is, and that's always great.
“But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or clothing, or by supporting their ‘art’, which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that now his "official name is Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music, who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in the restaurant "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a restaurant in east Belfast attacked a second man on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamor, police said.
The accused is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the state prosecutor's office.
The star of “Game of Thrones” Kit Harington embraced idealized brutality.
Keith Harington is known for his swinging sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Game of Thrones" in the action movie medieval raw material HBO
But the 31-year-old actor received the stereotype of a hero macho, which means that young boys often feel more rigid for respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said he believed “something happened” and asked how to address the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
The cat, who recently married his “Game of Thrones” neighbor Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he feels the power to solve this problem.
"I feel personally strong guy, - when we were wrong with courage?" - he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?”
The cat believes that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality because of the very male characters.
He continued: “What lies in the beginning and why is this taught?
Why teach on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change it?
It's obvious that something is wrong with young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series will end, and he will leave the battlefield of the series and will not make docs or sequels to "Game of Thrones".
From November, Keith will begin reviving True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical filmmaker with his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor reported that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best occasion to complete “Game of Thrones”.
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life is here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who is in love with Keith's hero John Snow in this fantasy series, awarded an "Amy".
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"However, the number of such people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has decreased to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Because of conservative values in the country, approximately 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread by insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data leak, danger and conspiracy theory by her MPs
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed accusations that her staffer posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that there are claims against the members of the far right wing and their sites.
“Lies, lies, and a lot of disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the US. Meaning. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Oryn Hatch, both from Utah.
The information, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, appeared online on Thursday.
The leak took place some time after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source’s IP address was linked to Waters’ office and shared information with an employee of the Waters team,” Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s the rejection that causes anger,” Fleischer wrote.
This shows that she does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get caught.
They don't have to be rude to themselves.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and gentle.
Fleischer compared Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too outspoken during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Nawara, the Republican Party candidate who is running and participating in the midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
“It’s a rezoning when the truth is revealed,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these false statements.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will take legal responsibility for all of their actions, which are disruptive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again strikes at the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British bias, and this bias seems to be present in the comedy and action franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title "The Revival of Johnny English".
Is there any way to explain how stupid we are when we talk about the future of technology?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creatures that he did for non-English audiences in cinema.
It is known that he is a secret agent who, despite his wily claims to glamour, turned out to be a bit like Clouseau with Mr Bean's features and a bit of a taco guy who made a single note in the Choir of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally, his character was based on the traveler and the international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are some pleasant moments that did not exist before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades tapping a little on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but the humor feels weak, and so it is surprising especially when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Impossible confidently offer comedy as the main part.
The humor feels as if it's not just for adults but for children, and even Johnny English's senseless misadventures aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in Bean's persona.
The UK's long-standing problem is a serious one.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the on-duty agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed-race figure who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Theresa-May, but there is nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be exposed, she will have to involve some of those already retired.
This means that things are getting more complicated for Johnny English himself: he now works as the sixth teacher in several chic institutions and gives lessons on how to be an undisguised operator: some good examples here as English offers Academy of Music lessons in espionage.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Currently, Bo has a marriage tied to a submarine commander, the role of which Vicky Pepperdine performed a little in vain.
In this way, Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting with a beautiful woman, Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve the problems with UK hackers: the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their action with urgent things: disguise as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board the luxurious Volta yacht; English commits pure anarchy, because he tries to use the headset of virtual reality, and the Internet.
All the moments are stretched out for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, in which there is quite a lot of baby in the TV.
Pretty good material.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkins a role that really showcases his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that a plan is being developed to pay Britons a four-day working week with pay as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan if the British work only four days a week, but they are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business executives to hand over to workers the results of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was seen that the employees of the future enjoy the three-day weekend, but will still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the economic program of the party and plans to send the country to support the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen now, but a four-day working week is an idea that fits the party’s views and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's efforts are generally not supported.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not the goal of party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to return power from “merciless directors” and “managers” to utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also stipulate that the current water shareholder may not receive back the entire package of shares, as the Labour government may make a “calculation” on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to bring workers into the boards of companies and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that FBI investigators working with Kavanaugh must change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh was postponed to the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises as to whether the conclusions of the bureau of Republican senators will be able to provide support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Paley asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about “Sense”: whether the FBI can reveal everything that can lead to change.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I’m sorry,” said Kanye.
“I said, going to the court session: I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked about the reason for the accusation, asking, “Did you do this?”
He was a good and kind man.”
Graham's vote, however, appears to be final.
“I think Brett Kavanaugh decided that this would be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett resolutely denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
"And all those whom she called could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival: an annual music event that has a very impressive line-up of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, over seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on a large lawn in Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy a concert by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, as well as learn about the true purpose of the event – ending poverty and destitution by 2030.
The International Festival of Citizenship, launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Project Against Poverty by an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "hold a promotion", be a volunteer, write an e-mail to the leader of the country, call any other figures and raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civic Festival for 12 years and whether it was able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” – people feel like they’re doing a good thing by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival say that they have recorded more than 19 million "shares" from their fans, who are trying to achieve various goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to meet commitments of more than $37 billion that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group provided 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that have already been committed or collected.
According to the group's estimates, secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnering with UK-based investors and performers, “helping children develop fully”, a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid undernourishment in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of undernourishment in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were held calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a “food aid” project that reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the site’s frequent questions, “what makes you think we can end poverty?”
The global festival responded: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will suffer defeat and failure.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are one of a number of people who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to “lock” to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
“Washington can turn to the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets of the EU and the Middle East,” said US Secretary of State Ryan Zink, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy in the same way as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to ensure the openness of sea lanes, and if necessary, to organize a blockade, so that their energy certainly does not get to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia more or less balances and replaces fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “one-sided country” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, employees of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “wrong” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is being created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's tough opposition to this project originates in the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German organization representing the industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, says the senator from the state of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at Halioki City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and put our dysfunctional government in order, and I’m also talking about women in the highest office,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
During a speech at the city hall, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m extremely concerned about what Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, the FBI needs to conduct an investigation before the vote.”
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Studies at Safalka University/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the potential 2020 run-off include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would formally make a decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Trak Palin
26-year-old Track Pauline spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my son is going through on his return, I can compare to the results of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries our soldiers are coming back with in other families,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest a "ballet question" and said her son, along with other war veterans, "returns a little different, hardened, coming back with the question of whether there is the kind of respect that soldiers, pilots, other military fought for, giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, thwarting an attempt to report domestic violence, carrying a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new policy on the provision of shelter
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims of gang oppression or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical memo in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to the harbor policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his friends from the hard gang” raped her, but the US authorities denied her the harbor on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which receive the largest number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia’s Attorney General Carl Reissin said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislative experience by states, countries, and the world.”
"Federal law requires that applications for asylum be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analytical note says.
Lawyers also said in a note that policies that deny immigrants worsen the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and “create the necessary jobs.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer shelter victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Acceptance is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views,” Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
The haven has never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. While trying to find those who survived, the number of dead doubled
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
“Everything is very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her young son with the temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the car "fast" brings the body.
The water is very small.”
Residents began to return to their ruined homes, disassembling wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who fractured his spine and shoulder, are outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street due to strong, repetitive jolts.
Tears appeared in his eyes when he remembered the feeling of strong underground tremors in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to waste.
I was clamped under the ruins of a wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard the woman call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘threats’ using ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the American daily, extolling the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress election. This accusation is debunked by China.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials have called in an interview with Reuters a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, the result of which was the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts said, have been imposed to hurt exporters such as Iowa entrepreneurs who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Bransted, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging America’s good tradition of free speech and free press by printing paid ads on the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
“And if you look at the newsstands in Beijing, you will find not so many votes against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron heel of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers has declined the offer" to publish his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are pushing back women voters on the eve of the midterm elections from the Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
While many prominent Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will be hit back, especially by women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," said Grant Richard, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Richard said he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be tremendous,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say that they are already tall, and that’s true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t like the president but often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her allegations of a Supreme Court candidate for sexual violence, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there could be a strong backlash.
“For the Republican Party, it’s become a mess,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets into office. It’s about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” noted news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided on the issue of the rightness of Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more stands for the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are confident or not very confident in Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they are confident or not very confident in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh may or probably have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push by Flack, the FBI is investigating the allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, when he was drunk, sought her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and who has permission to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant "domination of the world".
“We need to do this now,” he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create “own online data repositories” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, fan club, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available all at once on the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this “personal enhancement of the potential with the help of data.”
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, process and necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers working on the contract project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brunners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce complete changes if all of their business models are reviewed immediately.
“We’re not trying to force them out.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the new age of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: honoring the priest awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Belenglise and Leacourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rushden, County Narthamptonshire, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone at a parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wang, said it was “very symbolic” that the stone opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Wang led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through thick fog and under heavy gun and machine gun fire of the enemy."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, independently seizing the gun and knocking out three units.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wang, also laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said that "it is a great honor to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many give."
MMA fans waited all night to see the Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead.
Just imagine you've been stuck up all night to watch a packaged transmission from the Bellator 206, and then you're denied viewing the main event.
The program from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on the British Channel 5.
And at six o'clock in the morning, when Gerard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK just went crazy when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, specially waiting for this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter called the switch to a children's cartoon as "someone's stupid joke."
Asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: “According to a state decree at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and needed to be switched to a children’s program.”
"Yes, Peppa Pig."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they will work on a programme in the future to keep British viewers in mind.
“I think we will discuss the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, we can resolve this issue,” said Cocker.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday, and we won’t be able to solve it until Sunday in our time, and it’s Monday in their time.
But we are doing our best.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem, believing that it was a technical error.
But it seemed to be a government policy.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to please the fans, but we overreacted.
It's an ugly situation."
"Discs of a deserted island": Tom Daly felt "minor" because of sexuality
Olympic water-jumping champion Tom Daley said he grew up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality – but this gave him motivation on the road to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s “Disc of a Deserted Island” program, host Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional host of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
As a man stranded on a deserted island, on Laverne's first show, Daly said that as a child he felt "less" than everyone else because "society didn't accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, “I still believe that this feeling of being different and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a significant LGBT activist and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year urged countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion, because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – an American screenwriter, directors and producers Dastina Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he says the age difference doesn't matter.
“If you go through this at such a young age” – he got to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer – he said that it was difficult to find a peer who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son's name was Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that his "perspectives are completely" changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I needed to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
“This is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son is also named as his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to sit in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize he wasn’t immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’d been dreaming about all my life – jumping into the water in front of my fans at the Olympic Games, that’s the best feeling,” he said.
This also influenced the choice of the song – Proud by Heather Small – which found in it a response in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are still running.
Discs of a Deserted Island can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 UK Summer Time.
Mikelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson on Sunday will set a record by playing his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get back in shape so that this event does not become unhappy.
Michelson, who will play in this competition, which is held every two years, a record 12th time, team captain Jim Furik sat on the bench of spares for Saturday's phorbols.
Instead of being at the center of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time cup winner split his days between cheerleader work and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not an ideal choice for the difficult field of Le Golf National, where inaccurate strokes are severely punished.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Michelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Malinari, who together with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the beginning of 12 singles matches, start with success, Michelson's match can be extremely important.
F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer expressed confidence in this player, but he could not say anything more.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He’s very confident in himself.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot to the teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't want to play two games.
I wanted to do more, but that's how we played.
He’s on the field like everyone else.”
Mikelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been the same as the achievements in individual games.
In Michelson's 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said that his presence brought the team a benefit.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to joke about people and just a very good person to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to parry his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team a lot more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Byrne knows that the big gap may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the individual games of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where a European team led by Sevo Balesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You’re constantly reminding yourself that at Walderham we had a great advantage and we won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn said after reviewing how the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, and scored 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“The story shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end.
We'll have to play tomorrow.
Go out on the field and do it right.
Until it's on the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, this is what we will focus on.
I’m constantly saying this, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side are the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players played on the heavy golf course, Byrne added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
There will be a game tomorrow, but that's different.
It's great when you're on the field with your partner and everything is going well, but if you play alone, then your real golfing talents come true.
Here's what you need to convey to the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we need to leave the partner, we need to go and also show all the best as an individual player."
Unlike Byrne, his rival Jim Furick hopes for a better individual game of his athletes than the one they demonstrated in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the "Miracle in Medina."
“I remember every word of it,” he said, answering the question of how Ben Cranshaw, the 1999 captain, set his players up for the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you always want to have the quick start you’ve seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the speed increases, then the greatest pressure is placed on those who play matches in the middle.
We made the right schedule and put the players the way we liked it. You know, tomorrow we're trying to get some magic."
Thomas has been tasked with starting the playoffs and playing against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter playing against top golfers.
“I put my players in that order because I think that’s how I’m going to close everything,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn said of his choice for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to faulty systems and constantly increasing prices, according to local media reports.
The descent of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the completely new class of frigates Baden-Wurttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to enter service in 2014, but the problems that arose after the construction hindered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, for example, reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between maintenance – newer frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships – which could allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country – will become obsolete by the time they finally enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about numerous "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships have only 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further updates.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of the ships of this class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the price of the entire project – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – although initially it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems accruing with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defense committee in the German parliament, said that the Navy “has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions.”
He said that the problem is increasing over time, because the old ships are written off, and there are no ships to replace them.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments overheard the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to identify how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by scientists at the National Society for the Conservation of Scottish Monuments deals with small bats and also with the stormy long-eared bats of Dabanton in the Inverweg Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in the main places of this area to monitor the actions of bats throughout the season.
Society workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the records will determine the frequency of the calls of bats, as well as which bats do what.
The residence map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, an adviser to the National Wildlife Conservation Society, hopes the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to maintain forests for the habitat of bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky ribbons for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
The words are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal life, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in the way of flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, checks of places of residence and, at times, rescue activities.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Trive Estate in Dumfries and Hawthorne, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is an ideal area for bats.
"Here, in Triv, we have just a great place for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don’t know much about bats, so our work here and in other estates will help to understand more what they need for a better life.”
He emphasizes the importance of checking for the presence of bats before repairing the property, since it is possible to unintentionally destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
Bats are under protection and they are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Ferrall, an employee of the Organisation for the Protection of Bats in Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many of the species we don’t even know how their populations live.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are set to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations of rape "fake news", saying people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
The forward of the national team of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo reached out to 142 million of his subscribers hours after the charges were published, calling the message “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s news is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner in front of the camera.
“They want to make an announcement on my name.
It's OK.
They want to get famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy and good man,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel magazine on charges they called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Scherts said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount that matches the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights."
As if having a place, the incident occurred in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Having met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorgo seem to have returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as written in the documents of the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after this Ronaldo knelt down and said that at "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but according to the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to reopen the charges because she feels a moral trauma in the case.
At the time, as if this case had a place, Ronaldo was going to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘forever sorry’ for carmaker’s loss
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s top carmaker after Brexit, business minister Greg Clarke said on Wednesday.
He added that he was "disturbed" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby, in half.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border as a result of Brexit without an agreement could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Bernaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director in Bernascone.
Other carmakers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be conducted if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that carmakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on an “exactly on time” basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, leading to delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it will be impossible to keep a factory in Derby for more than a day's supply of parts, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s “Plan Chequers” on future relations with the EU “are made precisely to avoid these border checks”.
“We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will not only make today a success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue to operate successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will not last, but has warned in the future that the added cost will reduce the plant's competitiveness and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuvalyris, who has been working at Bernaston for 24 years and is the union’s coordinator, said that union members are very concerned: “In my experience, if jobs are cut, they won’t be renewed.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a clear plan for our future relationship with the EU that is credible.”
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week,” while the fight around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
To fire Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been fueling the fire of Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of 25 amendments.
Rosenstein denied this.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would take place on Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a fight at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that featured Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further slowed down the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet set, maybe this week, maybe next week. I think, rather, a week later, taking into account all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the most new information.”
Some journalists are ready to challenge her claim: Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host of the program, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of briefings is caused by not scorning TV reporters who “work for the public,” though she added, “I agree with the fact that they work for the public.”
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more press briefings than any president before him,” she said, adding without any specific facts: “We’ve studied these numbers.”
The briefings are taking place, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s much better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen how we’ve done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, where you can ask a question directly to the president, replace briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions about whether he is leaving the White House or taking part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high-ranking foreign guests.
Press conferences are rarely held by the president himself.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagantly appeared before reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to an employee from EU countries in the health care system of Scotland before Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to the EU staff working in Scotland's health system to express his thanks on behalf of the country and to wish them to remain after Brexit.
Jen Freeman sent the letter less than six months before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of applications for residence from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal of our country continued. They lead to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government also hastened to prepare for the scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, also benefiting patients and our communities.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Sunday game that his team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the break.
“He crossed the side line and suddenly fell,” Reed said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercombe oxygen still on the field before putting it on the force and moving it to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is “no information about what kind of injury it was,” and Tennessee State will try to identify when a player was injured.
Abercombe, a sophomore athlete, holds the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full intercepts, giving just 18 intercepts per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty
According to the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the perceived success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters.
The increase in the state duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters, as well as to give affordable housing. It is aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in state duty is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's homeless housing program.
The increase in the current state duty, including higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for new buyers to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “ghost cities”, because a large number of buyers from abroad spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state duty for young buyers to facilitate the purchase of first homes.
He accused major construction firms of keeping high real estate prices by seizing land and not using it, and called on Mrs May to lift affordable housing quotas to address the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including controlling rents and ending “unjustified” evictions.
He also wants to give more power to local councils in the field of housing construction.
Mrs May said: “Last year I stated that I will dedicate my work as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – life for every new generation must be made better.
This is a sign of our imperfect market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy property as easily as UK workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.”
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to lead the Scottish national team”
Coach “Sunderland” Jack Ross said that his main ambition – one day to become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is carrying out the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the first.
He switched to this job in the summer, after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn’t work out,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“I grew up often sick of Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
I'm going to be a good coach when I'm a good coach."
Among Ross' predecessors as coach of "Sunderland" Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paula di Kanya.
Former Aloe Athletic coach says he had no fear of such famous names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I'm going to be very successful in answering the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is certainly in the Premier League,” he said.
“Not only will I get him back there, but I will consider my work successful only if I can get the club back there.”
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Alois to return from the third league and turned Saint-Miraine from a loser who almost made it to the Championship the following season's winner.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling work at Aloe, he said, “It was a really important choice.”
“I really believed that the coaching job was what I needed, even more than a game.
It sounds amazing, because I've worked well, earned well, and reached certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what you need.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing this, and for me this is the best time for my entire adult life.”
The full interview can be heard on the Sportsound programme on Saturday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 UK Summer Time.

The hot summer has boosted profits for British pubs struggling to survive, but has brought pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the statistics of the group of pubs and bars, sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants the sales volume decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consulting business group CGA, which collected these statistics, said: "The prolonged sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English team in the final of the World Cup, means that in July there was more than in June, when the pubs increased sales by 2 times.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks have so far shown the best results as opposed to restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food also get sunburned, though not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages rose by 6.6 percent, and sales of food fell by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and accommodation analyst, said: “These results are making a trend that we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, as sales have fallen by 4.8 percent per year, and this is very unpleasant if prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for food-focused operators, and time will tell whether lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployments.
The British Pubs, Bars and Restaurants sales tracking tool Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, which have a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an important benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The study found that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of “fake Insta” pages
It's the fear of being exposed to sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “core” account that shows parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to a photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has sparked fears that sexual content will be published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept “clean” “core” accounts to show to their parents, and also kept private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website learned that she had been called by others to “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of teens aged 11 to 18 had two profiles each, with half of them admitting they had secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teens want to create places online where neither parents nor teachers will find them."
Aylide Doyle will be the “Voice of Athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer member of the council at the body's annual general meeting.
Doyle – Scotland’s most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described this event as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her experience at a wide variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
“Ailid has great respect for Scotland, the UK and the global athletic community, and we are confident that Scotland’s athletics will benefit greatly from her work in the council,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won gold at the 200 and 400 meters distances at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two more gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert at the BBC, can not walk after experiencing a microstroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'll be able to fix it and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing healing exercises!
Thank you for the message of support!»
Advertising milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The milk pump company shared the view, releasing an ad comparing nursing women to cows being breastfed.
To mark the launch of what’s being called “the world’s first breast pump,” consumer company Elvie has released an Iranian music video-based ad to show the freedom this device gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cow-swaddle to a song where there are these words: "Yes, I give myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my chest."
And he sang, "Dai, dai, I feed the children, dai, dai, I give my women."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a heated debate on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was mixed, many said that it is a horror of dairy production.
“It’s a very bad decision to use the car to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to give milk, but only their children are taken away in a few days,” one viewer wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who don’t have children taken away from them?”
Someone added, “Such an ill-advised advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she considered the song "fun".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one of those if I had one of those lipsticks.
Having a baby makes me feel like I'm pregnant.
It's a bit crazy, but I liked it.
It’s a genius product,” she wrote.
Another comment: "A very entertaining advertisement aimed at mothers who suck milk with a pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and hear themselves "cows".
This ad does not excite or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel cow-like.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is hidden inconspicuously in a bra for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows you to keep children and even leave the house during the operation of the device.
Ana Balaryn, Partner and Creative Director at Mother, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the suction of milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating in a fun and gentle way how a new milk pump will bring extreme freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk pump is getting into the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes from Marta Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to jeopardize their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other adult members of the household would be required to file fingerprints and the data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, spoke to Congress about the arrests by the agency of dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had not previously had criminal convictions.
“About 80 percent of persons who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we continue to pursue such people,” Mr. Olbens said.
To speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, and, according to shelter workers, the standard period was 60 days earlier.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status immigration judge will have to use the video link, rather than be present in court in person.
Those who do not have the means to help will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escapes.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are found to be much more pronounced, as signs that the child is in distress are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent town without providing time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that has been going on in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, based on the fight against terrorism, and “will be dealt with accordingly.”
“They should leave immediately and not put any conditions,” he said at the session of the Assembly.
Muallem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus intends to continue “to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
About 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mostly serving as instructors and advisers to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land contingent in this war-torn country is more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions for return were favourable and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that keep refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re just trying to be humane.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "exact terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, in the near future to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem expressed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump is running for a second term.
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberals hope, impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency prematurely.
And this, without a doubt, will be "The most dramatic presidential final in all history!"
At the moment, there is no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" drew 3.5 million viewers to the screen and surpassed cable TV ratings on the evening when the show aired.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” says Neil Bear, the director of the ABC drama The Successor, about a Cabinet member who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Scovell, the masked screenwriter of the comedy and author of the book "A Couple of Funny Details and Some Hard Truths about the Penetration into the Club of Hollywood Boys," there is another theory.
She mentions a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
He told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
- What? - I asked.
He replied, “Because he amuses me,” Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is also something that can be enjoyed.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington can be just as decisive for the future as the Roar vs. Wade case, depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet, if you watch for the sixth hour as a group of experts discusses Bob Woodward’s use of “information not for printing” in the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 porridge-skin jacket (clothes lined with pride, as written in The Washington Post), and the implications of the passage
I'll never look at Super Mario like I did before.
“Part of what he does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show that he shows every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars (Stars as Pawn), about the changing cast of the show and Trump’s character.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll fall behind the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat outside the windows of his house on the north bank of Kauai, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
It couldn't have happened, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember kids when we were doing these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

Foreign money flows poured into a tough pre-election race of midterm elections in the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district has been hit by a cash flood due to a change in congressional district boundaries that has seen two candidates running for the same seat.
The newly repainted suburban area of Pittsburgh surrounds the Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in last spring's by-elections.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally credited in favor of the Republicans.
The election race in the new 17th arrondissement caused a decline in the company's funding by the financial groups of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCP) and the Republican National Committee (RNC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in a widely-enlightened re-election in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 20 points.
The Democrats have a slight advantage over the Democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then retreated.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled into a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent non-recognition decisions of Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meetings concluded, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that would follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively stop considering the issue of punishing El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favor of holding the event.
And three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
The White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by another analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the history
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on a possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, examples of which currently have very strong evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of a collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in an attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability to that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps ultimately to jurors among his peers.
There are many “ifs,” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just as there are those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The story revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, Americans are facing several of these tipping points.
What happens if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote that last year he proposed to secretly record the words of the president and reflected on his suitability.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times’ account is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not comprehensive or fair, or if he is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual violence and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Shabbat candles on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers are optimistic on the eve of the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to confidently withdraw from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from playing for the first time in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard.
“It was a significant match for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” says the 31-year-old footballer.
“We started the game thinking we could get something, and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored the ball in the end, but overall the draw was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we picked ourselves up and we had the better half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another important night for European football.
I hope we will be able to earn three points, but it will be a difficult game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans in the stands, I am sure that we will be able to overcome them and show a good game.
Last year was definitely tough, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope we can move forward, surpass the result of last season and achieve success.”
Women are losing their sleep because of the fear of retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of what they wanted for themselves care, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take steps to discuss it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Discuss this with your spouse and children: your family won't be ready to help you if you don't make your wishes known in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
It can also help to find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or you can self-insure your life – provided you have the money.
Resolve cases with legal documents: provide for court battles.
Get a medical care proxy to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the specialists carry out your wishes in case you can't speak.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing a power of attorney for financial management.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure the payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about the prohibited drugs and the presence of allergies?
Write down these details in writing to be ready.
“Not only financial issues play a role, but also the professionalism of doctors,” adds Martin.
“What kind of medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
We need to plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man received several hits from a pneumatic rifle as he was walking home at night.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 a.m. local time, as an "accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life, the police ask witnesses to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline on the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The regency is an administrative unit with the status below the province, in 2017 it had 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongalo have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ocheh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Ocheh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 occurred on one of the islands of Mentawa outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Piji Jaya Regency in Ocheh Province, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasiliy, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to the KTUU channel, Palin is in the Matanuska-Susitno detention facility under a $500 bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "precisely innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network said.
Palin is accused of three Class A offences, for which he faces imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with committing a class B crime, which is punishable by imprisonment for a day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Mr Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell them about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the exact moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York terror attack.
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that hasn’t been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, in October allegedly took advantage of the rented truck of the company "Home Depot" to ride on the bicycle path along the West side of the highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify the death sentence, according to the notice of intent to achieve the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" shot down eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court's materials, for both offenses, a death penalty is possible.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigative jury stunned Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in support of the racket; this is a point commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime and indictment cases.
According to prosecutors, the attack required “careful and deliberate planning”, and describing the crimes committed by Saipa, used such phrases as “disgusting, cruel and depraved”.
"Sifula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and caused losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lora Decodt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Feruch, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Hernando Mendoza.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last criminal case involving the death penalty was opened in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in New York in a federal case was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple punished after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A couple of Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he said he was pleased with his performance.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack by viewing a video of the Islamic State on his phone.
He also asked for permission to display the Islamic State flag in the hospital palace, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "unconditionally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty, rather than a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” Paton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at a Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
Former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel uncomfortable” by Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs offered her candidacy for talks with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have already “gone out” had Mr Farage held the post of Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faced in trying to reconcile her disparate supporters was further exacerbated when the Tories, who are in favour of keeping EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the compromise Checker Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and opponents of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the “disorder”.
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Salihale "Leave Means Leave" that he wanted to "drop the checker off the board".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made equal and that the obligations for negotiations with Brussels should be imposed.
“If he had been responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellington added: "I am for Brexit, but we need to move away from the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely out of line.”
A supporter of Brexit and a member of the Torah, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists said: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Checker Plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and the activists who actually take to the streets and elect us.
Please step away from the plan and start listening.”
In a scathing address to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain in office when they deliver on their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians need to be made to "feel uncomfortable" if they are going to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – people and politicians,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them: ‘This will not get out of your hands.’”
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make those of our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they faced over the party program at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have a ready-to-use IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she "will pay close attention to the process of running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a general assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to run for re-election, pitted against Republican Jeff Dil, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, this was the 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general assembly, which was held on Saturday in Halliock.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and for that, a woman should be in charge.”
The arrest took place after the death of basketball player Sims from the team of the University of Louisiana
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of UCL basketball player Wade Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the person who appeared on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead Friday morning near the South University campus.
“Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head that killed him,” Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) tall junior athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season, 10 of which were on the court from the start, averaged 17.4 minutes on the court, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the title of world champion after the intra-team agreement won the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton at the qualifying race on Saturday, it has become clear that the decrees inside the Mercedes team will play a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good spot on the foal and almost left Hamilton at the mercy of fate while he defended his place in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton to fend off at the end of the general mass of riders, it was this maneuver that was supposed to be decisive.
The Mercedes driver went to the pit stop for a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking to keep after a double manoeuvre.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led most of the race while holding the tires because he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen and finish fourth.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th lap, but could not increase the speed on the remaining eight laps, so R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walter has been performing fantastically all weekend and has expressed himself as a true gentleman if I'm allowed to say so.
“The team did an outstanding job to take first and second place,” Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted she was not the source of the leak of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be “savage, disgusting and untrue.”
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Hold on a minute.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and he fled in early September – but Feinstein denied that the escape had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked for the story to remain confidential and I granted her request.”
But her denial probably didn’t sit well with the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you, it was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are full of determination to return their power to any state.
You see the meanness, the filth, and they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to step over to gain power and control,” the president said.

Air traffic controller dies, rescuing hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia died heroically, ensuring the successful take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many went missing after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami.
Strong underground tremors are still ongoing, and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were fleeing, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower, which was swinging wildly at the airport of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
It remained in place until the aircraft 6321 company "Batik Air", which was at that time on the runway, did not break off from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, according to the representative of <0xC2><0xAB>Air Navigation Indonesia» Johannes Sirait, the decision of the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was supposed to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to the Pole.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the disaster risk reduction agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Bouton is restricted.
Agency spokesman Soutopa Purva Nugroha said: "It is possible that the number of victims will still increase, as many bodies still have not been able to dig out from under the rubble."
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Polo, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
There's no clean water.
There are shops everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who have survived, but we don’t know what awaits them here.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Jok Widoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?” – reports “CNN”.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: according to "Air Niugini" one person went missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight, which made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the plane, which was sinking, and now claims to be missing one passenger.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday it could not provide a report on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report the details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after landing the plane on the water while attempting to land at Chuvak Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
According to some reports, the plane was missing from the runway.
According to the American passenger Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
According to him, he and others were able to get through the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, as well as that he had received a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who repaired near the marina also helped in the rescue, using a inflatable boat to transport people to the shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst restores the course of events on the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the submission of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his past statements.
If it was reported that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth about the fact that Sanford was in the van that night, he stated that he was “lying because my van was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was Tellis's claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after her death, Chambers Tellis deleted her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Haley said.
The two sides are due to begin their arguments on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is the famous hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre, filling their music with positive installations.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip-hop has drifted away from its origins: political statements and ostracized issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the famous hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have regained popularity in the UK with bands such as The Fugees and Common.
There's another black?!
Babysitter from New York sues a married couple for "racist" message after dismissal
A nanny from New York sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an accidentally sent message from her mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the loan to "extortion".
In 2016, Lindsay Plaska-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent a message to Ms. Morris.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing the mistake, "felt awkward" Plaska-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, did a bad job, and that she was waiting for her Filipino.
Ms. Morris paid for the day's work and was sent home on Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple and wants to get compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months with accommodation.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” she told Post on Friday.
The couple denied accusations of racism, arguing that Maurice's dismissal was a wise decision, given that they couldn't trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something that should not have been said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said “Post” husband, Joel Plaska.
“Would you trust your children with whom you dealt rudely, even by accident?
Your baby?
What is it?’
Plaska equates the lawsuit to “extortion” and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
"And you're going to chase a man in such a position?
It’s pretty tough,” added a specialist in investment banking.
Although the legal proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, subjecting them to harsh criticism of their behavior and logic.
Publishers in Paddington feared that readers wouldn't be swayed by a talking bear, according to a new leaf.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the one who reads it for the first time before it is published.
This is a great book to read, and one that is well-known for its excellent storytelling.”
She said her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a children's book about a small toy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, speaking of Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family".
“He was a pretty quiet man, and not at all boastful,” she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a father's honor for a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, although in fact it is not your merit.
I think that's how he saw his success.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave his due to Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors fought for her life in vain.
“Over regularly phoned to tell her that things were really bad, that she couldn’t take it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I called Nad to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tasha, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who gave her the medicine to beat her heart slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end of it.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was going on.
I couldn't stop crying or crying because there were so many people around me.
I should have stayed.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – and they did not know what she had to go through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I bowed my head and there were tears all over my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was in the air that I felt Ned's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are sad to hang cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones, who committed suicide, do everything so that other people do not take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out cards with warm words and phone numbers that people can use to get help on a bridge in Wales.
Tyler's son, Davis Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I do,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydna, said her son was a talented chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said his smile would light up any room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found the body of his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly concerned that there may be unpleasant consequences."
Ms. Davis created the cards, “so that people would know that there are people in the world that you can reach out to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t stay in silence – you need to talk.”
Ms. Hasfris, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that the weather had changed.
On the feast day he was very distressed: when the children opened the presents, he did not even look at them.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to live with it: “A huge hole appeared in the family.
It's just killing us.
But we have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation.
“I thought we could have what he wants – limited in time and scope of the investigation – we can get a little bit of unification,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was “falling apart” because it was actually caught in a traffic jam.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their inadequacies are sometimes explained.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6th – if Republicans are expected to suffer defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect the candidate they need to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem of equality of votes and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen under Kim's leadership.
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Boe-sung, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reasons were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher prices set by smugglers for the shipment.
Pyongyang has not commented on this.
Most of the refugees from the North are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily guarded.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to a common timetable for work aimed at fully ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yang Ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions, we are not going to disarm first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Breta Kavanaugh an “expert”, she says he should not work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh a “historian” and said that by his temperament he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t shake the thought that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called an ‘historian,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally refuted allegations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when his family and high school classes were being discussed.
He also explicitly accused Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and organized murder of a person” organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's speech showed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he had made it clear that he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected and if Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this – if he’s not telling the truth in Congress or in the FBI, then he’s not only not supposed to be working in the Supreme Court, he’s not supposed to be in the court where he’s working right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in Roe v. Wade because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearing in Kavanaugh's office, he did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect us to say ‘how wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
A woman should know that.
It's a justified blame speech, months and years of anger just overflowing, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it’s that bad.”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and who said that if she got angry, she cried, but worked out the technique of behavior. When she got angry and began to cry, she said to her interlocutor: “Perhaps you think that I am sad, because I am crying.
But I'm angry."
I just continued the conversation.
I thought that was cool.”
Tears are allowed in part as a way out of the amount, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, in which I once cried with inexpressible anger, was then grabbed by the collar by an elderly woman – a reserved boss who always scared me a little – and dragged me to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let yourself be seen in tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they brought you here."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was caught cheating on a yacht called the Monkey Business and walked out of the presidential race, the very angry Mrs. Schroeder thought that she herself could participate in the presidential campaign.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” laughing she told me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates, and I didn’t need them.
Someone called this situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the company had been going for quite a long time, it lacked funds, so it said it would not participate in the election unless it raised $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her fans, who donated $ 1,000 to men, gave her only $ 250.
“Do you think I’m going to go to jail?” he thought.
When she made the statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system, which made it so difficult to get money and aimed at voters, not at candidates, and anger at sexism – that she caught her breath.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the press reaction to her condition.
“You might have thought that my corporate sponsor is the paper napkin manufacturer Kleenex.
I was wondering what they were going to write on my headstone.
“She was crying?”
Why a trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between China and the United States were deafening, and as the war is far from over, in the longer term misunderstandings between the countries may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, when new tariffs affected goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing has responded in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has promised the United States a symmetric response, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to catch the eye.
To force Washington to retreat, it is necessary to deepen the demand, but the public bow to the United States is almost unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the US trade war in the long term can support China, reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a process of sharp economic decline is far more dangerous than observers previously thought,” said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia at the New York-based New York Security Research and Analysis Center.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to return to normal life.
We now have all the conditions for the return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'allem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.

“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I could help,” said Excited Garcia after winning the European team.
He passed the baton to his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in 2&1 singles matches.
“I’m very proud to have won against Tiger Woods, a man I’ve followed since I was a kid,” said Ram, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his queens in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.

The U.S. team fought back with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tnie Finn, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning, we showed Europe what we can do.
We have fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Golf Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We're screwed."
