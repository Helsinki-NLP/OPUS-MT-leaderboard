Welsh members of parliament are concerned about “similarity with Mapetovci”
Some Members of Parliament (AM) have been sidelined by a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This happened because it is planned to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all political persuasions are concerned that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that the abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means wacky, and pwp means feces.
A member of the parliament from the political party "Plaid" said that the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A Welsh member of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to changing its name, but noted that MWP is pronounced similar to Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on the generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission opted for the option of Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the broadest support in public consultations.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could give a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the Assembly and the plan of the system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate on the said law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the country's new name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring northern state represents its territorial possession and has persistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin have died down, and the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I talked to say that there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
“There is no one else today.”
The lack of coffee is understandable.
“People today associate in a different way,” he says.
“Cafés no longer play the role of living quarters from neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
As for churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be back to square one.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who won’t help the remaining sanctuaries from the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these residential buildings will become their members.”
Both churches built communities made up of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that performed worship nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The fire of 1939 caused great damage to the building, but since the parishioners of Father Johnson decided to restore it, they ordered an organ.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the organ “the organ of the poor.”
An expert who played the organ in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger organ in Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriwether stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by secular church leaders and others by an episcopal diocese.
The parish administration – the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders – wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs “to the parish administration, even though the parish administration was not involved in the hiring of the architects and entrepreneurs employed by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old during lobster hunt in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he scuba-dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon’s Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends on Saturday for about half an hour when he heard the boy’s calls for help, and then he and the group rowed to him to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of catching a lobster, but then “he realized he was yelling ‘She bit me!
She bit me.”
Members of the assembly of all political persuasions are concerned that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
“I called out to everyone to come out of the water: ‘The shark is in the water!’” he said.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is not known what type of shark attacked him.
Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a press release that a few weeks earlier, the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it had been determined not to belong to the dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in the city of Encinitas.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with department stores in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK, with that figure rising as sales in the fashion and home appliance markets fall, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will open in more stores next year if they prove to be successful.
Investing in beauty products comes as supermarkets are finding ways to use up space on shelves after lawsuits over televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s has announced that it will double its cosmetic product offering to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching the Boutique makeup range to make most products vegan-friendly – which is what demand is on the rise when it comes to younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test outlets in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opens in Sely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and switching to the daily purchase of small amounts of food at local stores means that supermarkets need to make an extra effort to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coop, chief executive of Sainsbury’s retail chain, said the department’s outlet will increasingly resemble self-service as the supermarket chain tries to hit back at high-rebate outlets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which it says has boosted food sales and procurement profitability.
The previous attempt of this supermarket to modernize the departments for cosmetic and pharmaceutical products ended infamously.
Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after winning a share of the pharmaceutical store revenue share in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold the 281-store pharmaceutical company to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetic departments to provide a better environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for the way we shop.”
Peter Jones 'mad' after Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of "Dragons Den," went "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a $11 million business with his personal brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
The couple's company collaborated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old announced her departure this morning via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Peter Jones, the star of "Dragons" Den, by pulling out of a lucrative deal with their brand at the last minute to focus on her own new lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones was “angry” when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new offers worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he no longer had enough time to commit to their brand of homeware and accessories.
The company worked with actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was forecast to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced via Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his cottages.
According to the source: “Holly put the Truly brand at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term plan from which she would earn in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
The warehouse at Marlowe's headquarters is packed with ready-to-sell merchandise."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home equipment, as well as possible further postponements of the launch date.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Cap, and in March they were joined by Jones, 52, as the company's director.
These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production house.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After the harsh words, “sympathies have appeared”
He has come under fire in the media for comments that some say are “not worthy of a president” and for his positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why Is President Trump Retreating So Much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
"We're not retreating from anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “adequate reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States is not lifting sanctions that put continued pressure on it.
Trump made a much more optimistic point in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He noted that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – the missile tests have been completed, the hostages have been released and the remaining US soldiers have returned home.
He defended this unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so we are facing some difficulties,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet known if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Given the constant earthquakes that are shaking Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shores.
The loss of life was probably also contributed to the apparent lack of response to the tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though the warning was in effect.
Travel between the numerous Indonesian islands is otherwise a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed on Lombok Island to assist earthquake victims on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia’s aging infrastructure and saving money for roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding has hit Mr. Yoko's administration, and he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure that creates long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cruel weapons.
Daniel Starridge, a Liverpool player, manages to score an even point against Chelsea
Daniel Stirridge saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starridge received a pass from Gerdan Shaqiri at 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1–0.
First he moved the ball to the left side, then kicked it to the furthest part of the net.
The ball went high above the goal in the direction of the right upper corner of the net.
She eventually flew over goaltender Kep Aryzabalaga who jumped to catch her and burst into the net.
I was just trying to put myself up and set myself up for the shot, and players like Shaqiri always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible,” he told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I touched one ball and just kicked it, without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1–0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Azar's goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker returned the ball to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> with a fifth, then turned in the middle of the field and ran to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a few short blows in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a brilliant center shot, leading Azara to the goal.
Hazard overtook the defense and directed the final shot with his left foot into the furthest part of the net alongside Alison Becker, a Liverpool player.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meet with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to the disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
Numerous reports of people trapped in the rubble of buildings hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, has been buried by the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Berkenhead, Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Muse on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police called people in the area who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would invite anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Berkenhead and was found on the property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently notifying the victim's next of kin.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Muzey, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him everyone was banned from entering and leaving the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told they would be allowed to return in a few hours.
It was reported that a police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
On the spot appeared a woman in tears.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were in a cordon with another van in front.
Several police officers stood in a cordon watching the apartment blocks.
Anyone with any information is invited to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and provide a record of 247 as of September 30.
A statue of Cromwell in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate about the monuments because of the quarrel about the "falsification of history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-style destruction of many of the English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was an unavoidable target in the current debate over the removal of the statue.
Cromwell neither issued an order nor carried out iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the deed of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Turnicroft bears witness to 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure who, according to many, still deserves to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, from the monarchy.
The reliability of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this mid-17th-century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell as an individual is a recognizable figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and kept from oblivion."
Pig-murderer caused fatal injuries to a Chinese peasant
According to local media reports, a peasant was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his last name “Juan”, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
The owner of the pig farm is preparing to inject injections to pigs in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly came with a relative from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning and noticed that the door of the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the piggy who had blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had caused fatal injuries to a farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said a relative named Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows that Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40am to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so as not to attack anyone again, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Juan’s family and the market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, there have already been recorded cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting critical injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig kept a Welsh peasant pinned to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a trigger.
“They’re just playing.
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread rainstorms to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain showers to the north of Maxick and the southwest of the United States that will lead to flooding.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 137 km/h on Saturday morning at 5 a.m. and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards, toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push high tropical moisture northward, toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low-pressure field approaching will lead to widespread showers in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential floods, the distribution of debris with water and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will occasionally cause precipitation of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Torrential floods are possible with a sharp deterioration in conditions due to the unbridled nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely reckless to walk into the desert while being threatened by tropical rains.
Due to heavy precipitation, canyons can turn into frantic rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to stormy winds and dust in the air.
A low-pressure field approaching will bring local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation amounts of over 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause less water damage and slippery pavements.
It will be the first rain in the region for their rainy season.
Mesthymic tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday evening and Tuesday rainfall will cover the wider area.
The showers will extend into the southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large fluctuations in temperature across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, while in tropical areas it will remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature over small distances.
A great example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne in Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees.
The long-lasting summer heat will grow and spread again in the next few days.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected with temperatures of 27 degrees Celsius across much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that allegedly took place in the 1980s, on six television channels on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters suspending the regular programming scheme for Friday due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunken Kavanaugh was groping her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a touching testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
That was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
She calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that displayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of viewers in offices.
By comparison, that number of viewers can rival the audience following a playoff football game or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, with hosts of "Opinion" strongly supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, recorded the highest viewership of any network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the drama that unfolded on Friday.
After a statement from the moderate Republican's office that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters shouting at him on Friday morning as he was trying to take the elevator to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his gaze lowered as they insulted him, which CNN broadcast live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and such women are powerless.’”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations broadcast the events live hours later when the Justice Committee was due to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate.
However, Flake said he only agreed to it on the condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee next week, which was persistently demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flaika was partly convinced by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and several other senators after him, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had weight because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ in Brexit case
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the UK’s future and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview with her on the front page of a newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers Brexit plan, calling the proposal for a single customs zone for Britain and the EU “completely meaningless”.
The murder of Wade Simms: the police arrested the suspect Dajtheon Simpson for the death of a player of the University of Louisiana
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old University of Louisiana basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to the WAFB channel, which is connected to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally wounding Wade with a pistol shot.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The parish pathologist’s office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday that cited a bullet wound through the head to the neck as the cause of death.
The department attributes credit for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest to the Louisiana State Police Operations Unit for apprehending fugitives, the state crime lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents.
The director of the University of Louisiana's athletics department, Joe Aleva, thanked local law enforcement for "advocacy and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-meter-tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something that worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash to Mexico City
The ash that ejects the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
This center has recorded more mild seismological activity.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City municipalities, such as Hocimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence supporters clashed with riot police, while thousands joined counter-demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of a Catalan vote to secede that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, restrained by riot police, shot them with eggs and threw paint in the dust, and dark clouds of dust formed in the streets, which are usually littered with tourists.
Later in the day, there was also a brawl that police officers restrained with pincers.
The pro-independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiveness” for several hours in the face of Unionist Protestants shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people received help due to minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions have not waned in the region, which is committed to independence, even a year after a referendum held on October 1 that separatist Catalans hailed as illegal, even though Madrid has declared it illegal.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although the turnout was low as the anti-secession crowd boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police forces.
Demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
My parents were crying with happiness that they could vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation,” he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to carry on in the same spirit this year as many of their best-known leaders have been in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting independence trials for their role in the referendum.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used a phone to film a protest in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is all tense," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial in prison since the end of last year, has announced that he will run in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Emphasizing the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men were arrested after knocking on the car in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly driving their car into a house in Londonerry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30pm UK summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blumings said the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the house.
Menge's goal brings Livingstone a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga secures first goal win for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers by forcing Steven Gerard to concede only a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Manga's goal brought changes as Gary Holt's team tied Hibernian in second place.
Gerard’s team is left without a win in the Premier League this season, and next week he meets with the leaders on the Harts table, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers are coming to visit Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the unbeaten streak in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenya Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chance against uninspired guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal he scored, as he was making trouble for Rangers at all levels with an offensive game.
Scott Robinson broke through, but carried the ball in front of the goal, only to have Alan Lithgow kick it past the net after he slid in to receive a head-butt from Craig Halket in front of the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could give the away team a hard time with the actions they took.
That’s how they scored the key goal.
Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston opened the match after performing a free kick by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to hire Menga to pass the ball to a mid-sixer goal.
In the previous part of the game, Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
The same style continued in the second half, although Kelly had to defend one shot from Alfred Morelos.
Alan McGregor, the Rangers' goaltender, rebuffed Scott Pitman's attack and Lithgow shot past the goal in another live-action game against Livingston.
Livingston defended several center shots, and two penalty shootouts were also denied – following Halket’s objection to replacing Glen Middleton and one for hand-playing.
The Phenomenal Game of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Maccaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
All players, without exception, were outstanding and again exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Since returning to the front lines, they have hardly changed the style of the game and the people, but it is necessary to pay great tribute to Holt for the way he brought vivacity to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halket was unsurpassed in leading a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warhol on high alert the entire time.
The Rangers, however, were not impressed.
As good as he once was under Gerard, he fell well below that level.
They couldn’t score – they only broke through the host’s defense once – and that’s a kind of alarm bell for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met with a mixed reception in the Colony
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This city is home to the largest part of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque citing security concerns, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – were also heard denouncing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The conflicting protests reflect a division of opinion about a visitor whom some Turks in Germany are casting as a hero, while others accuse him of being an autocrat.
Accident on the road in Depford: the cyclist died in a collision with a car
In a collision with a car in London, a cyclist was killed.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics showed him help, but the man died on the spot.
A few months before this collision, another cyclist was killed in Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the collision that happened on Saturday, which the driver hit and fled.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
The roads are closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison said.
The riots that are still ongoing took place at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 09:30 UK summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists was brought in to overcome the unrest that was reduced to one wing and in which eight prisoners participated.
Police were called in to help with minor injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison officers have been brought in for an ongoing incident at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of staff received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and our position is clear that those responsible will be reported to the police, which is why they could be held behind bars for a longer time."
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was undergoing hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the interventionist police were called to prison for serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential flooding (which can come in handy in drought-affected areas)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest, carrying with it the risks of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will come directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit the region 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm, with amounts as high as 15 cm in isolated places, such as Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5–5 cm, with possible total amounts in isolated places of up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential rain flooding that Rosa will bring can be a blessing since the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious cause for concern, rain in some parts will be welcome as there is currently a drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought watchdog, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit at the very least by an extreme drought, a Category 2 drought,” weather.com reports.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still had a hurricane strength with maximum winds of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it has lost strength.
That is why it is expected that the landslides in Mexico will occur when the storm reaches the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible, which carries a significant risk of flooding.
“A total rainfall of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora state, with as much as 10 cm possible,” reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move upward through Arizona, and arrive late Tuesday night in southern Utah.
“The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is a very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the American desert in the southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that this rain will lead to torrential floods of life-threatening and the distribution of fracking water in deserts and landslides on hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4am UK summer time.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the town of Radstock, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have asked anyone who may have footage of the event on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the malice and anger” of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and shameful tactics,” Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh, in a vigorous and emotional testimony before Congress on Thursday, denied claims by Christine Blaise Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At this hearing, Ford also testified about his claims.
The president said Saturday that “the American people saw all the genius, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-rate background in public service,” he told a rally of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
Even though I’m not running personally, I’m actually running,” he said.
“We’re fighting for great candidates.”
Trump concluded that the Democrats are on a mission of “resisting and disrupting.”
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a statement from senior GOP aide to CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have left hundreds dead, and that number is still rising.
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by giant waves that hit beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach festival when six-meter-high waves hit the coast at dawn, taking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was accompanied by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach instead of fleeing immediately and therefore became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said in a statement.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everyone on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges distorted and demolished, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake struck the coastal city again on Saturday.
In an area where 2.4 million people live, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy of the devastating earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical features of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a higher tsunami strength,” he said.
Nugroho said the damage was "massive" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said more losses and damage along the coast were possible 300km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communications “were completely cut off and there was no information” from Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
The agency received criticism from various sides on Saturday that it did not issue a notice that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at a time when a warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared via social media, a man on the top floor of the building is heard screaming from a spotted vein, warning people on the street of a approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still needed food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for assistance arriving and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
The staff of the humanitarian organization World Vision arrived safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where the employees are hiding in shelters made of waterproof cloth placed in the courtyard of the office and on the way to the city they were greeted by the scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
Even as relief groups began taking the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the inflow of overseas funds, supplies and people is only possible if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be characterized as a province-level disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but for now there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that hit him on Friday, friends and family of the missing still cherished the hope that their loved ones would somehow miraculously escape the sad fates of the victims of natural disasters.
The little boy was taken out of the sewers on Saturday.
Rescuers on Sunday freed a woman from the rubble that had been trapped next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were attending a beach festival.
However, his messages bore only one gray label, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
The thieves took away $26,750 during the filling of an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to inject more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “ran behind the back of an employee at Brink’s” and stole a bag of money to be put in an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is encouraged to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to “Ye.”
In a tweet on Saturday, he wrote: "It will once be known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to announce a new album, Yandhi.
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am all of us, that’s us.
From the name Kanya, which means ‘the only one’, I have moved on to just ‘Ye’ (you) – which is the personification of all that is good, bad and unclear in us.
This album is essentially a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, who is known by nicknames Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, this year pointed out that he would like to be called "Love" and "Brother Love".
West's former associate, Jay-Z, used the nickname with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-designate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the country’s bloody revenge against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were based in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving financial aid each month to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and the inability to get an education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area, said investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. foreign governments announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“For starters, it would be good to double the AI research budget, as all other countries are so late for the U.S., and we are aiming for new advances in this domain,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a publishing house, works as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later was director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee paid tribute to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the U.S. Defense Department’s “Robot Challenge” agency responsible for developing new technologies (DARPA) and asked when the next one would take place, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Li said.
“It’s not the academic leaders who go to China, it’s the big corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring prominent minds from universities to work on developing artificial intelligence.
Lee points out that changes in immigration policies could help the U.S. strengthen its pursuit of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are allocating money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from the sector and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a select artificial intelligence committee.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “New Generation Artificial Intelligence.”
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that required the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked their EU and NATO membership bids.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern state represents its own territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would threaten the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, majority-Slavic population.
President Djordje Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot reads: “Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would obey the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went out to vote for my children because we belong in Europe," said Djose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ka voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country that should open the path of this country to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and sets up chairs in front of the tents set up by opponents of the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upright heads, not through the service entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result "for" would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will turn out in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma, concluded that 57 percent of voters would turn out for the referendum.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
In order for a referendum to be successful, half of the registered voters plus one are required to vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since its seizure of power in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defences on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, in a 2–0 win for Manchester City.
It seemed too easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field from where the attack began.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players, then mowed them all down in the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He outplayed one defensive player, and overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English winger immediately returned the ball to Ag<0xC3><0xBC>era, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-handed kick to the right of the net.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55, 60 minutes.
That's the way it was.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
However, the initial advantage of the Skyscrapers in meeting the Premier League was brought by Sterling.
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's territory in that action.
He made a wonderful addition to Leroy Sein on the left.
Sein had several contacts with the ball before hiring Sterling on a second tripod.
The Skyscraper's attacker put the ball into the net, then immediately slipped out of the field.
Manchester City meet with Hoffenheim on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55 p.m. in a Champions League group match at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a match against Rocky without competitive importance for the Nationals
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on another game.
However, competitively minded Sherzer hopes to take a position Sunday against Colorado Rocky, but only if the Rockys, who have one game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the playoff game.
The Rokias secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5–2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to win their first division title.
“Although we can’t win anything, at least we can go out on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably be at the highest level against any point I would have played this year.
Why shouldn’t I participate in such a contest?”
Nationals hasn’t announced a starter for the week yet, but they’re reportedly considering letting Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzer, who would have been 34th time to open the game, held a training session on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he normally rests.
Washington's right-handed player leads 18–7 this season with an average of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, during a speech on the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved will be at stake in November.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the biggest – even though I’m not running in person, I’m actually running and that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
“Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
They are determined to regain power by not choosing means, seeing meanness, dirty games.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of “resisting and disrupting.”
"You could have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, mean, vile and insincere."
He mentioned Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for him—that was very bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
I am just the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome – just because we have expressed our opinions.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan River, has gone through the same thing because she is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – the irony is that these are similar topics on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice for a meeting of the Labour Party in East Nottingham said on Friday that “we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive.”
Of the eight years I have been a Labour Member of Parliament, Friday night General Committee meetings have generally been just that.
Unfortunately, meetings in this spirit are rarely held today, and the promise of a “more noble, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if ever there were such aspirations.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate differences of opinion, and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared similar political views began to expect me to change them from the ground up and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – be it on national security or the EU single market.
Every public address I make – no matter what I say – is accompanied by a tirade of abuse on social networks calling for the annulment of my choice, condemning the policy of the center, saying that I have no place in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one with this experience.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day without ever being distracted by it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we no longer accept different views and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of the election, the party becomes more and more crowded.
In the past two years, I have often been advised, urging me to put my head down, to keep my opinions to myself, and then I would “be fit.”
But it goes against my political goals.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school bench, caused by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, which allowed my school classroom to literally collapse, I have striven to provide better public services to those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my political affiliation, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and topics on which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just like to say that, at a time when our country is rushing towards Brexit that will endanger households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to the Momentum organisation in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of nullification of my choice nor political scheming will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ir 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ir climbs to the top
Two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ire took a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
They are now at the top of the table, as the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the home team took the lead thanks to superior defense, as well as a greater number of used chances and coach Peter Murci had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in previous games and we haven’t lost yet, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “All the praise for Ira, they took their chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, turned by Frasier Klimo, brought Ira an advantage, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Huey, taken by the Warriors out of the water, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott grabbed the unconverted e.
Klimo criminally increased Ira's lead, before, at halftime, scoring and turning a solo essay to give Ira a 17–5 break.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, turned by Bagot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a prolonged standstill due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was brought on a stretcher, and Ire further increased the lead with an essay by Stafford McDowell, who was turned by Klimo.
Then Ira's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player more by Bruce Colvin failing to convert the essay, after a short burst of pressure.
However, the foreign host returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for wrestling with Klim without a ball, from the penalty line, McPherson entered a touchdown behind the Ira Mall in the attack.
Klimo converted the essay, which he did again almost immediately below, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth essay of the home page.
The star of “Still Game” is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the “Still Game” series, Ford Kiernan, is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed as the director of a company that holds licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he co-wrote and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphile.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the series and Kiernan appears to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia denied access to the sea in hopes that the court will again allow it access to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings, the flag of the color of the ocean is fluttering.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: “We have a full right to the sea.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has been denied access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coast in the bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it the longing for another voyage to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia’s current development of the situation goes hand in hand, it is governed by a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects an outcome in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate the ceding of a sovereign outlet to the Bolivian sea after decades of talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who is expected to face a controversial re-election battle next year – Monday’s verdict also carries many risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that little would change even if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has the case of Bolivia not progressed, but the past four years may have put it behind us.
“The issue of access to the sea has been seized on by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric killed off any fondness for Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Welce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will get “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who remains one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political foothold.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“This verdict is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it doesn’t trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never end their nuclear weapons program if they don’t trust Washington.
Ri delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore in the talks of the conflicting leaders.
His comments come as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled diplomatic nuclear arms talks more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it’s just a pipe dream that continued sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness in renouncing its nuclear arsenal, which his country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows showcase the latest lines of bulky head covering accessories you’ll soon see in the nearby main street
If you want to enrich the hat collection with bulkier models or completely block the sun, the search is over.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of freaky huge headwear accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that eclipsed everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats set Instagram on fire this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the catwalk.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was the over-emphasized beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that swallowed the head of the model with its size.
Other bulky additions include watermelons decorated with jewelry, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment complete with a snorkel and mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cornet.
And if you follow the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details – you’re in luck.
Those who follow the trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn along nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the emergence of the popular straw hat "La Bomba" with a two-meter-wide rim that has walked many celebrities - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label on this impractical hat, which flooded social networks, stood behind another great creation that was depicted on the runway – straw beach bags almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit who wore it.
At the Paris Fashion Week 2019 Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacques de La Riviera, the most prominent was the orange-coloured raffia bag, trimmed with raffia and with a white leather handle at the top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in the main street next summer – since the designer has made such a boom, it would be hard to ignore such a demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is crucial for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding test scores, further strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career, and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject chosen by students in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, they’ll get into your head.
If you speak his native language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's tests, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade from Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent of those who learn Spanish also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of the reasons cited by employers as the main problems in filling vacancies were attributed to ignorance of the language.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the multiple potential business opportunities that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess a skill like this for a lifetime.
The possibility of direct communication with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks more languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 per cent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, 15 per cent.
That is why it is now important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
In every school in Scotland, different languages will be taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered to be most important for the United Kingdom in advance in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be more languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are proficient in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It cannot be denied that in today’s global business environment, languages are still crucial for the country’s future, so they must have their place in education as well.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered the "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and exceptional achievement.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
It’s almost the end of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his exact minute has yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would likely have a limited minute.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies this evening as part of his election campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for next week, with stays in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a delayed vote to confirm his candidate to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia below online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected Senate confirmation vote delayed by a week until the FBI completes its investigation.
However, this series of rallies is held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the run-up to the November election.
As part of President Trump’s campaign, the five rallies that will be held next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“The importance of controlling Congress is so great for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia, the state where he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent points, will be his second in a month on Saturday.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to raise him in polls," Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows determination to fight to stay in the game in the face of singles matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon doubles tournament may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
Although the variability of the momentum is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, on whose side would you say it's a moment?
“They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so we can say the momentum is on our side,” Spite said.
Europe is, of course, ahead of us with four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Although the Americans, according to Spit, get a little wind in their backs and have a lot on their side, especially the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
The Spit was murderous from the first to the last blow and gave everyone a homework assignment.
The shouts of delight grew louder throughout his round, and he eventually played a key final shot and got a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas trailed by two after two.
His final shot, which gave them a 15-hole match, was met with a similar scream, which reflects the belief that the American team is not out.
“Essentially, you just have to give it your best shot and take care of your own match,” said Spit.
That’s all these players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are no doubt Ryder Cup storytellers.
An unusual and at the same time charming European couple won all four matches and played without error.
Molywood was the only couple not to have been hit by the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the other half of Friday morning.
The game they’ve shown so far and the way they’re exchanging energy with a noisy crowd cemented them as top favourites on Sunday and there’s no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory at sunset over the pitches of Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European celebration.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole they never even managed to get out of.
Although, on Sundays, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
The four-ball game and the couples’ tournament are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between couples, the tips they give and don’t give, and the way strategy can instantly change.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great lead ahead of the final day, but this session of the doubles tournament also showed that the US team has a desire for a fight that some doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe lead with 10-6 ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament, it achieved a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took the lead with two wins over the indisposed Tiger Woods, increasing the previous result on the pitches of Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who struggled to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in the four-ball morning game and won the series 3–1.
The United States put up more resistance in the doubles tournament, winning two matches, but were unable to reduce the backlog.
Jim Furik's side must score eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, nicknamed "Molywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After running over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then blended in brilliantly and beat out pumped Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschamps with an even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who made his way through two matches on Saturday, flashed for moments, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball game and in a doubles tournament and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the doubles tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepke – the first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not go as planned on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
Three-time Majors tournament winner Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They struggled to secure a 2–1 win over John Ram and Jan Pulter in the four-ball game, but later returned to beat Pulter and Rory McElroy 4–3 in the doubles tournament after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back after a four-point gap before a singles match, although the defending champion Furik's side is a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after already two days in second place, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday would be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says 'no talk' of unilateral disarmament unless there is trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures in the past year to demonstrate good will” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, there is no appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for gradual steps, his statement was significant because it did not remove unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also ignored calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States is not giving up on ‘denuclearization first and foremost’ and is increasing the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“What they think sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the dreams of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If we were to negotiate this denuclearization issue with South Korea rather than with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock.”
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s missiles at US soil was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said much more needed to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday he had not set a time frame for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strictly and unrelentingly enforced until there is complete, final, verifiable denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, and that North Korea would condemn him after only a few hours for making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile test site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him the “appropriate measures” required by the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore were steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to get more sleep in an effort to root out the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night long with the help of caffeine.”
One academic noted that students at the number one university in the world are often ignorant about basic self-care.
Charles Chysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea for this course came to him after a speech he held about the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
One girl eventually came up to me and said, “Why am I only hearing this now, in my senior year of college?”
She said no one had ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is being held for the first time this year, students are introduced to the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was noticed that students during the week suffer from a serious lack of sleep.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm room and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second part, participants hear how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know that — just as everyone has a right to know what the health consequences of smoking cigarettes are.”
A culture of pride in “sleepless nights” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students has led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and of good quality, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep the brain goes into starvation mode, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheysler design the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course has opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance on a campus-wide level.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask all graduate students to undergo a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chysler recommended that students think about setting alarms in time for sleep and wakefulness and take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerard's team with a goal
Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga shot down Steven Gerrard's team in a 1–0 loss to Livingston.
The team at Ibrox Stadium tried to take their first away win after a 4–1 triumph in St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second loss on Gerard as manager in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unreachable Ladbrokes Premier League leaders.
Menga shot seven minutes before the half-time, and the uninspired Rangers line-up never came close to equalizing.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third behind Hibernian just because of the goal difference.
Rangers may face additional problems after line judge Kalum Spence had to seek help for a head wound after being hit on the side by an object.
Gerard made eight innings in the team that outstripped Ire and advanced to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took Hartsham’s point last week and would be thrilled with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
There was little left to score just two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pitman into empty space with the first pass on Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfield player missed a great chance and shot past the goal.
Kegan Jacobs then took a deep free kick to find Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow shot next to the goal with another easel.
Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last line gave more hope than faith in themselves.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have gotten a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawles collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly easily defended Lasana Coulibaly's header and tamed the shot that sent Ovie Eyaria.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the right balance of power during the game, no one can dispute that he was deserved if for no other reason, then for the effort.
Rangers again could not cope with Jacobs's deep-played action.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher slipped the ball to Slot Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately produced a result when the winger hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lead the guests to play just as it suited them, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halket.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held on well and defended the attack of Jacobs, and then Litgow from the corner of his head sent the ball past the goal.
Glen Middleton, the Rangers' replacement, was looking for another penalty at the end of the game when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not respond again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the mainstays of science, the Geiger counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Bells, which starred seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What’s that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Look, you can really hear it!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to Recognize and Kill Depraved Cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common in many types of cancer and then re-inject it.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer receded for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has been well proven in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the fierce attacks in defense of Trump, wearing a cap labeled MAGA, after a guest appearance on the SNL show.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was scouted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for some political office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, "Ghost Town," with a cap bearing the slogan "Make America Great," he delivered a scathing anti-Democrat speech and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I’ve talked to white people who would say to me, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show aired a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star derided Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blaze Ford's claims of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted a recording of West's violent speech on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make fun of Vesta with this announcement.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat."
They threatened me!
And then they say I sank," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The news continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "they're going to put on Superman's cloak because that means you can't order me around. Do you want a better world?
Spread the love.”
The audience scoffed at his remarks at least twice, and it seemed as if the members of the SNL cast were uncomfortable, Variety reported, with one of the audience saying to the magazine: "The whole study has been plagued."
Last-minute news replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of the song "I Love It", disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
The news received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candice Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOT THOUGHT IN FRIENDS."
However, TV show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "her own and that's absolutely beautiful".
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe embraces and loudly extols an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "now going to be known as Kanye West".
He’s not the first artist to change his name – before him did Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.

The Public Prosecutor’s Office will consider the charges.
'Game of Thrones' star Keith Harrington condemns macho culture
Keith Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones, which depicts a medieval fantasy full of violence.
However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that due to such roles on the screen, young men often feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith expressed his view that “something has gone wrong” and addressed the question of how to deal with the problem of macho culture in the #JaIsto era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m pretty bothered by the question right now – what did we do wrong with representing masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of the destructive macho culture due to the portrayal of characters posing as men.
He added: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is it that they teach us on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain mold of male behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young man."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not have agreed to prequels or sequels of the Game of Thrones series after it ended the following summer, saying that he had "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard’s play True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he considers dating his current wife Rose to be the best thing that the series “Game of Thrones” has brought him.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Igrith, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in cases
China has reported a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS of 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus is transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a burning problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus often occurs due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff published data on GOP senators, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff published the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat pointed out that these claims are being promoted by experts and websites of the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and even more hideous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Leah and Orina Hetsch, of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and published information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
“This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate claims – is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew condemnation online, as did former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial smells of rage,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He can't be insolent.
We can't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer compared Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too furious at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” his tweet read.
Waters said her office had informed “relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English – Back in Action – a lukewarm satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a Brexit subtext in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this sequel to the satirical action comedy franchise about Johnny English – which began back in 2003 with the release of Johnny English and came back to life in 2011.
Will the ironic autosaturation of what we obviously garbage be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the grumpy, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber-like face was given a new opportunity to mess something up – with his name more than anything revealing that it was a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinema audience English is not their native language.
It is, of course, about a cunning secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamor, carries a little Clouseau, a tinsel of Mr. Bean and a crumb of that guy who played only one note as part of the thematic melody of the realization of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It was also originally based on the passenger and mystery man in the international setting that Atkinson once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
In this latest installment about Johnny English, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly rattle on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially given that "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now regularly include comic elements.
Humor leaves the impression that it is intended for children, not adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as inventive and elaborate to the dance as Atkinson’s silent-movie gags were when he played Bean.
It is now a very topical issue that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of agents on duty—unfortunately, little roles for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character modeled on Theresa May, but the script is quite poor.
Advisors from the intelligence service inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
It's head and bearded Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides a spying academy in the spirit of the film "School of Rock."
In an emergency, English returns to Whitehall for instructions and reunites with former patient assistant Bow, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to the commander of the submarine, in the interpretation of Vicky Pepperdin who is somewhat superfluous.
And so the clumsy and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ofelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bau begin their odyssey of comic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant, make a mess by smuggling themselves onto Volta’s luxury yacht, and English sets off a veritable anarchy by trying to get to know the inside of Volta’s house using virtual reality headsets.
Obviously, a lot of effort was put into that last sequence, but no matter how cute and cheerful it was, the whole film seemed to be made for children.
Pretty average quality.
As with the other Johnny English films, I cannot help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
The Labour Party has denied making a plan for Britons to work four days a week and be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan that would see the British work four days a week – and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the time they save to workers thanks to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend – but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit in" with the party's economic agenda and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The move to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that by the end of the year there will be a re-examination of the legislation.
"Change is not going to happen overnight," but the four-day workweek is a goal that fits into the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in a number of ways, both in the workplace and in the workplace.
The Labour Party was not the first to embrace such an idea; the Green Party had pledged a four-day working week during the campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, such a yearning does not seem to be working for the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The fourth day of the week is not a part of the party's game, and the party is not to be considered."
Shadow Minister John Macdonald used the Labour Party's most recent conference to lay out his vision of a socialist revolution in the works.
Mr. Macdonald said he was determined to get power back from "impotent directors" and "profiters" in public enterprises.
The Minister's plans in the shadows also agree that the current employees in the current companies may not be able to get their full share of the "Labour's share" because the "Labour's share" would be lost.
He also confirmed plans to bring 500 employees into the company's proper department and to establish an Inclusive Ownership Fund, through which 10 percent of the company's employees would be brought into the company.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" if they could change their minds about the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
The FBI's investigation into the main charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been delayed for at least a week by the final vote on his name and the name of the member of the jury.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the reporter for 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley, asked the Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find out what they were up to.
Kennedy was more open about his South Carolina college career than he was about to be.
"I mean, anyway," Kennedy said.
“I said, going to the hearing, I said that I had talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him up after what had happened when the charges were filed, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, he was determined, he was unintelligible."
However, it appears that Graham's voice has been implicated in the stone.
"I made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would not have been changed by the most explosive accusation," he said.
"I don't know what it was about Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett has decidedly given up everything," Graham said, referring to Christine Blassey Ford.
"And no one she's mentioned has been able to confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I wouldn't say that something new is going to happen."
What is the "Global Citizen" festival and has it contributed to the decline of poverty in any way?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, a year-long musical event with a long and impressive roster of performers and nothing less than an impressive international mission.
It's the seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival in the big city of Central Park. Tens of thousands of people are going to be there, and they're not just going to enjoy the show, they're going to enjoy the performance of the lead singer.
GLOBAL CITIZEN FESTIVAL, which was held for the first time in 2012, was an introduction to the project of the eradication of global poverty, an international group of people living in poverty, and a number of other countries.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the visitors of the concert had to do a series of tasks, such as "actions" on the way to volunteering, on the way to the event, and on the way to the event.
But how much success has the Global Citizen achieved, having in mind the 12 years remaining until the goal is achieved?
Is the idea of installing a free concerto the right way to get people to believe that they are being called to action, or is it just another case of the so-called "clichism" in question?
The GLOBAL CITIZEN’S ORGANIZATIONS claim that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million shares of their adherents aimed at achieving a number of different goals.
They're saying that these actions helped ensure that by 2030, the world's leaders would start to announce their goals and lose over 37 billion dollars worth of money that would have an impact on people's lives.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 of its targets and announced the results of its actions, for which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected so far have directly impacted more than 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key programs include The Power of Extinction, a partnership of investors and contractors set up in the UK to "help children grow up in their full-fledged lives" and to "help children grow up in their full-fledged lives."
"With the support of the Government of the UK, the Donors, the National Authorities and the citizens of the world in 2018, along with you, there is a social failure in the form of inadequacy of the Government of the UK.
The group also said that after more than five thousand shares of the United Kingdom's stock had been sold, it had been called in to improve the nutrition of the mother and child, the government had announced that it was closing in on them.
On one of the frequently asked questions on their website, which reads, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The global citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult road – on it there will be both failure and failure.
But as we've been chosen before by the great human right and as they've succeeded in turning the tide of apartheid, we'll succeed, and we'll do it because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monet are some of the performers who are making appearances at this year's event in New York City, whose home they're coming to.
The U.S. could use the Navy to block the export of Russian energy, according to the minister of internal affairs.
Washington may "need" to rely on its navy to prevent Russian energy supplies from reaching the main market, including the Middle East, the U.S., the U.S., the U.S., the U.S., and the U.S.
Zinki was told that he was engaging Russia in Syria – where, specifically, he was intervening to call for legitimate power – a mask for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence on the Middle East is because they want to sell their energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and in Southern Europe," he said.
And for this officer, there are ways and means to prevent this from happening.
"The United States has the potential, with the assistance of our Navy, to ensure the opening of sea lanes and, if necessary, to block them, if we can make sure they're there."
Zinki addressed the audience at an event in the organization of the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer."
He went on to direct Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, arguing that they were essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of energy," he said, telling Russia that he was "very much aware of it" and that he was "very much aware of it."
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase the export of its current natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which it has been trying to sell to Russia, which it has been trying to sell to Russia.
In pursuit of that goal, officials from the Trump administration, including its own president, U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the U.S. military, and they're trying to persuade the U.S. to abandon the U.S. military.
Moscow has been insisting that the Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, should double the capacity of the country's 110-billion-strong pipeline, and that it should double the capacity of the country's 110-billion-strong pipeline.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's tough stance on this project is simply fueled by economic considerations and represents an example of unfair competition. The Kremlin's stance on this issue has been taken seriously by the Kremlin.
"I believe that we are making a point that the energy minister is using it as a means of exerting pressure on Russia and that the consumers should have the potential to have the opportunity to choose the energy supplier," he said.
The US has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the energy policy of the European Union and the bilateral relations between it and the European Union.
"I am very disturbed by the interference of the third countries in our supply of energy," said Dieter K<0xC3><0xA4>mff, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) in a statement.
Elizabeth Warren will “think well” about her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, according to a Massachusetts senator, who is a member of the House of Representatives.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think well" about running for president after she was elected to half her term as president.
In a meeting with the city administration in Holcock, Massachusetts, Vorenova confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington, D.C., and it's time for our dysfunctional government, and that includes the woman at the top," she said, according to the Hill newspaper.
"After the 6th of November, I will think well about the candidature for the presidency."
During the meeting with the city administration, Voronova criticized President Donald Trump, saying that “the country is leading in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Voronov is openly critical of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "We need an FBI investigation before the vote, of course."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even in its own constituency, the majority of voters did not consider that the 2020 election should be held in the country.
Five out of every five "trusted" voters in Massachusetts said the senator shouldn't have to run for office, according to the polls that were conducted by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of State.
Thirty-two percent of the candidates supported such a candidate.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Devalo Patrick, with 38 percent of the vote for the presidential candidate and 48 percent of the vote for the vice-presidential candidate.
Other names from the Democratic Party that have been mentioned in connection with a possible 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senate's nominee for the 2020 presidential election.
Biden said he would make the official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at the Donald Trump rally in Washington, D.C.
Trak Palin, 26, has spent an hour in Iraq since he enlisted in the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was brought in and charged with an incident of violence in the family.
"It's through what my son's going through, it's through what he's going through once he's back, I can understand the other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of them are coming in early.
Palin's story is about him, and she described it as an example of a big problem that everyone ignores, and she said about her son and the other wartime vets, "They're all about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me, they're about me,
He was brought in on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of violence in the family on the occasion of the assault of a woman, interference with the reporting of violence in the family, and of being a victim of violence in the family, and of being a victim of violence in the family and in the family.
18 states and the District of Columbia held a review of new regulations on the provision of asylum
The United States and the District of Columbia have held a legal review of a new U.S. law that provides for the denial of asylum to victims who are fleeing or are seeking asylum in the United States.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a "friend of the court" petition in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who wants to challenge the bill, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the suit, Grace, was given to him, and the date of the suit, which is the date on which the U.S. Civil War bond was established, is not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his sons, the members of the gang” resented her, but officials from the United States refused her request for asylum on June 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The state attorneys-at-law who provide the legal support for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, the countries from which a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S. are coming to the United States, where they are currently seeking asylum.
A new U.S. asylum law has terminated a 2014 decision that was made by the Board of Immigrants in the U.S., and by the Board of Immigrants in the U.S. without the consent of the Board of Immigrants in the U.S.
Colombia's top lawmaker, Carl Raysin, said on Friday that the new rule "ignores the decade of the state, state, and international law."
"The relevant law requires that all decisions on all requests for asylum shall be made on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the persons "in accordance with the principle" of "the right to asylum", and in accordance with the principle of "the right to asylum".
The lawyers further stated in the document that the regulation that prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. economy, saying that they were more likely to be present at the time of their arrival, and that they "were both present at the time of their arrival."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims who are fleeing family violence and rape in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their motherland for the sake of reason or fear of reason on the basis of race, creed, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, nationality, etc.
The purpose of asylum has never been to solve all the problems—even all the serious problems—with which people all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate attempts are being made to rescue Palu, and the death toll is doubling as the race to find the survivors continues.
The survivors were faced with an increasingly dire situation.
"It's very exciting," says 35-year-old mother Rhys Kusum, as he dies of a baby boy crying horribly in an evacuation center in the desolate town of Palu.
“I need to get to the car every few minutes.
We don't have enough clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through the rest of the property and trying to save everything they can get away with.
There's been injuries to hundreds of people, and the hospitals hit by the earthquake at a magnitude of 7.5 are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwy Harris, who suffered from a fractured spine and shoulder, were lying in front of the military hospital in Palu, where the patients were being treated unresponsive.
His eyes filled with tears told him how he felt as he shook the ground violently shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It wasn’t time to save us.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to celebrate the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s voice, how she was shaking, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Abuse of Propaganda Ads’
A week later, it was reported that an official Chinese newspaper had published a four-page ad in a newspaper in the United States, highlighting the increased benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Embassy said.
President of the United States, Donald Trump, mentioned the last Wednesday of China's paid contribution to the Dumoyne Register, the most recently submitted list in the state of Iowa, on the last Wednesday of the month.
Trump's allegations that Beijing attempted to interfere in the U.S. election have revealed what U.S. officials have described to Reuters as a new phase in the Washington, D.C., campaign.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war in the United States, and the U.S. is in the midst of an escalating trade war.
The goal of China's retaliatory tariffs in the early phase of the trade war was to get out of the states along the way to Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, according to experts.
Teri Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former longtime governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Peking had violated the U.S. Constitution and that he had violated the U.S. Constitution.
As Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly issue of the Dimoyne Register, China "is now taking us even further by publishing the latest ad in our own language."
“By spreading its message, China’s power is benefiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, by publishing the payment of the bill in the Dimma newspaper,” he said.
"On the other hand, in the newsroom on the streets of Beijing, you're going to find a few opposing voices, and you're not going to see any real opposition from the opposing minds, and you're not going to see any real opposition from the opposing minds.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined an offer to publish" his article, but he did not know which newspaper it was.
Analysts are warning that Republicans are estranged from women's voices before the election of half of the incumbent, due to the fact that he is with Judge Kavanaugh.
Although many at the top of the Republican Party are supporting and defending candidates for a member of the Bret Kavanaugh Supreme Court, they are facing higher charges in connection with the sexual assault charges against them.
The emotions associated with this situation are extremely strong, and for most Republicans, they already know that they want to give him their vote.
Such things are impossible to say," said Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell faculty at Syracuse University, in an article published in the Hill newspaper on Monday.
Richer expressed doubt that the insistence of Sen. Jeff Flake (Arizona) on an FBI investigation in the last minute would be enough to appease the injured voice.
“She’s not going to forget what happened last night — she’s not going to forget it tomorrow, or in November,” said Caryn Jean-Pierre, a senior councillor, on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted "November is coming!" until they entered the Senate corridor, as they were Republicans, who were in control of the Justice Department's decision-making process.
“Democracy’s enthusiasm and motivation will reach an unscathed conclusion,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political activist on the news site.
“People say it’s already on the higher ground, that’s true.
But they can grow and continue to grow, especially among the indecisive female voice actors from the suburbs and the younger voice actors, from 18 to 29 years old, who often don't have a voice, despite the fact
Even prior to the public testimony in which Mr. Ford described in detail the allegations of a sexual assault by a foreign candidate on behalf of a member of the Supreme Court, a member of the Supreme Court.
“This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, about NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote, or the final vote, or whether or not it’s going to be done in court, it’s also about the way that the Republicans have found out here and there.
However, it seems that the Americans were divided on the question of who they believed the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a few more of those who were with them the next day.
A new survey conducted by the agency South suggests that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believe that Ford's testimony is true, while 35 percent of them believe that it is true or false.
In addition, 38 percent of them said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent of them thought the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford's testimony last week at the arraignment was before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was in an alcoholic's state of mind when she was attacked by a 17-year-old.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genius at the time of the party they attended during the Yale studios in the 1980s.
The invention of the World Wide Web (WWW) plans to create a new internet that would rival Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup project whose goal is to challenge Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The most recent draft of this tech legend, "Inrupt," represents a company built on the Berners-Lee platform that was set up by Solid.
The balance of users allows them to choose where their data will be stored and who will be able to access which information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company magazine, Berners-Lee found that the intent behind the Inrupt project was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the launch.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their “personal space for online storage of data,” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all simultaneously available in one browser.
What is unique about the personal space for online storage is that it is exclusive to the user, depending on which user can access which information.
The company calls it "personal experience through the data" and it's not.
The idea behind Inrupt, as Director-General John Bruce says, is that a company must ensure resources, processes and skills are in place to help everyone do their part.
The company is currently meeting from Berners-Lee, Bruce, an unsecured payment company purchased from I.B.M., a number of permanent contractors and contractors for the company's operations.
Starting this week, it's up to the entire world to create their own children's apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not I'm going to know the full change that's going to happen to all of their recent friends.
“We’re not asking for permission from them.”
In a statement on Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and a single ecosystem that will be able to help with that as well."
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts, where he founded the World Wide Web Consortium.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been one of the most influential voices in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Although the Inrupt launcher, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the grid," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Dedication to the priest from the First World War, the bearer of the Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have been awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War, is to be honoured in his native city of 100 years old.
Lt. Col. Bernard Van served this occasion on September 29, 1918, on the occasion of the attack on Belangliz and Leokur.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never realized that he had achieved the highest British military distinction.
His two granddaughters on Saturday opened the memorial plaque during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plate had been uncovered exactly 100 years after the feat that his grandfather had made.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the channel to Saint-Quentin's "through a thick fog, and through a thick fog, there was a
He then rushed to the firing line and, with the "most powerful of the Juna<0xC3><0xAF>ves," led the charge before he independently attacked an artillery piece and knocked three men out of the building.
Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but something that causes a lot of things to happen."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also made a grant to the Crown after the parade that was led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to have participated in the parade" and added "that he was the world's rightful hero, and that he had grown up to be a great hero."
The MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and they got Peppa Pig instead.
You'd think you'd stay up all night watching Bellator 206, and you'd be unable to watch the main event.
The event at San Jose involved 13 fights, including a sixth in the main play and in the UK was broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Geghard Mussassi and Rory Macdonald were about to face each other, the spectators in the UK were left to fend for themselves when they were transferred to Pepa Pres.
Some of them were distraught as if they'd stayed awake until early in the morning because of your struggle.
One fan described the childish cartoon on Twitter as “a kind of sick joke” in a recitation.
"According to state law, that 6 a.m. content was not included, but they had to try to get the children out of the program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the department of education and training.
"Pepa Prace, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said he was going to work on his pro-gramming scheme to include future UK viewers.
“I think as far as the reps are concerned, I think we’re probably going to be able to get it done,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we can’t do that until we get to our own time, the next day to theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the news broke, there were a lot of orders and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a matter of technical disturbance.
But it wasn't, it was a problem in the state.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're going to stick to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — we've tried to give the two of us more than usual, and we've just gone too far.
There is an unfortunate situation in the question."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' About Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew out of a sense of inferiority in relation to another for the sake of his sexuality—but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old says that the seniors at the elementary school didn't realize "they're not all like him."
In an interview on Radio 4's first issue of Desert Island Discs with host Lauren LaVerne, he said he was talking about gay rights as if he would "give it to others."
He also said he's been less concerned about winning the Olympics since he was born.
A regular host of a long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Giving the impression of having been rejected by a person in Laverne's first broadcast, Daley said he felt "more worthy" of the others until he had grown up and was "not a socialite at all."
He said, "By the time of yesterday, that feeling of being less valuable and different, those were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that there was “something and something,” he said, as if he wouldn’t tell everyone when they were on the edge of knowing about his sexuality.
A two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games has become an outspoken fighter for LGBT rights and has taken advantage of his advance on this year's Games at the Commonwealth Games in Austria.
He says that he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live open, without consequences, and because he wanted to "hit" others.
A three-time world champion says he was "surprised" by a falling in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than he was last year, but they say the difference in the years has never been a problem.
“When you’ve been through so much at such an early age,” he said, “he went to the first Olympics at 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, and that’s when he said he was 14 years old.”
The two were born in June, they had a son, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley told him that he had "completely changed his outlook".
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been just ‘I have to get my gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
She's my gold olympic medalist."
His son carries the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being discovered to have brain cancer.
Daley says that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of his last questions was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London - it was in London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to live to be first in line,'" he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and when he died did I finally realize he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’d been dreaming about all my life – to be in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
This feeling was also inspired by his choice of the first song "Praud" by Heather Small, who was rehearsing with him in preparation for the Olympics and from where he and I have been since.
The Desert Island Disc show airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson's exit from the company put him on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record in the week when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to go back to the farm again if he wants to avoid a fight.
Mickelson, who is taking part in this two-year-old event for the 12th time, Captain Jim Furik has been on the bench for Saturday's game with four balls and a game in hand.
Instead of being in the action center, like so often in the United States, a five-time champ is going to be doing his job as a cheerleader, and he's going to be doing his job.
Since not even at the peak of the career was the most precise in the long-term matches, this 48-year-old is not the ideal candidate for the narrow field of "Le golf" in the long-term.
And if I don't feel like I'm doing enough to embarrass myself, Mickelson is in a nine-game match on Sunday, facing off against champ Brittish in a showdown with France's Molinari.
If the Americans, who commit 12 individual swords at four-point intervals, had a hard start, Michaelson's sword could be absolutely doomed.
Furik said he had faith in his man, though he couldn't say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he walked me over to my back, he hugged me and he said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of self-esteem.
His name is in the Hall of Fame, and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and so much to this week.
I probably wasn't planning on him playing two matches.
I've been planning more, but that's how it turned out, and that's the way we decided we needed to go.
He wanted to be there, as much as anyone else."
Mickelson's going to break Nick Faldo's record for the most non-matches ever played in the Ryder Cup.
That could be the end of one career in the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson had 18 assists, 20 assists, and seven draws, but Fourick says his absence made his mark on the team.
“He’s oblivious, sarcastic, funny, likes to joke with people and it’s great to have him in the team space,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to tease him, and he didn’t care, which was a fun thing to look at.
He's got a lot more to offer than the game itself."
European Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the future.
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows from experience that a significant advance ahead of the last day of the individual matches at Ryder's Cup may well be a breakthrough in the morning.
Danac made his debut in 1997 in a match against Valderami, where the side that led the All Ballester<0xC3><0xB3>s had a head start from the fifth inning against the Americans, but it's still on the run.
"I'm just starting to remember that in 2018, we had a big advantage over Walder; we had a big advantage over Brooklyn, where we lost, and we had a big advantage over Walder, where we won, where we were.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not the end of it.
Tomorrow we'll go full steam.
Let's go out there and do whatever it takes.
Nothing's done until you've got the right one on you.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win this trophy, and that's where the focus will stay.
That's what I'm saying all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what the other side is - the best players in the world."
Excited by his players’ play on the difficult golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn added: “I would never run in front of the ore as far as that is concerned.
Tomorrow is something completely different.
Tomorrow, the individual act will come to the scene, and it will require a different game.
It's nice to be there with the partner when things go as they should, but when you're there on your own, it's time to test your golfing capacity.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he's the same way he's got to get out and get everything out of himself."
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, rival team captain Jim Furik is looking to his players for a better one-on-one performance than the one they've had with the partners, except for Jared, who's the only one who's been in the game.
And Furik himself was on both sides of those big turnarounds in the last day, first as part of the post-WWII team at Brooklyn, and then as a loser when the European team performed "The Miracle in Brooklyn."
"I remember literally every word," he said when asked how Ben Cranshaw, a captain from 1999, had raised the morale of his players until they were ready to go.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important swords, but it would be good to have a quick start like the one you saw on Brooklyn and the one you saw on Medina.
When that moment starts in a single right-hander, a great deal of pressure is exerted on the central sword.
We're doing our job, and the boys are doing what we think they're supposed to do, so, you know, we're trying to do a little magic tomorrow."
Tom was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the final match, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, and Jodie O'Reilly.
“I started with this group of guys in that order because I think that’s how we cover everything up to the end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn made his selection for the individual match.
NEW DELHI FOR NEW GERMAN WARSHIPS
Our newest frigate, the German Navy, was supposed to be in the middle of 2014 when it would have replaced the old ships from the Cold War era, but it's not going to be the cold war anymore.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Zeit newspaper.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troublesome aftermath of the deployment has damaged the future of this ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the frigate's replacement, the Bremen.
It's also known that there will be a number of powerful weapons, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as a number of technological advances, such as the introduction of a new type of anti-ship, anti-ship and anti-ship missile.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of work without maintenance – it should be possible for our newest frigate to be seen for two years in a row in the morning.
However, the constant postponement means that these very early warships – which were supposed to enable Germany to project its power on the sea – will already be in the sea, but they will not be in the sea.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made it to the newsroom last year when the German Navy official refused to take the ship and returned it to Bulgaria, and returned it to Bulgaria.
It was the first time a sailor had returned a ship to the shipyard after the discharge.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the non-German media have reported more crucial "defects on the software and hardware" that would have made this warship a warship, which would have made it a warship.
Software deficiencies were of particular importance, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class would have been operating at a rate of about 120 seamen – only half of the population would have been on board.
Also, it turned out that his mother-in-law's boat had been drastically overrun, which would have diminished his performance and limited the potential of the Marines to make it to shore at a later date.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons twice as much as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the fake hardware, the price of the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also started to present a problem.
They say that it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
He's having trouble with the latest frigate, and he's coming up with reports in light of recent warnings about a change in the power of the German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the department for defense in the German parliament, confirmed that the Marines were in the process of "resuming the ship's services".
This official has said that in time things are getting more serious and more serious, because the ships have been diverted without the introduction of the Zamena vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of blind mice
A new study conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how the blind mice of a geographer of the Great Plains in search of a horse are blind mice.
The researchers hope that the findings will shed new light on the resurgence of these unique flying mammals and help direct future activities in order to achieve their goals.
The research of a scientist from the National Fund for Scotland will follow the usual and dwarf blind muscles, as well as the brown long-eared bats and the watering of the evening in Inv<0xC3><0xAB>rka.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations across a wide range of properties in order to monitor the activity of blind mice over the course of the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) will also carry out mobile examinations by hand-held detectives.
An expert analysis of the sound from all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the voices of the blind mice and what kind of work they are doing.
They will then be provided with a detailed map of the habitat along with a report on how to get a picture of their stay in relation to the terrain.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at the Fund, is hoping to find out which areas of the habitat are the most important for the blind mouse, and in what ways it is the most important for the blind mouse.
These information will help to determine the importance of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the manner in which we can best manage the forest for the sake of others.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development works that affect nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also present risks, as well as sticky fly traps, and some types of chemical treatments for building materials and materials, such as chemtrails, and chemtrails.
Blind mice aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They rely on sophisticated echo-location techniques to determine the exact position of the insect and the obstacle on the path in the summertime.
The NTS Fund, which is in charge of the care of over 270 buildings of the historical significance, 38 important towers and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious.
The foundation has a dozen trained experts who regularly conduct research, check nesting grounds, and sometimes rescue operations.
This organization has even created the first and only purpose-built reserve for bats in Scotland, at Triv's in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which is back home with us.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that this property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Trivo we have a great space for blind mice," he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habitat as a whole.
But there's a lot about blind mice that's still not clear, and we're going to work here and on other properties to help us better understand what they need us to do.
He emphasizes the importance of verifying the presence of blind mice before performing work on the holding in the property complex, because it is the accidental destruction of one nesting site and the possibility of killing one nesting site.
Blind mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb and destroy their nesting grounds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official at the Foundation for the Protection of the Blind Mice, encourages the public to get involved and make their own contribution.
She says, "And there's still a lot we need to learn about our blind mice, and there's a lot of our species that we don't even know how to count."
Ronaldo dropped the rape charges, filed a lawsuit against him, and filed a lawsuit against a German magazine, The New York Times.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "wanted to speak out" using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German magazine Spiegel, which published the information on you.
The Juventhus-Portugal striker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He immediately paid her $375,000 to keep her from talking about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Turning over 142 million of his stalkers in Instagram Live saw some of the accusations made public, Ronaldo (33) dismissed the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today was false news," the five-time Golden Balls champion said in his cell.
“They want to use my name to promote themselves.
That's normal.
He wants to make me famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the football player with a smile.
Ronald’s attorneys are preparing to sue Spiegel for a claim they described as “unacceptable reports of suspicions about the area of privacy,” Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the football player would be looking for any "moral damage" in connection with the birth of the child's personal infraction, which is likely to be the case soon after the birth of the child.
The incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Majorga were suddenly returned to the player's room, where he was suddenly raped, according to a statement from the court in the district court.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, fell to his knees, claiming that he was "99 percent a good guy" but that he had let go because of those "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was on a benevolent basis.
Majorga claims that she went to the police with photos of her injuries committed in the hospital, but that she suddenly accepted the court's order because she "felt worse" and "felt worse".
These 34-year-old women say they now want to cancel the deal because they still have the trauma of the incident.
Ronaldo was in the midst of a major attack on the morning of the transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer, for the first time in 100 million euros, he made it to Italy.
Brexit: UK ‘would never have survived’ car manufacturer’s loss
UK "would never have survived" if after Brexit lost the status of world leader in a car, said Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had made a statement to the BBC that it would, in the event that Britain left the EU without an agreement, have been able to deliver a timely response to the UK's decision to leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer has said that if it were to stay on the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it would result in a loss of jobs.
The factory in Barnaston – which produced the Toyota Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars a year ago, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My point of view is that we’re going to have a major exit at the factory if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March,” says Marvin Cook, director of the Toyota factory in Barnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of the cesspool.
B.M.V., for example, says that after Brexit, on the first day of the month, they're going to set up their factory at the Minnie Mark in Oxford.
The main reasons for concern are the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the car's originators.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of "just in time", where parts for ordered cars arrive in about 37 minutes from the customer from the UK and EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, it could come to the border with what industry representatives say could lead to a delay and a shortage of supplies.
Toyota wouldn't have been able to store an inventor for more than one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company had cancelled, and the company would have been shut down.
Clarke says there's a plan by Theresa May of Chequers for a future relationship with the EU "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that we can make possible, as I would say, not just an instant success, but an instant success, it's an opportunity I'm going to use," he said.
"The evidence isn't just from Toyota, it's from other vendors, and they're saying that we absolutely have to be in a position to do what we've been told in the past.
Toyota couldn't say how long it would take to leave the factory, but it did warn us that over the next few years, the cost of building a new factory would be reduced, and the cost of building a new one would be reduced.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Barnaston for 24 years and is a member of the United Trade Unions in the factory, says that his members are all the more concerned: "I am, in my opinion, about
The government spokesman said: "We have come up with a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, they say at the White House.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy State's Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "debated for another week" while he's on the case.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, links Trump's aides to Russia, and empowers the U.S. government to do so.
The question of whether or not Trump is going to replace the deputy chief of staff or not, and thereby threaten Maler's independence, has been the subject of months of speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wiretapping a wiretap to record a conversation with Trump and the power of the 25th.
Rosenstein's rejected that lead.
But the last Monday he went to the White House, despite the fact that we were told that he was about to make a deposit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that "the leaks wouldn't" have replaced Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a misunderstanding and a hearing in the court of law.
On Friday, Trump authorized a one-week investigation by the FBI into the base charges of the Cowan case, by delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's print rep, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News channel on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein, she replied, "She's not quite sure of the date yet, there could be more of these things, there could be more of these things, there could be more of these things, there could be more of these things, there could be more of them, there could be more of them, there's more of them, there's more of them.
But we'll see, and I'll always be there for the press, and I'll be happy to inform you."
Some reporters might dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference at the White House as of September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace was asking for what it was.
Sanders said that the prioritization of a statement is not a consequence of the rejection of the journalist's desire to "attract attention," but she said, "I wouldn't give up on it if it were true."
And then she announced that there would be a direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president has a higher degree of conferencing in which he answers questions than any other president before him,” she said, without elaborating on the source: “We’ve talked about it before.
And there will still be press releases, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen.
We're trying to do it often, and you've seen that we've done it in a lot of ways over the last few weeks, and it's going to be done in place of the press release, and it's going to be done in a lot of ways.
Trump has regularly responded to questions about his departure from the White House or when he participates in open sessions or news conferences with visiting officials, including the White House and the White House.
Self-conferencing for the print is rare.
The president may have shown up in New York this week for what it is, since he's been acting strangely in front of the assembled reporters, and bizarrely in front of the audience.
The Ministry of Health wrote to the EU workers in the National Health Service of Scotland on the grounds of the severity of the consequences of Brexit.
The Ministry of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union who work in the National Health Service of Scotland in order to express the gratitude of their country and invite them to stay.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter in a minute when she was less than six months away from the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of the resolved reports on the work of the citizens of the European Union who work in their respective public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations on the UK’s exit from the EU have been going on for the summer, following the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the U.K. government is also working on preparations for a possible scenario without complying with the agreement.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
That's why I want to reassess how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.

Christion Abercrombie has been rushed to the hospital after suffering a head injury.
Linebacker Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie has been rushed into action after suffering a head injury in a Saturday's match with the result of 31-27 of the Vand.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rhode Reed, told reporters that by the time he got to the head, he'd come in about half the time.
“He came to the outside line, and he just sort of colluded there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the car before they put him in the van and took him for questioning.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transported to the Vanderbilt Medical Center if he had been operated.
Harris said that "there's still no information about the type/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened by the time of the injury.
The Abercrombie, the red jersey from the second year, is currently in the first season with Tennessee State, just like the Illinois Transfer.
On Saturday, he had five rebounds before he left the game, which put the total number of rebounds in his 18th season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of tax stamps on the occasion of the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more for the purchase of real estate in the UK, and the additional income will be used to help homeless people in the building with the new plan.
This way, I'm not going to undo the success of Corbyn's move to attract younger voters.
The increase in the export of such stamps will apply to those who do not pay their taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged more for the sale of such stamps on the occasion of the purchase of real estate in the UK – and the additional income will be used for the benefit of the homeless, Theresa May, will be announced today.
This is going to be an attempt to neuter Jeremy Corbyn's success in trying to attract young people's voices by promising them access to him, and to give them access to him.
The increase in the amount of the stamp will be applied to the physical and legal person who does not pay the tax in the UK, and the additional money will be used for the contribution to the fight against corruption in the UK.
In addition to the above, which will be added to the already existing tax stamp, including the above-mentioned information two years ago from the other house and the purchase of the property, it will also be added to the existing tax stamp.
The Treasury expects that, thanks to this year's budget, it will be collected up to 120 million pounds.
It's estimated that 13 out of New York City in London buy non-residents of the UK, which raises prices and makes it easier for people who buy their first home to come to a residential area.
Many affluent parts of the country—especially the port—have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of well-to-do buyers who spend most of their time in the country.
The new regulation is only coming in a few weeks after Boris Johnson called to change that mark in order to help the young people get to their first one.
He accused a major city-owned firm of holding high real estate prices in such a way as to rob the country of it but did not use it and appealed to Prime Minister May "to waive the quota for access to it."
Corbyn has announced an impressive array of pre-existing reforms, including a check on the rent and the end of the undelivered e-mail.
He also wants us to get out of here so he can have more power over the construction of our new homes.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Minister’s mandate to the British Dream – that life be better for every new generation.
And that's the understanding and solution to the problem in our residential space market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it can't be right that buying real estate is going to be easy for individuals who don't live in the UK and a few foreign companies as well as for working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, until the lowering of homelessness has become too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland."
Sanderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "country ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish Representation at some point in his career.
Forty-two-year-old Scott is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
This summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I was in a B-team presentation, and that's it," Ross said on the Sportsound show on the Scottish BBC.
"But I grew up often watching Scotland at Hampden with my father while I was young, and that was something I'd always come back to.
However, such an opportunity would only have provided if I had been successful in running the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Adwokat, David Moyza, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gasa Pojeta, and Pao.
Former Allo Athletic boss says he's not afraid of coming up with such big names in such a big club, like he turned down an offer from Burnsley and Ipswich.
“The measure of success at this point will be ‘will I be able to get this club back into the Premier League’.
Given the structure and potential of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I'll be able to find success only if I can get the club back to where it belongs."
Ross is just in the third year of his managerial career, after the period he served as an aide-de-camp to the chief in Dumbarton and the 15 months he spent in training.
Then he helped Alois recover from the fall into the third division, and St. Mirren came from the edge of the fall into the lower league to the side of the champions in the next round.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did when he was playing a career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he said, recalling the takeover of the Aloe Club.
“I actually believed that management was doing the right thing for me, more than playing the game.
It sounds strange because I haven't been bad, I've worked hard since then, and I've enjoyed some solid successes.
But the game knows it's gonna be tough.
There's a lot of stuff going on that you have to do to get through on a weekday field trip.
And I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but the management is just fine with me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing that, in all my adult life, I haven't felt any better than I have now."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, research is open.
This summer's heat has increased the pressure on the British people who are fighting for a place to stay, but it has increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
In the group of residents and residents there was an increase in sales from 2.7 percent in July – but the percentage in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the consulting firm CGA, which has been processing the figures, said: "It's been a long sunny day and it's been a long time since the expected participation of the English in the world championship.
By the time we got to the restaurant from 1.8 in June, we'd only gotten worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drink had a far better effect with greater growth in the relationship compared to the comparable results from the previous period, but it was less than what was in the previous period.
Pubs focused on the food they ate for the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant's owners.
Looks like people just wanted to come out for a drink.
The chains of the townsfolk and the barmen increased the sale of drinks by 6.6 per cent in a month, and the sale of food by three per cent."
Paul Newman of the RSM agency for the analysis of forgetfulness and hospitality said: “These results are the trend we see from the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside of households.
It's no surprise that the rest of the group is going through a tough fight, although by the time they sell out at 4.8 percent this year, they're gonna be a little too sick with the presence of this guy.
It's been a long summer and it's not possible to get to the mountains in time to host a more food-focused dinner, and it's time to tell if it's going to provide the more moderate temperatures we've had in the past.
The total increase in sales in restaurants and pubs, including the new facilities, was 2.7 percent in July, while maintaining the implementation of the implementation of the new rules.

Every fifth child has a secret on the social networks that he hides from his parents.
Every fifth child – from whom some have only 11 years – has secrets on social networks that he hides from his parents and educators, the discovery of the research that he has been doing.
The research that covered more than 20,000 students of the higher education institutions of the primary school has revealed the number of “false Insta” pages.
These news have reinforced the fear of the publication of sexual content on the Internet.
Two-tenths of a second said he had a "head" on his family's lineage.
Every fifth child—some of whom are only 11 years old—has the right set of social networks to hide from the grown-ups.
A study that involved 20,000 high school seniors has uncovered a number of “false insts” on the site – which is based on the findings of a recent study.
This news has reinforced the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Two-tenths of a second said he had a clean "head" of the family, but that they also had a very good account.
One mother who ran a covert page on her 13-year-old daughter opened up to a teenage girl who calls the other a "suck me."
The research carried out by the state organization Digital Consciousness UK and Conferencing Director and Director (KMC) of independent schools, has revealed that there are 40 out of 18 schools in the country.
HMC President Mike Bjukkenon says, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create a space on the Internet for them to learn about their gender and their gender.
Ailey Doyle will be the "voice of the athlete" in the Scottish Athletics Board
Ailey Doyle was selected as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of that governing body.
Doyle is the most prolific Scottish athletics player, and Ian Beatty, the president, described this as a great opportunity for those in the water who are in the water to gain access to the track and field from it.
“Ailye enjoys great respect from the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are sure that the athletics team in Scotland will have enormous benefits from her membership,” she said.
Doyle said, "I want to be an athlete's voice and hope that I can actually contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American who won four Olympic gold medals, including a 200- and 400-meter field goal at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is now a regular Olympic gold medallist, and an Olympic gold medalist.
He wrote on Twitter: “About a month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only be a matter of time before I knew if I was going to recover and to what extent.
It was a busy job, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you so much for your help in the healing process!"
I'm talking about a milk-extortion pump in which the mother's milk is ordered by the cows, and I'm sharing my thoughts on the Internet.
The company that produces the pumps for extortion divided the opinions on the Internet by saying that the milking company is in order with the cows of the musers.
To mark the launch of a launcher that has been described as "the first unstoppable pump for extortion to be carried under the thorax," the developer of the launcher is a consumer electronics company.
Four real mothers dancing in the barn between a dream and a cow next to a song whose lyrics say, "Yes, I can, but I don't have a tail," and "Maybe you didn't notice, but you didn't, but you didn't."
"Pump, pump, I feed my babies, pump, pump, pump, I can do it myself."
However, a report posted on the company's Facebook page caused a stir in the internet's control of the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of customers, the video elicited a variety of reactions from viewers, while many said it lessened the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“Using the cow to sell this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are being taken away from them a few days after birth,” he wrote.
Pump for milking Elvie discreetly stands in December for milking (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
"But why don't you use it to say, 'Pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?'"
Someone said, "That's a very unthinking ad."
Others stood on the side of the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "hurricane".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd like to make sure I'm still breastfeeding.
It's the pumping that made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a bit of a joke, but I figured it out just the way it was supposed to be.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented, "This is a funny ad aimed at moms who are milking (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like they're being milked.
This isn't about who's boasting or where the dairy industry is."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of storytelling is based on the realization that many mothers who extort milk say that they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, she has no wires or tubes, and she's standing in December to breastfeed, which gives women the freedom to move, to hold their babies, even while she's out.
Anna Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, gave the comment: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it’s worth it and it’s worth it.
By drawing a parallel between female and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the grooming and challenges it brings with it, as well as to present the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a fun and engaging way that women can relate to.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has reached the headlines of the press.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to Temporary Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the harsh rhetoric and policies the Trump administration has introduced to make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
As usual, the sponsors were mostly undocumented illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that they will jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country if they step forward and look for a child.
The risk was heightened in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must submit fingerprints, as well as that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, confirmed to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had signed up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of persons who were sponsors or household members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminally prosecuted foreigners.
That’s why we’re still chasing these people,” Mr. Albens said.
According to the shelter workers, in order to process the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Most will use a conference video to apply for legal status to an immigration judge instead of attending in person.
Those found not to be eligible for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes, according to the shelter workers and reports from the system over the previous months.
Advocates say concerns about this are heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is being tortured can be easily overlooked because of its size.
They add that moving children to a temporary settlement without leaving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells ‘occupying forces’ of US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be "treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have fled their homeland.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight its holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “the entire illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the soil of a war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Muallem said there were satisfactory conditions for their return and accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fear” that keeps refugees out of the country.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help their return," he said.
“They’re making a policy out of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a vacuum zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has led to the creation of opportunities for further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has diverted attention from large-scale attacks by Syrian forces that enjoy Russian support in the province of three million people.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the target of military action will be jihadists along with fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which will "be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to have the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon, with the aim of drawing up a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of that panel should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump could win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, accusations and scandals end his rule before then.
In what would no doubt be “the most dramatic final episode of a presidential career in history!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Viewing in prime time has more than doubled since 2014, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, which is more than the 1.7 million they had four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC’s “Rachel Meadow Show” holds the top spot on cable television with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the most important news days.
“It’s an element that people get sucked into because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Baer, ABC’s executive producer on the show “Doer of Duty,” which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after destroying the Capitol in an attack.
Nell Scovel, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Fun Parts: And a Few Painful Truths About Hollywood Behind the Scenes, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him why.
Miss Scovel says he answered her, "Because she makes me laugh."
Chaos also has the value of fun.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the plots coming from Washington can determine the future of women’s right to decide on abortion, on whether immigrant families will be able to unite and on the state of the global economy.
Turning off the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it goes a little beyond the status of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching for six hours as a panel of experts discusses how Bob Woodward in his book “Fear” places information as fact, about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket (“a piece set to pride,” as the Washington Post called it).
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“One part of his behavior that makes it all look like a reality show is that he offers us content every night,” says Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “The Betting Stars,” about the changing of characters and the day-to-day plot of the Trump show.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you’re lagging behind.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up inside and was live-streaming MSNBC and filming CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh faces the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“I remember at the time, when we were doing all those crazy shows, people were saying this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” says Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought they were joking, but I think they were right.”

Foreign money inflow amid tense race for early House elections
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving inflows of money, thanks to a reshuffle of congressional districts that has seen two lawmakers each fighting for the same seat.
Conor Lamb, a Democrat from the suburban district of Pittsburgh, won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is in a race with another lawmaker, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had unconstitutionally rigged the election results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th triggered a contest to fund campaigns between major party financiers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely-watched special election in March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The place was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
Political connoisseurs have given Trump a slight advantage.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China, Retreats
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until partners moved the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the penalties applied only to El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The punitive measures imposed, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly fall on a Central American country that already has a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to accompany a similar gathering last year that they saw as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading toward the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear they wanted the conference to take place and put an end to all questions about El Salvador’s penalization.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would attend the conference, whose new term is mid-October, indicating the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal matters on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable thing is likely to be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, as there is now substantial evidence in public sources.
Mueller is also reportedly launching an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the election attacks.
If Congress were to fall into the wrong hands, Trump would face accountability in that body, as he prepares to stand before voters again, and possibly before the courts of colleagues.
That’s a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s defeat is inevitable – nor is the defeat of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if the West were able to resist him and repel the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the slaughter that followed in the years to come.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who presides over the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in unscathed grapes since the newspaper reported that last year he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and commented on his ineligibility for office.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is incorrect.
“How do we respond when the newly launched Brett Kavanaugh investigation at the FBI is neither complete nor fair, or if it gets Supreme Court approval, despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the early election for a Congress that Mr. Trump thinks is credible?
If we fail those exams, democracy is in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers optimistic before meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive tie with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would bring them a solid position for qualifying from the Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Doran, a midfield player, was unable to make an appearance in the season due to a knee injury until 2–2 tie with Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for larger goals.
“It’s a good point for us because Villarreal is in a better position,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the belief that we could win something, and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could get them in the end, but considering everything, the even result is quite fair.
They were probably better than us in the first half, but we came back in the second and took the lead.
Thursday is fast approaching and it will be another big night for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had an excellent result from the last game. Although, with the audience on our side, I am sure that we can catch up and get a positive result.
The past year has been very difficult, with everything that has happened to me with the injuries and changes at the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, the training is good.
We hope that now we can get a grip, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women are worried about saving for retirement.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, very few of them talked about it with families.
About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they talked to spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they’ve talked to their kids about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance group Nationwide.
Here’s how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for caregiving if you don’t introduce them to your wishes well in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, decide where and how you want to receive care because these are choices that greatly affect costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include the usual long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that involves money and value to cover costs, or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documentation: Warn court disputes.
Get a health care assistant to have a trusted person you can trust to take care of medical care and that health care professionals are aware of your wishes in case you are unable to make a statement on your own.
Also, consider giving the authority to manage your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid on time if you are not able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your aging parent comes into a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you give answers to questions about medications and allergies?
Give those details in writing so you’re ready.
“It’s not just finances that’s at stake, it’s questions like who are the doctors?” asks Martina.
“What medications do you use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan for all of this.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracom
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home from the exit.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in an area of Ilfracoma in Devon called Oxford Grove when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and police have asked witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, according to official sources.
Because of the severed ties, emergency officials were unable to obtain information from the Dongale Regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu since the disaster struck.
Here are the most important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was in the midst of a celebration of the 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated half-life of 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of North Sulawesi Province relies heavily on fishing and animal husbandry, especially in the coastal area of Dongale.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the Morovali area, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulevasi.
Palu and Dongala have experienced multiple tsunami impacts in the past 100 years, according to records from the Disaster Management Agency of Indonesia.
In the 1938 tsunami in Dongala, more than 200 people lost their lives and thousands of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami hit western Dongala again in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific and is a regular target of earthquakes.
These are the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of Aceh's population.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people lost their lives on Nyas Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Zaparna Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and triggered a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hit the Pedijay Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily without a place to stay.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, a 29-year-old from Vasile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took away her phone.
Palin has been detained in Mats and is on $500 bail, according to KTUU.
On Saturday, he appeared in court where he said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A violations, meaning he could face a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that arose from the Iraq war.
Tsunami caused by earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit only central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rented truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October and mow down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in New York's Southern District.
According to the court document, both points carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges that included eight counts of murder along with racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt."
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laur Ducat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferucio, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panuccio.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
The indictment alleges that Saipov told authorities that he was incited to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he also asked for ISIS flags to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Peton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession along with life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Peton said.
Saip’s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be in Charge of Brexit Talks
Nigel Farage promised during a protest at a Conservative Party conference on Monday that he would “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former UKIP leader said politicians should face Euroscepticism – as one of Parliamentarian Theresa May has suggested, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have “already come out” by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her divided ranks is highlighted by the views of the Conservatives, who are in favour of staying and joining a separate city protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to follow Chequers’ compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
The allies insist on continuing to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction – and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offer and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone stated at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "throw away the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made equal and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If I was responsible, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers.”
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative MP and Brexit supporter, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who actually take to the streets and put us first.
Play Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the crowd that politicians must face problems if they decide to issue a decision that was made in a 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we will not let them get away with this.’
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to delivering Brexit, to feel the coming tide.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has won the Brexit victory and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the Remains walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Crowds of activists waved the banners “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, the Labour leader, mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for a ‘Canada plus plus’ solution, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce."
A good Brexit, it doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren Plans to Consider Entering the Race for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider entering the race for president" well after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future in a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Deal, a Republican who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There has been speculation that Warren could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
Some participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to head to Washington to recover the shaken government, and that includes the woman at the top.”
Arrested suspect who shot at Sims, LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, said on Saturday they had arrested the suspect who shot and killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, age 20, at 11:00 ET at a conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head and died instantly,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media via channel 247sports.
Wade stood up for his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present, owning a gun, and killing Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 198.12 cm tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Walter Bottas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team would play a big role in this race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack his colleague.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton running into a crowd at the end of the lane, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes moved later and came out ahead of Vettel, but Hamilton overtook the wheel after the ride, leaving Ferrari's driver involuntarily in danger of pulling away after a double defensive move on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race to achieve a quick finish and took Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He went into boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen remained in fourth place.
This is a tough day because Valtteri has been driving great all weekend and like a real gentleman missed me.
The team did a great job of winning the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil, rude and dishonest."
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, rude and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the posts and the leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release that to the public?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public – “Oh, please, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we announce it... No, we didn’t,” he added, referring to the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September. Feinstein rejected the claim that the information had been leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep the story confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked.”
But her denial didn’t seem to appeal to the president, who during a rally on Saturday night commented: “You know what, that was just bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They have decided to return power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for losing the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants in a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an advantage from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought home the advantage before Dwyer reinstated the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals by Lucas Landvode Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keef, who came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist after Bowlier doubled the lead four minutes later.
At the time of the busy opening, Sullivan returned the advantage of playing on home soil at 13:10 before Matt Marquah assisted the draw by Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead in the first third when he scored a second goal at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard equalized with an excellent goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and ensured his team's victory in the fifth half of the final half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people on plane from earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after allowing a plane carrying hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many went missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong blows continue to shake the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower that collapsed at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in the city of Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sire, said the decision made by Antonis may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong was limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still under rubble, while many cannot be reached," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nagroho, said.
Waves reaching up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every moment an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what it will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the state army, “I am asking you to work around the clock to complete all rescue tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person has gone missing, having previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it had been unable to find a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find passengers.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water during an attempt to land at the airport on the island of Chuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in hospital on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying low.
"It's an extremely good thing," said Janes.
Janes said he and others managed to make their way through the water to the waist to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and yelled and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on repairs to the docks also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in the crashes of PNG-registered airliners over the past two decades, but none of them was Air Niugini.
Analyst shows the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors on Saturday concluded a retrial for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Raulet testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Raulet said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicts his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with a cell phone belonging to Chambers during a time period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because the truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show they only knew each other for seven days.
Raulet said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to make a closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to continue that day.
The High Breed: What is the consciousness-raising hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots – political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and restore the popularity of socio-political hip hop.
Artists such as Fujiz and Common became current in the UK again thanks to artists such as Akala and Louki.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A nanny in New York City sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that the nanny was “another black person.”
The couple deny that they are racist and equate the lawsuit with “extortion.”
Linzy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she learned that her new childcare provider, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman “disturbed” fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their current nanny, who is African-American, was not doing a good job and that she was expecting a Filipina instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid one day's work, and then was invited by Uber to take her home.
Morris is now suing the couple for dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month job he was originally supposed to do living in their home, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the claims that they were racist and said the termination of Morris’s employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent something she didn’t plan to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told The Post.
“But why would you put your children in the care of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, please.”
Identifying the lawsuit as “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in that condition?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly disavowed the couple on social media and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
In a newly revealed letter, we learn that Paddington book publishers were afraid that readers wouldn’t get attached to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before a small teddy bear inspired him to write this children's book, would have been optimistic even if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "at the same time bitter and sweet" after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she said her father was discreetly proud of his eventual success.
“He was that man and he didn’t brag,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, he felt like people had a child who achieved something: they were proud of him even though they didn’t actually do anything.
I think Paddington's success was pretty much seen as such.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Ned regularly called to say that the situation was very bad, that he did not expect to survive,” Ms. Eden-Laperus said.
“Then I got a call from Ned telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the drugs given to her by the doctors to keep her heart beating slowly stopped and the drugs left her system.
She died some time before that and this was actually the termination of the entire system.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Laperus, in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what hell she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I bowed my head and tears flowed down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but over the summer, I felt immense compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in Mourning Place Suicide Prevention Cards on Bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydia, said her son was a chef with great potential and an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room.”
However, he gave up his job before his death because “it was all dark.”
After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by his brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be some consequences."
Ms. Davis made the cards “to let people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t even look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to deal with it: “It leads to discord in the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI launches an investigation
“I thought that if we really got something similar to what he was looking for – a limited-time investigation and a limited-range investigation – maybe we could come to some kind of agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “falling apart” amid tight party pressure.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition came because of the timing.
We are only five weeks away from a midterm election on November 6th – if the Republicans go badly, as expected, they will be significantly weakened in their attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly called on the Senators and lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 representatives of the Republican Party and 49 representatives of the Democratic Party.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to reverse the decision and send him to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'falls' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors who defected to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, Park Byeong-seg said there were 1,127 defections last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross into because of the extremely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on delaying denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and in such conditions, there is no chance that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Breta Kavanaugh 'hysterical', says he's unfit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribunal festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t shake the impression that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were teenagers.
During the opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and his throat tightened as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on personality" orchestrated by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was perceived to have a bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to give an answer when asked if she would try to take Kavanaugh to court if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn’t be in the Supreme Court, he should be in the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade Act because he is considered a conservative judge.
During a subsequent hearing, Cavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful that is,” Pelosi said.
And women should be proud of it.
It’s justified criticism, months and years of being overwhelmed by anger, and she can’t get it out of her system without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a rare occurrence, do you?"
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive at a company who said she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that implied that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would say, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
That sounded great to me too.”
Tears are allowed as a vent for anger partly because people basically don’t understand them.
One of my strongest memories was when, in one of my previous jobs in an office that was mostly men, I once cried with indescribable anger, and I was caught by the neck by an older woman – a cold manager who I had always been a little afraid of – and dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they hit you like that.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-wedlock affair on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, the deeply frustrated Miss Schroeder realized there was no reason for her not to try her hand at entering the race for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign had already progressed, she ran out of funds and vowed not to enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
This battle was doomed to fail.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave a speech in which she said she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions—gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at a system that made it so difficult to raise money for targeted voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism—that her throat tightened.
“Someone would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of the way the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex would be my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial blows to the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is nowhere near over, the gap between the countries could be conducive to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing retaliated each time with the same measure, and the last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return the US to the same measure, and it does not appear that the world’s second-largest economy will change its stance any time soon.
For Washington to back down, it needs to bow to its demands, and public acceptance of US terms would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of a trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of an economic upswing in either country is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the regime in Syria would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financially supported the rebellion.
Europe takes another victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a 16.5–10.5 win over the US team at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States suffered its sixth consecutive defeat on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again with Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scoring the 14.5 points he needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who struggled for much of the tournament, threw the ball with a tee into the water on a par-3 shot at the 16th hole, handing the match to Francesca Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever won 5–0–0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit is outnumbered 5&4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, was beaten 2 and 1 by Ian Polter of England, to whom this may be the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran player who played in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European with the most tournament wins with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup again.
The team is the most important thing and I am happy that I was able to help,” said emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He passed the torch to fellow countryman John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 points in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, which was surpassed only by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to make good moves, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick commented on his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we almost reached Europe.
We've worked hard.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We have to bow.
We're outplayed."
