Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “look like muppets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - a member of the Parliament of Wales) for their name.
The problematic solution is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour member, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “rhymes Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers not from Wales: in Welsh twp means "dumb", and pwp - "duck".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Party of Wales, his organization as a whole “remained dissatisfied” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close in writing to the word Muppet (muppet).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a draft law on renaming, made the following statement: “The final decision on the names of the Members of the Assembly will, of course, remain with them”.
The Wales Governance Act of 2017 authorizes the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the option “Parliament of Wales” instead of “Assembly” found wide support among the local population.
As for the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee expressed a preference for the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the most public support.
The members of the Assembly seemed to offer other options, but it would not be easy for the Presiding Member, Elin Jones, to find a solution that would suit everyone.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the organization of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, residents of Macedonia will vote on renaming the country the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims on the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against its northern neighbor joining the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the country’s name is only the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Harlem parishes: the bells of St. Martin are forever silenced
“The elders in the area I spoke with said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“And now there is no other.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar ceased to be a kind of living room of the whole district, where they came regularly.”
But as far as churches are concerned, the funds raised from the sale of assets will be short-lived, no matter how much their leaders may hope.
On the site of the church, he added, there will be an apartment building, whose residents are unlikely to support the parishes preserved in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams said, “and this will bring the day closer when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black neighborhood: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was bought by a black parish located next door.
When St. Martin’s Church fell into the hands of the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping artery, where blacks were refused employment or promotion.
In 1939, the building suffered significant damage as a result of the fire, and during the restoration work, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carillon “the bells for the poor.”
But the expert, who tested the carillon in July, called it differently: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical tool.”
The expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of its kind, played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play on a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriwether, St. Martin's Church has not yet found a replacement.
The last few months around the church of St. Martin there was a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
A congregation of parishioners, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, appealed to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to shift the cost of the work” to a congregation of parishioners, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver, fishing for lobsters
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with friends and after about half an hour heard the cries of the boy for help. Together with friends, they swam by boat to the site of the attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was loudly happy to catch the lobster, but quickly “understood that he was shouting ‘I’ve been bitten!
I was bitten!”
Approaching the diver, Hammel remarked that “he had completely torn the skin around his collarbone.”
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘Here’s a shark!’” says Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of Rady (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked the teenager is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles during a press briefing said that a few weeks ago a shark was seen in this place, but it was not classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities blocked the area from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to conquer the UK perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to install cosmetics and perfumery departments in Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with beautician consultants, modeled after luxury department stores.
The UK perfume and cosmetics market is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the fashion and home goods sector sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this coveted market as an experiment, 11 stores across the country will feature spacious cosmetics and perfume departments, and if successful next year they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves previously allocated for TVs, microwave ovens, home goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market seem to be a good solution.
According to Sainsbury’s representatives, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3 thousand items; including such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the brand line of Boutique Cosmetics products will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products to meet the needs of young buyers.
Two of Sainsbury’s stores will feature Fragrance Shop stalls, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in south London last week and the second is expected to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
E-commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products for every day in small shops near the house have led to the fact that supermarkets are forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury’s, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket chain is fighting for customers in a competitive battle with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury’s supermarkets house Argos outlets, and some of them now have Habitats stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to increased food sales and revenue from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was established between Sainsbury and Boots, but later disagreements arose between the participants regarding the division of income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of Sainsbury’s pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Selesio, the owner of the Lloyd’s Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of La Roche-Posay and Vichy skincare products in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more conducive environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of stores will attract a lot of visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a completely new concept of a shopping trip.”
Peter Jones 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The star of the show “Dragon’s den” Peter Jones “angry” with the exit of the TV presenter Holly Willoughby from the deal for 11 million pounds, which she expected to conclude with the lifestyle brand of Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with “Marx and Spencer” and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their co-branded homewear and accessories, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of the program “This morning” announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marx & Spencer and ITV angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den.
According to our sources, Jones was “angry” when a TV favorite at a tense meeting held Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after signing new contracts worth up to $1.5 million, she would not have enough time for their overall brand of Truly homewear and accessories.
Their brand was compared with the brainchild of actress Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and it was expected that its sales will double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million pounds.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram, Jones himself left the UK on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision led to the stupor of all participants in the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because there were only a few weeks left before the launch of the brand.
At Marlowe’s headquarters, there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading “This morning”, one of the most popular stars of the UK, can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as a potential delay in the launch of the line.
In addition, we are talking about the breakup of long-standing friendly relations.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for 10 years.
Willowby co-founded Truly with Tara Kapp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over the company’s board in March.
The two often spend vacations together, and Jones also owns a 40% stake in television production firm Dan Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We cannot comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiations, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that the media will bring to him because of the “unworthy president” comment and positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump dropped so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the leading news.
“I didn’t refuse anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in a reunion after Trump called their first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpiles.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho told world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday that North Korea was still waiting for an “appropriate response” from the United States following North Korea’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation with North Korea is great,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have borne fruit: was put an end to missile tests, the hostages were released and remaining on the territory of the DPRK, American servicemen also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange in his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Behaving like a president is so easy, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street rushing into this completely crowded room, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: recorded catastrophic destruction, the victims are in the hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that hit Lombok, foreign NGOs were told there was no need for their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost a roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, but we do not yet know whether the foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether it is appropriate to involve international organizations.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, no siren was included in Palu to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transportation between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously moored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims, is on its way to Palu, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s aging infrastructure a major focus of his election campaign and has spent countless funds on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko’s administration, which is running for a new term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for exacerbating the sectarian feud between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other crossbows.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea goal in the far upper corner of the goal
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and punched into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and found itself in the far upper corner of the net.
Goalkeeper Kep Arrisabaloga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with the LiverpoolFC.com website, Sturridge said: “It was all about being in that position and getting the ball, players like Shaq are always playing to the maximum to attack, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw Kante coming towards me, I took possession of the ball and, thinking for a short time, hit the goal.
According to the results of the first half of the match, the Chelsea team led with a score of 1-0, the goal in the 25th minute was scored by the Belgian Eden Hazard.
The central striker of Chelsea, passing the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, broke through the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played one touch.
Then he handed the pass over to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Hazard overtook the defense and struck from the left flank to bypass Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, striking the far corner of the net.

Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the National Disaster Management Authority said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people remain under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the official representative of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was littered with the wreckage of collapsed houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of causing fatal knife wounds to a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in the town of Birkenhead, Merseyside County, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Muse complex on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among local residents.
O’Hagen, the inspector of the criminal police, said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly ask anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead to observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something on the DVR. Please contact us with any information that may help the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found on the premises of the complex.
This afternoon, alleged familiar victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is under way and police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim's immediate family.
The taxi driver, who lives in the Grayson Muze complex, tried to enter his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he heard this, he lost the ability to speak.
Residents of the house were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One police officer told a resident that the entire surrounding area was considered to be the scene of the crime.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another remained outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to observe the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a personal message to <0x40>MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
A monument to Cromwell in front of the parliament building has sparked a fierce debate about the “rewriting of history”
Cromwell’s “expulsion” would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of a statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the opinions of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man who is still considered worthy of respect by many.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains a subject of debate among experts.
But it is safe to say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve high praise and respect.”
A Chinese farmer was killed by a killer pig.
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer became a victim of a pig, according to local media.
The bloodied body of the victim (the media only mentions his last name, “Yuan”) with a torn artery was found near a barn in the market in the Lupanshui district of Guizhou province in southern China. This was reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Xinying District, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered Yuan’s lifeless body, and the door to the neighboring pig farm was opened.
There was a huge hog in the pigsty with blood on the snout.
During the forensic examination, it was found that the pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” Wu, a relative of the victim, told Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate unit for the duration of the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan’s family is reportedly in talks with the market administration to compensate for the farmer’s death.
Cases of attacks of pigs on humans occur infrequently.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal nailed a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let go, only to be afraid of the ripened wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a "trigger".
Pigs are playful,
they are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just have to instill in your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rains to a significant part of the southwest of the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving through the zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring rains and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, located 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Baja California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rain is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, which fell into the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy showers are expected in the South-West in the coming days.
Precipitation of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity, the rate of precipitation can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwest of the United States, mainly in most of Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 5-10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapid floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Rainstorms can turn canyons into tumultuous rivers, and thunder can cause gusts of wind in places and raise clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, showers will fall in places on the coast of southern California.
Possible precipitation up to 1.5 cm, which can cause small mudflows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, tropical rains will take place in places that will spread to other territories by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the downpours will pass in the area of the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, there will be sharp temperature changes throughout the United States, due to the low air temperature in the Arctic at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be particularly noticeable in the central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern territories of the United States in early October, warm weather is expected, the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the space from the southern plains to the North-East of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with great probability an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing on the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was watched by more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaze Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six TV channels on Thursday.
The political confrontation over the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Flake put forward a condition that the charges against the lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she is “100 percent” sure that Kavanaugh intoxicated attacked her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, saying he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to the research agency Nielsen, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison, we are talking about the average audience watching the match of American football in the playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, were watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the case did not wane.
On Friday, a real drama took place with the participation of Jeff Flake.
After the Arizona senator, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Kavanaugh’s candidacy, CNN and CBS managed to capture on camera how Friday morning on the way to the meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake collided in the elevator with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him lower his eyes and receive a whiff of angry women on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one of them said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have power behind you, while so many women are powerless,” the woman tried to explain her position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at a committee meeting. The doors of the elevator closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake made one condition – to conduct an FBI investigation into these charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority sought.
Flake claims that he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Senator from the Democrats Chris Koons.
He made the final decision after talking to Koons and several other senators.
Flake’s decision had an effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians critical of her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published on the same page with an interview with May, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Chess” plan in the framework of Brexit, saying that he considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous”.
The death of Wade Sims in a shootout: police arrested Dytheon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of the forward of the University of Louisiana
Police have arrested a man suspected of murder in the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
Baton Rouge police said Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of the fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to the WAFB, a regional CBS channel, police found Simpson’s DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he fatally wounded Wade.
According to the publication Advocate, Simpson has a pledge in the amount of 350 thousand dollars.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary conclusion: the death was caused by a through combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Division, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local residents who assisted in the investigative activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at Louisiana State University, thanked law enforcement for their “good faith work in apprehending the criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played for the University of Louisiana team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and averaged 2.6 rebounds per game.
Team coach Will Wade issued a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Simms caused "shock" and "real grief" for all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
Volcano covered with ashes of Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano covered the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital with ash.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not approach the volcano: activity was recorded in its crater and 183 parogas emissions were produced per day.
According to the observations of the Center, near the volcano, thunder was often heard and trembling was felt.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users posted photos of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash.
After a 7.1Mw earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl volcano (or, for its own, "Don Goyo") has been an active volcano since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
Thousands of people gathered in Barcelona on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalonia’s withdrawal from Spain, which split the country into two camps. Clashes broke out between pro-independence supporters and police officers, and six protesters were detained.
Police pushed back independence protesters, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw eggs and powder paint at security guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police released batons to contain the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted: “We will not forget, we will not forgive!”, and their opponents answered them with the slogan: “Long live Spain!”.
According to local press reports, fourteen participants of the action were taken to the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government, but became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tension persists in the region striving for sovereignty.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to leave Spain, but turnout was low due to the fact that opponents of the exit mostly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block a referendum at polling stations in the country.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the declared path of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration took place anyway, but took a different route.
68-year-old electrician Narcisse Termes, who attended a rally of separatists in the company of his wife, complains that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming more and more unstable.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying with happiness, having the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent December local elections, the Catalan parties in favour of secession from Spain won a major victory, albeit by a small margin. However, this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a rally in support of the police, said the conflict was being fueled by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders who have been held in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was hit several times by a car; the men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were taken into custody.
The raid was made on Thursday around 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Crescent area.
The ram damaged the gate and the building itself, according to criminal police inspector Bob Blummings.
There are reports that a bow shot may have been fired at the car.
The victory of “Livingston” over the “Rangers” thanks to the goal of Menga
The first goal of Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the team "Livingston"
Thanks to the scored ball, Livingston won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's exact shot tied Gary Holt's team with Hibernian in the scoring table, where they tied for second place.
Gerrard's club was left without a victory on the road this season of the Premier League. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, the "Harts", from which the "Rangers" are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will hold a Europa League match with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
Livingston continue their unbeaten streak in the division, having already played six matches and not receiving a single defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as head coach of the team.
Missed moments for “Livingston” in a fight with assertive guests
Coach Holt’s wards had to keep score from the start – the “rangers” clearly could not cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not come out. Then the defender Alan Lithgow, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball of Cage Halkett to get into the net.
The host side allowed the Rangers to play out in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a pass to Menge, who scored from the central position.
By that time, the Rangers were superior in possession of the ball, but the defense of the host team was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to fend off a blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Ranger goaltender Allan McGregor kicked the ball away from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow made a wide serve from the standard position.
Balls were constantly hit in the penalty area of Livingston, but all attacks were repulsed, and two penalties – one for provoking backup player Glenn Middleton Halkett and the second for playing by hand – were not met.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingstone" - analysis
By BBC Scotland – Alasdair Lamont, report from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympus.
Their style of play and composition have remained virtually unchanged since their rise to the top of the rankings, and Coach Holt’s great merit is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a superbly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall from relaxing.
At the same time, the Rangers could not get into the rhythm.
Although they had good moments with coach Gerrard, this time they did not live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they lacked possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defense of the host team only once. The Rangers, who dropped to the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Erdogan’s cool reception during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine and the two top figures were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany to improve relations between the two NATO member states, a visit already fraught with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police did not allow the 25,000-strong crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan’s supporters were stationed nearby to see his president.
Opponents of Erdogan’s regime, including the Kurds, gathered in the same place to condemn both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Accident on the roads of Deptford: a collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, a car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of the town of Depfort, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was shot down by a car whose driver fled.
The London police report that work is currently underway to identify the deceased and notify his immediate family.
In the meantime, roads were blocked at the scene and the route of buses was changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Riots in Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured during the riots in the men ' s high-security prison.
In the men's prison of the strict regime Long-Lartin (Worcestershire) from Sunday continue the riots, which began around 09:30 local time.
To quell the riots involving eight prisoners from the same wing, the Tornado task force was called in.
The police suffered minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they were treated on the spot.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were involved in solving the incident in the Long-Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our facility, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their measure of restraint may be changed for a longer period of time.”
Long Lartin currently holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison’s leadership was forced to involve special-purpose units to calm the raging prisoners who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of the passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is "lucky": at the beginning of the next week, hurricane Rosa, making a final spurt, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of torrential floods.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of torrential flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over the Phoenix on Tuesday and rain down on Monday night.
The National Weather Service’s Bureau of Meteorology in Phoenix said on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation will fall, sometimes reaching 15 cm on the Arizona Mogollon-Rome plateau.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible that up to 2.5–5 cm of precipitation may fall, in some places precipitation can reach 10 cm.
For areas that will be bypassed by torrential rains, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although torrential floods can pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not pass in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought (the second worst category),” the website weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a top speed of 137 km/h, is located 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane was in the zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that in some areas of Mexico will be abundant rainfall with the threat of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora can fall up to 7-10 cm of precipitation, in some places up to 25 cm,” — reports the website weather.com.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning in the category of a tropical cyclone. From Arizona, it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its debris is associated with heavy rains in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the desert areas of the southwest of the United States,” the National Weather Service said.
Precipitation is expected to cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Arrested in Attempted Murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attack with serious injuries was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of the city of Midsomer Norton at about 4 am on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as "stable".
The same evening, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime, possessing any video footage of what happened on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the malice” of the Democrats has fallen on Kavanaugh”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics employed by the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
In Trump’s opinion, in the process of approving Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all the hatred, all the malice” of the Democratic Party collapsed.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress, in an emotional statement flatly rejecting the accusation of Christina Blaze Ford that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the U.S. president said that on that day, “the American people saw Kavanaugh’s brilliant intelligence, class, and courage.”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation is the vote for the approval of one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unblemished state record,” the president said in a statement to a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly touched on the issue of the nomination of Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the Republican turnout for the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important election of our lives is only five weeks away.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different sense,” he said.
“I’m wearing a tan and I’m fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all their might.”
According to the rules, the first key vote in the Senate on the approval of Kavanaugh’s candidacy should take place no later than Friday, said the assistant high-ranking representative of the Republican party.
Earthquake in Indonesia claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many carried away by giant waves that captured the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by the incredible force of the tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday, at sunset, waves almost six meters high overtook the coast, which swept everything in its path and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach holiday instead of immediately running to the shelter, and because of this lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Authority, during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come one thing, in the flow of water there were cars, logs, whole houses, the element destroyed everything in its path,” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and hit the coast with all its might.
Some of those present climbed the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photography of the disaster management department shows destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by tremors.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technologies of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) stated that the energy emission caused by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than in the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “massive,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of collapsed buildings were found the bodies of the dead; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even greater along the coast to 300 km from Palu, in a place called Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications from Dungala were "completely destroyed, no information was received".
“Over 300,000 people live in the Dungala area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, whose staff and volunteers have already made their way to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but this is not the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Authority was harshly criticized for failing to report the arrival of the tsunami in Palu in time. Authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, an amateur video appeared in which a man on the top floor of the building screams about the impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water collapses on the shore, taking with it whole houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major de-energization of the power lines, which caused communication to be lost in Palu. This made rescue operations of the services very difficult.
Military transport planes with humanitarian aid have been dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population is still short of food and essentials, government sources say.
The city’s airport was only open to humanitarian aid; it will be closed to other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the charity World Vision arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, on the way, they saw a terrifying picture of complete destruction.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to get into Palu.
Indonesian law allows for the attraction of funding, humanitarian aid and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the place where the disaster struck, a zone of national natural disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is believed to be a local disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Palu, friends and relatives of people who are missing, still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will return the population to faith in the best.
On Saturday, a young boy who fell into a sewer hatch was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to the lifeless body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian paragliding coach, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the Asian Games in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel included his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to get through,” he said.
Gandon recalls learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel from other paragliders, over the next hours he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Palu, vacationing at the beach festival, via WhatsApp.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray checkmark, rather than two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Stealing $26,750 at an ATM in Newport-on-Lyvy
On Friday morning, the attackers stole $26,750 from Brink’s cashier, which operates an ATM in the city of Newport-on-Lyvy, according to a Newport Police press release.
According to the investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex, and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, "an employee of Brink's ran from the back of the attacker" and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses, several suspects fled the scene, but police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Her
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will be a co-host instead of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, the author of the program reports.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only an abbreviated version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you,’ ‘you,’” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us.
First there was Kanye, which means “the only one,” and now I am just Ye, that is, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye wasn’t the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P Diddy or just Diddy, this year asked to call himself Love (“Love”) or Braza Love (“Brotherly Love” or “Brotherly Love”).
The rapper performing with West, Jay-Z, also changed the spelling of his name several times: with a hyphen and without, capital letters or lowercase.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against civilians in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking in Tlatelolco Square on Saturday, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed “never to enlist the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people. This happened against the background of the strengthening of left student movements in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador also pledged to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and the opening of more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for study lead young people directly into the criminal world.
US needs to double funding for AI development
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) should not be underestimated – the United States should double its investment in its scientific developments, according to Lee Kaifu, an investor and entrepreneur in the field of AI development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier statements about the work on AI were made by several US ministries, although in general the US does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Increasing the budget for AI research by half would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we’re looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI,” says Lee.
A doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Li told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in American Othello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects’ Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that is absorbing academic leaders, but corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring luminaries from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation allocates funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to create a national security Commission on artificial intelligence, for several months has not taken any measures in this direction.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor as a claim to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments struck an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will meet the 50 percent minimum needed to hold a referendum.
The question put to the referendum was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says Olivera Georgievska, 79, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of MPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it is not legally binding.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The State Election Commission said that by 13:00 there were no reports of violations.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says Yose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the issue of changing the country's name, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, placing chairs in front of tents set by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, not beating the thresholds of bureaucratic cabinets,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring investment to Macedonia, which is so necessary in this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the key to our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Studies found that between 30 percent and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, but that’s below the turnout required.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it turned out that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those polled said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to take place, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City bypasses Brighton’s defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dealt with the defense of Brighton, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it seemed that it did not make him any trouble.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton before breaking out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several more at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, being in the penalty area, in one touch returned the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot punched the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the goal.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero received the ball, being deep in the territory of Brighton.
He gave an excellent cut transmission on the left flank on Leroy San.
Sané made a few touches before handing Sterling over to the far bar.
The Sky Blues striker scored the ball into the goal just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City faced Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Cherzer is going to take the points from the “Colorado Rockies”
After the Washington Nationals dropped out of the battle for the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of one game of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, will begin to have problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7th or 8th place, but they still hope to secure the title in the first division.
“And while we’re playing just like that, at least we can hold our ground knowing the tremendous importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of spectators and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher for Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation tend to put Scherzer on this role.
Cherzer, who is about to go out for the 34th game, threw the ball at the pitcher’s court on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his day off, he will be a pitcher.
Washington’s right-hand pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding an election race in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the presidential candidate nominated to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very, very important. I do not run, although I do run everywhere, fighting for good candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we are witnessing meanness and abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to step over to get power and control, and that’s what they want — power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he argues, have set themselves the goal of “opposing and obstructing.”
“And you’ve been watching it for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil, vile, vile, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused loud calls from the room.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the contents of this document?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no. The body language gave it away, I’ve never seen the body language refute words so much.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organisation of different views.
They have no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of parliament from the Labour Party who has not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our opinion.
The same is true of my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she spoke out strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, a vote of no confidence criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice on the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the assemblies to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, GC’s Friday evening meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not match those of many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that differences of opinion are not allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more obvious, and every opinion is being judged on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions with which I would never agree – be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make a public statement, no matter what I say, there is a tirade of insults on social media, calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the centre’s policies, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments directed at me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist attacks but never back down.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that so much abuse has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “broad church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes already.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations urging me to sit quietly and speak less, and then I will be fine.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy outraged by the disparaging treatment of the Thatcher government, which has literally disintegrated my school class, I have striven to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most, whether it be the work of a local MP or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is so hard-pressed to move towards a Brexit that is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to reach is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of cancellation or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I see fit in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible "Er" comes out in first place
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Premier League Tennent.
Now they lead the table, the only unbeatable team of the dozen.
In the end, all thanks to their excellent defense, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci every right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” said Peter Merci.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth paying tribute to Air, they did better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazer Klimo brought Air forward, but a yellow card issued for the Warriors to the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to come forward, and Jason Baggott seized on the unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased the gap between the "Er" with the penalty, before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then in the break realized a single attempt, making a score of 17-5 in favor of "Er".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long hiatus due to the severe strained injury of Ruarid Knott, and after re-release, Air moved on thanks to Stafford McDowell's attempt by Klimo.
Acting Air Captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced the rivals to pay another player for the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of furious pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without the ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the advancing mall "Er".
Klimo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the very re-release, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme striker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the field owners.
The star of Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiran is going to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script for which he also writes, and is filmed together with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on this information, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan was planning to take part in a “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our sea”: landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are depicted with the slogan: “Our sea is right.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources is still alive; and the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again is vivid.
Those hopes may have been the boldest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a sense of balance, and of course they are looking forward to a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's claim that, after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who is waging a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, it will not change much.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to administer the Chilean territory and has already said it will not influence the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision was rendered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, but on the contrary has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, the bellicose rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Welce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court's decision was rendered too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the naval issue as a political trump card.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to step over our past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri argues that the dream that long-term U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is utopian.
Washington is wary of approving the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest line of massive headdresses that promise to go on sale in the mass market, and they will be worn right next to you
Whether you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun’s rays, there’s no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a lot of unusual hats, which are part of their SS19 collection and dazzled visitors of Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
Distinctive copy of Valentino: head beige outfit, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, adorned the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included gem-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but all of these hats are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these motley masks had their mouths sewn shut, and they looked more like a portrait of Hannibal Lecter than a creation of couture.
One of the specimens resembled scuba gear with a tube and protective glasses, and the other - melted ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, then you are in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to break into the mass sale - right to you.
The huge size hats follow the heels of “La Bomba”, a two-foot-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski was already wearing.
The cult label that released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such wide popularity in social networks, gave birth to and sent out another huge accessory to walk on the podium - a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model herself wearing a swimsuit, carrying this bag.
The orange bag made of burnt raffia with a white leather handle and edging from raffia became a bright copy of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will go on sale next summer. Since the designer has already made such a splash with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was confirmed once again in 2018: outstanding exam results demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland study, and where they strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you are appealing to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you are speaking to his heart.”
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relations with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams of this year, we see that languages occupy the leading positions in the league tables and have the highest score on the results of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received an “A” grade.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an "A" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an "A."
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacancies, 17 per cent had a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage — 15 percent of respondents say it.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a fairly large variety in terms of languages that are taught - each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach the languages considered most important to the UK in light of the country’s future development up to 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages continue to be vital for the country ' s future development, and this should be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits to Scotland’s youth.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The excruciating wait for fans to see LeBron James perform at the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be seen how much time he will have to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings for Trump next week, including visits to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his proposed Supreme Court nominee has been postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at a hearing this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the post of Supreme Court Justice. Trump's proposal of this candidacy caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was to be held in the Senate, will be postponed until the FBI for a week, while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this action is to help Republicans going to the November elections to increase the election pace.
So President Trump’s campaign is aimed at making these five meetings, which are set to take place next week, help “reinforce the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible as we enter a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.
Planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling action can attract supporters from “...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the media in Pittsburgh”, — reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the past month, as it is here that he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“The fact that Morrissey needs to be ahead of the competition in polls is not a good sign for Morrissey,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. national team shows willingness to fight and feeds hopes, going on Sunday to doubles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday’s two-for-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transitional initiative is an exceptional invented sports concept, but it is in it that players believe, and at such competitions it is especially pronounced.
Who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point lead and now four, so I think it’s a little bit of an initiative for us,” Jordan Spite said as he left.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve at stake.
Americans, in Spite’s opinion, feel the “wind in the sails,” and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least thanks to the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas playing together all day long, and each boasting three points out of four.
Sleep was unyielding from you to the green, which set a personal example.
The winning shouts became louder as his round continued, driving the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas lost two by two.
His blow, which gave them victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one of those that speak of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“It is necessary to gather with all your strength and focus only on your game,” said Spit.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go through 18 holes and become a winner.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spade and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are unquestionably in the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked four out of four, and it seems that they do not know the mistakes.
"Molywood" were the only couple who didn't dial the boggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the boggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series, and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the frantic fans, strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the “Le Golf National” field, there will be no more famous player who cemented the potential victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if they were both on the same page at the same time.
However, it is premature to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Norén.
The Boggies and the two double Boggies dug a hole in the first nine holes for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
It’s so exciting to watch the four-ball game and the four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange and who deliberately keep silent, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and made significant headway on the last day, but this quad session also showed that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday’s matches in four goals and fours with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score to “Le Golf National” to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn’s European team, eager to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the errant American team in the morning’s four-ball games, winning 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Ferik’s team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then perfectly united to defeat the fallen spirit Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Decembe with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday games, showed periodic glimmers, but now he lost 19 of 29 matches in four balls, and four in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning four-ball game, returned to teammate Henrik Stanson in the four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with a score of 2/1, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk refreshing day southwest of Paris.
Earned three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a landmark for Americans.
They scored a decisive 2/1 win over Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team come out four points behind, coming out alone, given that the Ferik team, as the hosts, had to play a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not “categorically” disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions have increased mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing not to build up stockpiles of nuclear weapons or develop nuclear technology.
“However, we do not observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able to unilaterally be the first to take action on disarmament.”
While Ri echoed the already-sounding North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for incremental steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start a movement toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must be done first,’ and raises the pressure level through sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, and even objects to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ree says.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, were a party to this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be at such an impasse.”
However, Ri’s tone was sharply different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “suicide bomber.”
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was not setting any timeline for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and without fail until we see complete, final and verifiable denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “gang demands.”
North Korea has vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile system as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, for its part, takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax on special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all elementary school students learn to sleep more and combat the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine consumption with the goal of staying awake “night after night.”
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
After his discovery, he came up with the idea of introducing such a course, having previously made a report on the impact of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘It’s a shame that I only found out about this now that I’m almost out of school.’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was found that students experience severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The lesson lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one section of the class, students are shown a room in a dormitory where, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books, they are given information about how each of these activities and substances – coffee, light, which cause lack of sleep – affect athletic performance, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants will learn about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages course participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health.”
According to him, a false sense of pride that a person can “smell all night” is still quite common, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a “secret weapon” of the student to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, causing it to constantly experience a feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler design the course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students set an alarm that warns them to go to bed and wake up, and to remember the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts a person’s biorhythm and leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng's goal brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers survived another sad away game, as the goal of Dolly Meng led the unassembled team of Stephen Gerrard to a defeat with a score of 1: 0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team had hoped to win their first away win after a 4–1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team scored only a second defeat to Gerrard out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the composition of the “Rangers”, who lost the strength of mind, it seems, was not going to even the score.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston are up to third place, second only to Hibernian in goal-scoring ratio.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after linear judge Kalum Spence had to heal a wound to the head after an object was thrown from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitutes in the team that went through the Air to the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Levi 11 strategy that widened the gap with Harts last week, and he’d be happy to see how his well-oiled squad squeezed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have taken the lead in possession of the sword, but Livingston were pushed a lot harder when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes, when Meng's first transfer to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs made a penalty kick against team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to send the ball towards the far bar.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he had to hit a penalty kick at the 45th minute when he and Stephen Lawless clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made only two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Coulibaly's head shot, and Ovi Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livy’s first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have corresponded to the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own work.
But again, the Rangers couldn’t handle Jacobs from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who was struggling to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began to act in a break when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately gave results when the extreme midfielder gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into their planned game involving Lithgow and Halkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Lithgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
The Rangers' backup player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty kick after he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity—an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film Coronado Bells, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans - who were seemingly unlike scientists - starring:
Man: “What kind of thing is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms generated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “I can hear you right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ abnormal cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the therapeutic effect of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
As a result of this change, the cells are able to “see” the type of protein characteristic of many types of cancer, then the cells must be reintroduced.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who was given the vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells has had ovarian cancer in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory, after which the altered cells can “see” the HER2 protein characteristic of many cancers, then the altered cells are re-injected into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland, says: “The results we’ve obtained suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted in taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to act on cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
Everything went wrong.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he would retake the post in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost City," which he wore a "Let's Make America Great Again" cap, the singer made a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“Very often I talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the title role, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment by Christina Blasey Ford.
There was no television coverage of how the crowd was outraged by West's remarks, but the video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West.
In addition, West complained to the public about the fact that his cap was ridiculed behind the scenes.
“They made fun of me behind the scenes.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “They also said my position wasn’t cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Put on a Superman coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments caught the attention of the audience at least twice, the cast of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication: “The whole studio is immersed in silence.”
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MANY.”
The talk show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (buying their music, clothing, or otherwise supporting their work) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, one can, of course, cite the performer who recently became a legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist previously known as "Prince" (Prince).
Attempted murder charge due to stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihakamor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, recently the 31-year-old actor strongly criticized the stereotype of the hero-macho, saying that such characters often inspire young people the idea that in order to be respected, you must necessarily be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he is “very indifferent” to this problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?” asks the actor.
“What are we teaching younger kids that we have a problem like this today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge of toxic masculinity due to overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, really, something is wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequels or sequels to "Game of Thrones" after the series ends next summer, saying that he was "over with the battles and the horses."
From November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s re-shoot of The True West, which tells the story of the film’s producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting Rose's wife is the best finale of "Game of Thrones" for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and a life to live,” he said.
Rose played Igrist, the subject of the passion of Keith John Snow's character in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, which indicates a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way was almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaks of Republican senators' guilt, complaining of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that one of her staffers posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the lawsuits were falsified by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing in a Senate committee on sexual harassment charges brought against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters’ office, and disclosed information about Waters’ employees, Hill reports.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent activities was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie.”
Waters’ statement immediately drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
There is no need to justify either.
And you shouldn't dig into the motives of the accusers, either.
We need to stay calm and cool.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
“If that’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In a statement, Waters said her office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent activities.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions, which can be devastating and dangerous to everyone and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again – a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which one way or another Britain appears; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise “Agent Johnny English”, the production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film “Agent Johnny English: Reboot”.
Will the self-irony picture with the leitmotif “obvious we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the rubber-faced, puffy-eyed Johnny English got his right to chaos for the second time—his name is the clearest hint that he is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematographic audience.
The hero, of course, is a dull secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to glamour smoothie, got a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean’s traits and a portion of this guy who made one single note to the Chariots of Fire tune in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the personality of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
In this latest issue of JE there are one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades were sliding down his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson’s gift for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such “serious” film rehearsals as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible” now confidently offer comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me Johnny English’s whimsical misadventures are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson’s jokes in the Mr. Bean films.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the on-duty agent - Kevin Eldon, unfortunately, got an episodic role here.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and assertive figure already suffering from huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the quasi-Therese-May character, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And then the clumsy Johnny English himself appears on the stage with his own person, who now works as a school teacher in some pontifical institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, since English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of “rock”.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former hapless friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, obeying the commander of the submarine - the role of "fun hockey sticks", in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game due to the fact that Her Majesty's Secret Service has made terrible mistakes. They are faced with a beautiful fatal woman Ofelia Bulletova performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems - the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxury Volta yacht; English generates a whole anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All these scenes, of course, are a cute and poignant fiction, but there is something very childish about all this.
Quite moderate things.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role truly commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of Britons to four days for a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week but get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers the savings gained from the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
The sources said that the idea “fits” into the economic agenda of the party and will help the population to side with the workers.
The trade union congress has approved a move to a four-day workweek so workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered party policy.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from the “faceless directors” and “speculators” of utility firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not get their full stake back, as the Labour government may make “calculations” based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy discuss whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham to see if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and this information came up, and I said, "Did you do this?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained unshaken.
“I am firmly committed to Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments comparable in strength to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I do know for sure: Brett strongly denied all of this,” Graham said.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses were also able to confirm these facts.
This story is 36 years old.
I didn’t see anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held Global Citizen Festival (Festival of citizens of the world) — an annual music event, which is attended by an impressive stellar lineup with no less impressive mission — the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year in a row, tens of thousands of people flock to the Central Park lawn as part of the Citizens of the World Festival, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to talk about the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which opened in 2012, is a follow-up to a global project to combat poverty led by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other meaningful actions aimed at helping raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuading fellow citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicticism” where people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Organizers of Global Citizen say more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival since 2011 by its supporters, which pursue many different goals.
Through these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds have directly helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children reach their full potential” promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district. This was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens participants.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a social injustice of undernutrition a thing of the past,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government had announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities designed to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organisers of Global citizen say: “It will be a long and difficult road on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monet – these are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, and its hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use Navy to ‘block’ Russian energy exports: Home Secretary
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that Washington could “if necessary” resort to the help of its navy to prevent Russian energy supplies from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blockaded so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
“Iran and Russia’s economic strategy is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “pony with one trick” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made in connection with the fact that the Trump administration has set a goal to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third country interferes in our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would carefully study the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that to happen, a woman is needed at the top,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren assessed the activities of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “leads this district in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we proceed to the vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Policy Studies, 58 percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population is more supportive of former Governor Dewal Patrick: 38 percent support his possible participation in the elections, and 48 percent are against.
Other well-known Democratic names that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin spoke about post-traumatic stress disorder Trak Palin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, who joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, returning home, is going through the same thing now as other family members experiencing PTSD and injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an eye-opener" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back already others, hardened, wondering whether the same respect for their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military that they have given to their country."
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, intervening in the violence and possession of a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, District of Columbia, support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits shelter for victims of flight or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and counties filed an analysis note Friday in Washington, D.C., from a court consultant on support for an asylum seeker contesting the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the “Grace v. Sessions” lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are members of a criminal group”, subjected her to ill-treatment, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing a large number of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court counsel said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that policies that bar immigrants from entering harm the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never meant to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save lives in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly difficult.
“It’s very difficult right now,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings the wounded.
“Clean water is in short supply.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, digging in wet things and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing strong tremors.
He cries, remembering how a powerful earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
“I think I was pushed into the rubble of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they are safe and all is well now.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘attacks’ carried out through ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after one of China’s official newspapers ran a four-page ad in a daily U.S. newspaper about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in the state of Iowa, making accusations against China in an attempt to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections. This accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China is coming.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, as a result of which they are leveling tariffs on imports from their countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling down on this bullying by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by paying for and placing ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could have learned about China’s worrisome economic policies, because the local media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He also added that one of China’s most famous newspapers had “tempted” to publish his article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: with the spread of Kavanaugh, Republicans repel women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay away and defend the candidacy of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this situation have escalated to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to that later,” Grant Rieer, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, wrote in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November Ahead!” in front of the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” non-partisan political scientist Stu Rotenberg said on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already escalated quite strongly, and this is true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Court candidate, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, this step could provoke a reaction.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat on the dock, it’s also about how Republicans handle it, how they treat her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe – Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more inclined to the side of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony accurately or likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh’s testimony accurately or likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh most likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data warehouses” or PODs.
It can contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal online data storage is that it is completely managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes, and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make drastic changes that would change all their business models overnight.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has been quite influential in the net neutrality debate.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Leucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The monument to this event was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin “in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns.”
He later threw himself into the line of fire and with “greatest courage” led the group forward, then threw a field gun with one hand, knocking down three of the unit’s soldiers.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that "he could hardly have done so heroically, but it humbles."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the virtue of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stayed up all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you were not allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six fights of the main program, the fights were broadcast all night live on the 5th channel of the UK television.
At 6 a.m., as Geghard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, British fans were stunned to see Peppa Pig on screens.
Some fans are not at all impressed, because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
A fan on Twitter called the change to a children’s cartoon “some sick joke.”
“There was a state order that said this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked why.
"Yes, Peppa Pig.
Bellator President Scott Cocker said they plan to put together a schedule so that in the future, fights can also be watched by viewers from the UK.
“As for the replay, I think we can solve this issue,” says Cocker.
“But it’s Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we can’t solve this issue until Sunday at our time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we will do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a bunch of text messages poured in, and all of them were far from friendly.
We immediately tried to solve this problem, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you that won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we are trying to increase this number, but it turned out to be too much.
Yeah, it didn’t go well.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling the worst about his sexuality, but that’s what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Lauren Laverne’s first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a child.
The permanent host of the long-term show Kirsty Young due to illness took a leave of absence for several months.
Daly, who played Laverne's main guest, said he felt "more insignificant than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He relates: “Until now, these feelings of insignificance and inappropriateness were quite real, but they gave me strength and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “meaning something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learned about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took him by surprise.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years his senior, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“If there’s so much going on in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer who would have the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to put up with the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was tickets to the front row of the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be there, and you’re not going to be able to sit in the front row there,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew it was something I’d been dreaming about all my life — diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, it didn’t feel any better,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song – Proud by Heather Small – which helped him prepare for the Olympics and is still so loved by him.

Michelson, who is not in uniform, spent this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to tighten his form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played at the biennial for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furick on Saturday for four goals and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as often happens in the United States, the five-time big winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the pitch in hopes of fixing what was bothering him.
Never having had the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the tough Le Golf National circuit, where a long reef usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself isn’t scary enough, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week, in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a bright start, the Michelson match can be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, though what else could he say.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He is a walking Hall of Famer and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that was the way it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michelson will break Nick Foldo’s record for most Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferik said his presence has been of great benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to tease people, and he’s a great guy to be interesting with,” he explained.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week and it was interesting to watch.
His game is much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavorable side.
The Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrame, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only slightly ahead with the smallest difference, winning with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjorn, captured in the photo, after watching the 2018 Class, winning at Le Golf National with a score of 5–6 on both Friday and Friday.
So history will prove to me and to the whole team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will be full.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as the glasses are not on the scoreboard, nothing is over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win a trophy, and that’s what you need to focus on.
“I have spoken with a firm focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know perfectly well what we are up against – against the greatest players in the world.
Satisfied with how his players performed on an inconvenient golf course for them, Bjorn added: "I would never surpass myself in this.
Tomorrow we will have another test.
Tomorrow will be the start of individual performances, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around your partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re testing all your strength as a professional golfer.
It is this idea that must inspire the players, so that tomorrow itself will be full.
Now the partner is left behind, and he must also make every effort.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that in the individual his players will perform better than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferik himself went through all this carousel in recent days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe held the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, rallied his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it faster, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we’ll try to do a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the standings.
“I chose this group of guys, and in that order, because I believe that in this way they will cover all possible shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost growth, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies – such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless when used in combat.
The software flaws were particularly critical, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the manpower on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to implement updates in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of keeping the newest frigates at anchor are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings of a reduction in German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy was effectively “running out of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said that the problem worsened over time because the old ships were decommissioned, but the ships were not provided to replace them.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could not be taken into service by the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in one of the estates of the Scottish Highlands, has the task of showing how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide a new perspective on the behavior of unique winged mammals and help in further conservation activities.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland, will examine common bats, soprano bats, as well as brown long-haired bats and night owls of Dobanton, inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes these results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of work on the management of the habitat, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forest areas in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development works that affect their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose hazards, as can fly duct tape, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat hunting.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat population issues very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, on-site inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at Threat Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten Scottish bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
“Here, in Threat, it’s a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He recalls the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within private holdings, as the unintentional destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation officer, calls on the public for help.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of their individual species live.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape allegations against him, calling them “fake news” and claiming that people just “want to proparate” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published the charges against the football player.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to speak about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video in which the footballer had 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner claims on camera.
“They just want to proparate using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that’s just part of their job.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine with me,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for what they called “unacceptable information about suspicions in the area of confidentiality,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player intends to seek compensation for "moral damages commensurate with the gravity of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy, but failed by one percent.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of being avenged” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience traumatic feelings as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer switched to Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret carmakers lost forever’
Business and Entrepreneurship Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would “regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clarke says.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a Brexit deal, supply chains will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line is launched “just in time”, and parts for custom-made cars are supplied by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store inventory at its Derbyshire plant for longer than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan, voiced in the Checkers, for a future relationship with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks”.
“We need a deal. We want to make a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers argue that we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production will be halted, but has warned in the longer term that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuwallaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s union, says members’ concerns are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we won’t be able to get them back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed to another week” as the battle for Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the post of Supreme Court Justice continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstructions to justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been a subject of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refutes this information.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House allegedly in order to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he “would have preferred not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a run-in with the Senate Judiciary Committee, at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints about Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, possibly this week, and it is possible that it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But we’ll see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings isn’t caused by “disdain for the community” of television reporters, though she added, “I’m not going to deny that they’re playing in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings answering questions from reporters than any other president before him,” she added, without giving the exact numbers: “We have those numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would still take place, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that’s much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, that’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House, participates in open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are rare.
The president’s frivolous and at times bizarre behavior in front of reporters gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why.
Health minister sends letter to EU workers in Scotland over Brexit concerns
The Health Minister appealed to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude on behalf of the whole country and to wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote the letter to employees less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of processing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and this autumn the expected decision should be made.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, right now I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury
Tennessee midfielder Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodore.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
“He went out to the side line and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for a medical examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury,” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, it was his first season with Tennessee State since moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before dropping out of the game, he successfully intercepted five goals, a total of 18 goals per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Under Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
This step will nullify the results of Corbyn's attempts to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in favour of the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move would nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more affordable and boost citizens’ incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional funds raised in this way should stimulate the government’s efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surcharge on the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to save up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are bought by non-British residents, leading to higher prices and making it more difficult for buyers purchasing their first home to improve their living conditions afterwards.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of bulldozing property prices by acquiring land but not actually using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to remedy Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent controls and an end to unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local governments more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I had dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that for non-UK citizens as well as for foreign companies, real estate acquisitions are as affordable as hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the threat of being out on the street for some is too real.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to run Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the resurgence of the North East club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross told Sportssound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden as a child, and it always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will appear only if I can become a successful manager of the club.
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick the Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he hasn’t been intimidated by such big names in such big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In terms of structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” says the coach.
“Bringing him there is not an easy task, but I will consider that I have coped with my task only if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, first becoming assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the following season brought St Mirren from the bottom positions to the championship winners.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I truly believed that management was more suited to me than the game.
It sounds strange, because I did everything well, made good money in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I still feel stress at work, but I feel good at the post of manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, in doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”

According to the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consulting firm that obtained the statistics, said: “Long-term solar activity, as well as longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs rose by 2.8%, and in restaurants, on the contrary, decreased significantly.”
June’s decline in restaurant sales by 1.8% continued also in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results comparable in restaurants.
Pubs that only sell food are also affected by the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out on the street just to miss a glass.
Beverage sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and food sales by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially as a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressures.
The long hot summer turned out to be more than ever impossible for operators working with food, and it is not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give a much-needed respite.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand rollbacks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring across the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data on 47 networks with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of “fake insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “core” account that their parents know about.
However, one in five children – some as young as 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — i.e. Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic, “clean” account that their parents have access to, but also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, stumbled across a teenager there who was urging others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles on social media, with half of them admitting that one of them is usually secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “Many teens are looking to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s an alarming fact.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” of the Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilee Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish athletics as a supervisory member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled athlete in athletics. Chairman Ian Beatty claims that this step is a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from the athlete’s extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Ailid is highly respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland,” Beatty said.
Doyle says: “I aspire to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as an ordinary commentator on the BBC, after suffering a stroke lost the ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost the ability to move.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was a grueling job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and today I perform dexterity exercises!
Thank you very much for your support!”
Advertising of a milk-sucker, in which nursing mothers were compared with cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
The milk-sucking company has sparked controversy online by posting an ad comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
Launching what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a promotional music video showing the freedom the new milk pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a haystack to a music track that says, “Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won’t see my tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a udder, it’s my chest.”
And then the choir: “We chase, we chase, we feed our babies with breast milk, we chase, we chase”.
This ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within a few days of birth,” one user writes.
Elvie's milk pump is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
And here’s another comment: “It’s clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But, yes, why not use them to promote breast milk for mothers who keep their babies?”
Another user adds, “Advertising detached from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song is “simply magnificent”.
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but it feels like it.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “Funny advertising designed for moms who breastfeed (often they do it right in their workplaces or in the toilets), and who, indeed, feel a little “cows.”
This ad is not to praise or scold our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with these inconspicuous milk pumps hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie milk pump is completely imperceptible, does not have wires or tubes, is freely placed in a bra for feeding, and at the same time is invisible, giving women the opportunity to move, keep babies and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Early Childhood Development Specialist at Mother, comments: “The Elvie milk pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
Drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring to the spotlight breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a humorous and fun way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new milk pump gives.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product for its intended purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children move unhindered to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to house children with guarantors.
Usually, most of the sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking the child under guarantee.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to be vouched for by unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously tried.
“About 80 percent of the persons who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners who committed the crime.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these individuals,” Olbens said.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules requiring some children to be brought to justice within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days as was previously the case.
To declare their legal status to an immigration judge, many are present via video link rather than in person.
Those deemed to be ineligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are intensifying in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to emotionally prepare for it or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders ‘occupation forces’ of US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Muallem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They should leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the crowd.
Muallem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been driven from their homes since 2011, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops to Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Muallem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prompted the refugees to stay outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel stronghold has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had a “clear timeline” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will be convened in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the commission’s work should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution,” and cautioned against meddling.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
And it will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue of the audience.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed cable’s ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our understanding,” says Neil Baer, the director of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovell, a long-published comedy writer and author of Just Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Getting Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, offers a different theory.
She recalls once taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Because it’s funny!”, says Ms. Scovell.
In all this chaos, there is something valuable: fun.
Of course, unlike all other content broadcast on television, the storylines on the events of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour in a row as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of the “deep background” for his book “Fear,” or about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (clothing insulated with pride), or about the harsh description of Stormy Daniels, as you usually write in the “Washington Post,” or about the harsh description of Stormy Daniels.
I’ll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of his job is to make us feel like the reality show is feeding you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily plot twists.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, at least not when showing Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and deciding the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

Outsiders’ money is pouring into the fiercest midterm elections the White House is running.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is receiving cash flow thanks to a change in congressional districts in which two officials compete for the same seat.
This suburban Pittsburgh area, whose geography was recently changed, supports Democrat Conor Lamb, a member of the House of Representatives, who won a seat in another district in a snap election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th congressional district, which substantially intersects with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that election fraud had ascribed old neighborhoods to Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement sparked a heated debate over campaign finance between the main party’s financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after winning by a small margin in the widely-watched March special congressional election in Pennsylvania’s 18th district.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. punishes El Salvador for supporting China, but then backs down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. His property was also in Panama, until the partners evicted the management team of the Trump organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Against the backdrop of regular domestic meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that should have been held to take stock of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward, effectively ending consideration of the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it in a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing with them any new tough messages or sanctions.
Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst who is part of the administration, but also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, as there is now very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also starting an investigation into whether there was collusion in Trump’s campaign with Russia and its attack in the last election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps ultimately to his fellow jurors.
But there are many “ifs”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d’état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do this, and this missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he proposed to make secret records about the activities of the president and speculated about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times’ data is wrong.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house I lived in many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later escorted me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic on the eve of a clash with the football club Viennese Rapid.
The Rangers will host the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take a strong position in the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making a 2–2 draw against Villarreal for the first time this season, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game thinking we could get something, but we went out with a draw.
Maybe in the end we could handle it, but overall the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough one, with everything to do with my injuries and the substitutions at the club, but now there’s a good factor here.
The composition is perfectly selected, and the guys really enjoy it; the training went to "hurray".
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to be taken care of, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don’t try to talk to them about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance.
And that's exactly what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for the fact that they will probably have to take care of you if you don’t make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed money life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insured with your own property provided you have the money.
Get your legal documents in order: save yourself from legal battles.
Make a power of attorney for medical care and appoint a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and make sure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend considering the possibility of drawing up a financial power of attorney.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you find yourself incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
In this case, will you be able to provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so that you are properly prepared just in case.
Martin adds: “It’s not just the availability of finances that matters, it’s the choice of doctors as well.”
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write down and write down the plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several times from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, abdomen and arm were hit by bullets, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. English summer time, as an "accident".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the failure of communications, rescuers can not get any information from Donggal, the area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (as of 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a district stretching along 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important to the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has devastated Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 occurred on one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervening in a situation where domestic violence took place, and for resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention facility and will be released on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unequivocal innocence.”
Palin faces three class-A petty crimes, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behavior as a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident appear on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to give the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York a rare death sentence
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight people and “deliberately” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two charges may be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a grand federal jury read Saipova a 22-count conviction that included eight counts of racketeering murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack was "carefully planned and deliberate", and Saipov carried it out in what they described as "disgusting, cruel and criminal ways".
Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuedco.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty for a criminal offense.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York was applied was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was glad that he did it.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital ward, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on Saipov’s side, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense has previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at a Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, as one member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have already “exited” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconciling her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that Tory members who oppose leaving the EU are joining a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan voiced in the Chequers at the height of attacks from Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "beat the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be levelled and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellington added: “I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat the Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Tori’s Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving reporters the following comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Chekers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular with members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and electing us in the first place.
Please put the Checkers aside and start listening to what you are being told.”
In a sharp appeal to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers stay in their jobs if they stay true to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they need to be made to “feel the heat.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them: ‘We will not let you get away with this.’”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel the heat.
“We will mobilise the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Tory against Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim they can set up Canada plus plus IT systems and technologies, to work on borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren Plans to “Carefully Study” the Possibilities of Taking Part in the Presidential Race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, says that after the November election, she will “carefully study the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There is talk that she has a chance to take the post of trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, this was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to ‘fix’ our broken government, and for that to happen there needs to be a woman up there.”
As a result of the murder of Simms (stuck), a LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which occurred on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 am English time at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who managed to be filmed.
The 20-year-old Sims was gunned down near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms received a gunshot wound to the head, resulting in his death,” Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The young man, 1m 82cm tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes team tactics will play a big role in the race.
Already from pole position, Bottas started well and practically hung on Hamilton, when he defended his position in the first two corners, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton stuck in the tail of the whole group - a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes left for a pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some struggle "wheel to wheel", rushed forward, which led to the fact that the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior space free, risking to get stuck after a double move to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap.
He then drove most of the race, holding on to his native tyres, with the goal of finishing quickly, pushing Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace on the remaining eight laps, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock,” said Hamilton.
Traitor's Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president made no direct reference to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were “vile, vile, and lying people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s going on in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it’s anger, it’s anger, it’s abomination, it’s lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer... did you “merge” the document’s information? — “what, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't.
All right, stop.
No, we did not “merge,” he added with the senator’s intonation.
In July, Feinstein sent a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t leak her information,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the allegations of the leak did not seem to please the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you: her body language has let her down.
She may not have “slipped,” but her body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend his candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They’re definitely trying to regain power in every way they can.
We see meanness, abomination, they don’t care who they offend, who they have to step over in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning the return match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of Dundee.
The Giants had an early two-goal advantage thanks to strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard evened Dundee's score before two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For Adam Keef's 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third loss of the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, when the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goal with the support of David Rutherford, after which Bouvier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the opening period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt assisted Coney in leveling the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored a second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the score, scoring a goal with a numerical advantage of 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the chance to take the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory, keeping rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games so far, are heading to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he deliberately went to his death to ensure that the plane with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing in a strong earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to destroy the area, many residents of the city of Palu were under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the frightfully swinging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu City.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia’s air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter could land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll from the quake could reach thousands, as access to the cities of Donggala, Shigi and Butong is limited, according to the disaster relief agency.
“The death toll is probably on the rise, as a large number of people are still under the rubble and many have never been able to get out,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, which on Sunday will host a mass burial of the dead.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Emergency ambulances bring in victims every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
The tragedy has already taken on quite a serious scale, but things can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s armed forces, in particular, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person has gone missing, while earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, it has no information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue the other passengers and crew of the plane after it fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline also said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane began to enter the runway too low.
“And that’s very good,” adds Janes.
Janes said that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was on the belt.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed on board, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the pier nearby also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they brought people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
Safety Network data shows that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution opened a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone records to paint an overall picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained the whereabouts of these people from multiple mobile phones; according to these records, Tellis was spending time with Chambers that night, which contradicts his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reports.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this became known, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had met Chambers two weeks before her death.
According to phone records, however, they were only called for one week.
Rowlett also revealed that some time after her death, Chambers Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale says.
The defence is due to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip-hop"?
A trio of hip hoppers are going to fight the negative attitude to this genre, filling their music with positive content.
Bristol-based group The High Breed argues that the content of hip-hop has changed, moving away from the original political and social issues.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues couple over racist text message
A New York City nanny sued a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black one,” which the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “purpose of extortion”.
Linsi Plasko-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern after learning that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, IT’S JUST NOT THAT, IT’S ANOTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent him miss Morris twice.
Realizing her mistake, “confused” Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying on the service that the nanny, who turned out to be African-American, did her job badly, and in general that they expected a Filipino woman, not an African-American woman, reports the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350-a-day dismissal for six months under the terms of the original oral agreement, which was, however, not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand that these things are unacceptable,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “And I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple disagree with the accusation of racism, and say that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, because, having offended her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racist,” her husband, Joe Plasco, told The Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were rude and didn’t want to?
Would you trust your newborn baby?
Oh, come on!’
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth just two months ago and found herself in “a very difficult situation.”
“And you are ready to pursue a person who finds himself in such a situation?
Not very nice on your part,” added a bank employee specializing in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t understand the move with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it is published.
It’s very funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children’s book about the bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, and would have reacted to the refusal to publish with optimism, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was “both joyful and bitter” because last year their author was gone.
As for Paddington himself, she refers to him as "a very important member of our family" and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained notoriety.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of it, even though he didn’t really consider that success his own merit.
I think that’s how he felt about Paddington’s success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperosa.
“Then he called again and said she would die within the next two minutes and that we had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.”
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, accepting the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“No one knew what was going on,” she said.
“My head dropped, I couldn’t stop crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of empathy for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he became depressed, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Lidney, says that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, it’s like the lights are on in the room.”
However, before his death, he left his job because he was going through a really scary time.”
It happened in 2014, and killed Tyler found his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I never cease to fear that there will be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards, “so that people know that there’s someone you can reach out to and tell everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t just sit around and be quiet, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she lived for 15 years - he died shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or upset or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he got especially sick: he didn’t even look at the kids when they opened their presents.”
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this, this event shocked our family.
It ripped her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and scope, we could bring a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “break up” amid a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if – as expected – things go badly for Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and elect him to the post of supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked for Mr. Bush in his time at the White House, and who, thanks to Bush, had met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh would be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to address the issue of equal suffrage and confirm his candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung Seug, citing data from the South Ministry, said that compared with 2,706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, last year this figure fell to 1,127 cases.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we do not have the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also not have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would have been immediately called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even bursting into a scream and choking, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an incumbent,” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with his allegations, as well as the way he’s attacking the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll put it this way: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh sided with the question of whether he would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and biased person into the office of Supreme Court Justice and at the same time exclaim, ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
And women should own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, she can't go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that unusual, do you?"
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a managerial position. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique by which she explained to her interlocutor: “You may think that I am crying because I am upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in a male-dominated office was that I once wept in fierce anger, but I was grabbed by the seam by an elderly woman, a soulless manager I had always dreaded, and dragged to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying because you’re angry.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they finally got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some frivolous intrigue and exited the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was already coming to an end, she was far behind in raising funds, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race if she did not collect $ 2 million.
It seemed like a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 each to men, offered her only 250.
“What am I to them, a priceless commodity, or what?” she wondered.
When she made the speech announcing that she would not be running an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she was choking.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls of how the press reacted to her.
“You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
“She was crying all the time?”
How a trade war with America could be beneficial for Beijing
Experts believe the first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, made the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all U.S. goods coming from China.
Beijing has retaliated by imposing tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods ranging from five to 10 percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the U.S. will be equivalent each time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to experience even the slightest difficulty in the near future.
Forcing Washington to back down means yielding to demands, but publicly yielding to the U.S. would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, U.S. trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to an economic tailwind in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept aid on any terms or from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 – 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-distance hit in the water on the 16th hole of par-3, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has won all his rounds, becoming the 1st to 4th players to ever walk 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spitt suffered a 5–4 defeat by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points per career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold out today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have the cup again.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2-1 in a singles game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this win – I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, trying in vain to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed golf of the highest class throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to hit Europe a little bit.
It didn't work out.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to know how to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news Concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, abundant flowering is reported, which indicates a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide stretches for approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinells to the southern counties of Lee.
Focal points can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to last week, their number has decreased significantly.
Red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations in and near Pinellas County were reported, ranging from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manati County and Sarasota County and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a possibility of respiratory irritation.
In northwest Florida, no such possibility was reported last week.
