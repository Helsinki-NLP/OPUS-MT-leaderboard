What will he do? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD doesn’t know Voldemort or the pastry shop in Prague
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD city councilors will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the parliament.
The daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has "tested" the members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they know the notoriously established slang, which was created at the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by its current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer in Prague politics," Culture Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said in response to a test of the "Kmotrov" dictionary.
And although he is a political veteran, Councilman Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you give me that I use sometimes."
"I generally don't recognize slang."
From the dictionary, whose expressions were published by the daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists had to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the candy store", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "blur".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who is to head the Prague school in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how the civic democrats play."
"I'm looking at how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he said.
As already reported, in the headline above, the councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize that he was talking about an influential businessman and friend of the exprimator Bém Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kautsky, and the only term he correctly guessed in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"That's Blanka's tunnel," says Kautsky, adding, "but I know it better from the newspaper."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole as the Blanka tunnel is then deciphered by the administration not only by matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the environmental councilor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plachym is also familiar with where to find this character - he senses the meaning of the expression "to go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague company," Shy is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
According to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he drew his knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test participants, there is no such well-established dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We rather call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and name contortions are used," says Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, chairman of the CSSD in Prague, whom the party calls Hulda.
"At school they called me Birch, but I don't know if my colleagues call me Birch," admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The journal Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and it works.
Councilor Weinert is for the party D<0xC4><0x9B>da or less friendly D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, the representative Miroslav Poche, who warned about fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the internal party speech.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> says he does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of baton law" recalls that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> received his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", issued a brochure
Women who are declared witches in Burkina Faso have several characteristics in common.
They belong to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example, for health reasons, they are free and do not have children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is very rare."
“Neither do young, healthy women, because they help at work and give birth to children,” describes a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, looks after more than a hundred women who have been evicted from their communities in a special home.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She published an information booklet to help limit the witch-hunt.
The thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard said.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
Ammy Hemmah, 72, died in neighbouring Ghana last week after being tortured, oiled and set on fire by three women and two men.
The BBC reported on the case.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, an oil was ignited on the woman, which is used for ritual anointing.
He reportedly set himself on fire after the group wanted to “drive the evil spirit out of the woman.”
Isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devourers of human souls have always been dangerous,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, in Gambia, the president himself participated last year.
“After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammi launched an extensive hunt for witches who were allegedly involved in her death and tried to use black magic to kill the president himself.”
“He called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help him, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the President’s personal bodyguards, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal's Tenant: Burning in the stoves, higher rent signed
An elderly man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Byty "uhlobarona" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a file under his arm and a new lease on three apartments: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is in prison.
All three of them have just been deregulated to raise rent.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for a 2+1 apartment of the second category from next year.
"And that's not hot water, and the petrama must be melted," the man points out with a finger in his son's new contract, which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms "irrelevant and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to act against them.
But the man just waved his hand.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that have a non-market lease in the Czech Republic are waiting.
In the meantime, I decided to visit the lab in person.
The Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov RPG waiting room is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at nine in the morning.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and an emergency caller.
"Rent 2011", lights up a special button on its touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already beeping on the big display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, it's your turn.
An older married couple comes to ask about the lease after a while, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not apply to new leases at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new leases in the Ostrava region are received by the tenants of the majority of the total of 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio from about mid-November.
RPG Flats in their letters suggests an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's just in the run-up," the employee answers behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces herself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal’s former mining flats are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of parliament and Ostrava native Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaorálek from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took it quite loudly, and even now the local newspaper is full of it.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change the toilet seat for me," said the man.
Most of the workers come to see if they will get a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as the RPG in the special offer promises them.
A half discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
The Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov "deregulation" partition, however, is definitely not overwhelmed with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the 2011 lease," the employee behind the counter estimated.
In doing so, RPGs on the web and on their boards propose to individually negotiate contracts where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG notes on its website.
"No one's going to be judged here," one of Byty's RPG employees thinks, and the man on the street outside the client center gives her a partial account.
“I have $13,000 in retirement and I have $5,000 left to eat, I don’t have the money to sue,” he said.
However, the workers soon become insecure.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
Rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to the RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach even the amount necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is the angry tenant who reproaches the neglect of the housing stock that is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the owners of the houses.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room repeats several red highlights.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% or less concerns 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the apartments of the RPG."
"And it will always be at most about 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," he will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will see a 38% increase in rent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," the RPG notes.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation will not drive out rents in leaps and bounds, but will be broken down into four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see the graph) the company will give back to the apartments, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority is given to people who sign a lease increase agreement.
There is also a kindergarten in the office, the architects understood.
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that she also hides a mini-schoolgirl with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
The architectural design company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings emerged, has been counting on space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly in the age of the baby boomer, and she wanted women designers and architects to be able to return to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of reduced working hours, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of a social program.
Thus, builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with child care.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to get a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (a grant of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and ensure qualified staff and operation for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to run the mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for a subsidy was significantly helped by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the nurse and the kindergarten teacher take care of the children all day, so children without age restrictions can go to kindergarten, but most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-college", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day, more of them are replaced.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and there are no stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens distant from the parents’ workplace.
In this way, parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship here.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors by Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
From the locals, the house, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s secession.
The front of the house is played out by dream lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
With detailed observation, geometricity, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order can be seen.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is even enhanced.
The winding and twisting of shapes equally occurs in interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and moldings.
Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia No. 43, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building an entirely new one, but soon accepted Gaudi’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
Many other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> started a successful collaboration between Jujol and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s Casa Milá and G<0xC3><0xBC>ell Park, which contains Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s other works.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname "House of Bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call it the "causing house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed for his time a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree slope.
When creating Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of that time and did not let himself be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, during the completion, the city council was appalled by the result and asked for correction.
The councillors, for example, objected to the fact that the building interfered with the pillar and the public sidewalk.
The correction never happened, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the call of the city district, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> applied for (and successfully obtained) a permit to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a lounge and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The entire six-storey house intersects the stairs, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon door, and a larger company can comfortably communicate with each other without maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction also received an unusual roofing and two additional floors.
Impressive is Gaudi’s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is lined with the inner courtyard, and skylights.
The play of two colors gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and luxurious apartment is made available to the public.
The owners decided for this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They insisted on the tours because they found that it was a very advantageous business and in addition, they expanded the tours to include common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum far exceeds the price of admission to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with one of the tenants and visit him directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the sumptuous frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying area, that is, the mattress and the grate, give the foundation to a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and grate are taken.
Typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages, where they do not heat regularly, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
However, it is necessary to rotate them regularly.
If they do not have a lot of vents in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, they retain moisture: mold could also appear under them.
It is also a matter of custom when choosing.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where a lot of high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn’t sleep here.”
"They needed a mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam on their battered shoulders, heels, and hips."
"These are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they poorly absorb 'information' from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's cool, suitable mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the heat absorbed, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing is forcing you, at night you will not roll over like after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to its height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at the double bed 90 cm, total therefore 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, a guildmaster of the Upholstery and Decorators Guild, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleeping and furniture ergonomics for many years and has been lecturing it at vocational schools.
For a double, each needs its own grid and mattress, but here be careful when buying to sweeten the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you will have no choice but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not succeed with each frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring frame of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the molding and budding layer.
"When you touch your hands or sit on a mattress, you should definitely not feel the springs," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-fledged beds, where the mattresses and the base are like fused Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) screen.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee.
But everything has its ales.
That’s why the advice from dealers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up hygiene and washable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although today mattress covers are commonly made with zippers around the perimeter, so after opening we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!), yet the manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when shooting could resemble a duel of light weight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grid?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for one night visits.
However, provide the board (if it does not already have them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (including Taschenfederkern) and a budding layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-positioning lamellae with 14 to 18 lamellae, latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable, but you always pay for the grids with a larger number of lamellae, 28 or more, where the lamellae in the thigh area are doubled and their stiffness can be adjusted.
Positioning slats do not include mattresses with a spring frame, because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special fastening of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slat so that the sleeper's shoulder is nicely "buried".
For men who have "shoulders all over their backs", definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers remember it, who in the "gentleman's" began to use the softening zone precisely in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate gratings with the so-called multi-torsion suspension.
The pressure is distributed to several points and the tension is reduced.
However, beware, as soon as you use the wrong pillow (large and "pumpy") on the right mattress and grate, most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and with the tips to reach only to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, it is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should align (along with the shoulder cradle grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original grass-filled straw mattresses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is also in the bio mattress.
Raw materials from oil, from which polyurethane foams are produced, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from hops and soybeans.
Soybean is used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of a material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh smell of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men "cool" the plant extract of birch, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women, on the contrary, the covers "melt".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favourites?
A mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, it is more breathable than ordinary polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining different stiffnesses of cold foam and "lazy" foam, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, thighs and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are taken as medical aids.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage.
Saving on the mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattress with memory foam Memory in the cover for 11 990 crowns.
The second one can be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density was started by Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload during the launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, on the contrary, it hardens in the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also for increasing comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, for example, on special pillows under the feet, which lighten the legs and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
Tracking devices want more and more parents to watch their children
Fear of owning a child leads more and more people to the idea of babysitting via GPS.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
The device is still about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can be as big as a watch.
A number of people were frightened by the case of the missing Anika and began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy happening," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases, such devices can be misused, for example, if they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"For the most part, customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is used and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns that if a child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose things when they don’t want to be under control.”
"High expectations were raised earlier by parents' mobile phones, which can be turned off in the same way as these tracking devices," Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková says.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child does not have any electronics with him that could reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
“When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will look for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising.”
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech from RC Monitoring, which offers surveillance services for both cars and people, even if the surveillance device is immediately destroyed after an attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to periodically send the position after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices have built-in tiltometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained motionless, the device will immediately send a warning with the location," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, a similar service can take even smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to match the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
They are always in danger of losing it.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, therefore, the device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"This will have the biggest advantage of not recognizing the surveillance device at all."
"Or he'll know them after a while, and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to keep track of cars.
It is a combination of location detection via GPS (which uses conventional autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would wrap the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometres of cords used to launch explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The army has a supply of 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the cords is two, maximum four years.
The army bought incendiary cords from STV Group, a.s. for CZK 40 million.
The General Staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary cords MF DNES wrote that the soldiers during the training consume 60 kilometers of lighters per year.
However, from the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, which the MF DNES addressed, it follows that then all generals, officers of the army command, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick, among others.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of lighters.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's reserves would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it were true that for the basic training of each new professional, a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord is enough, as experts say, the army has secured - even with increased consumption of engineers or special units - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years with fresh purchases.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondrova personally that they have almost no ammunition for small arms, so shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me that they buy so many lighters from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we try to accommodate as traders," says STV Group sales manager Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>ek said hundreds of kilometres of cords had been purchased and that the army would have stockpiled the "ammunition" for at least 10 years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from STV Group, however, talks only about the four-year lifespan of a lighter and police or army pyrotechnics even only about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be even the four of them," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to disclose his name because of criticism of the army.
After the service life has expired, each ammunition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not threaten the soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty kilometers," a spokesman for the Defense Ministry said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of the firing lines of the police pyrotechnics, which destroy ammunition from the Second World War or here after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order just enough to consume this ammunition before it reaches the end of its service life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and can also more flexibly acquire more modern, and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the two hundred thousandth Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech Republic, according to the pyrotechnicians, who were approached by MF DNES, faces the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which today "cheap" buys.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I have gained through the competition.
The winner of the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytlon sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of the last year’s Tradesman of the Year competition was twenty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a semi-detached house with five apartments.
That he was still a third-year student at the university at that time was very brave.
"At that time, the ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation with us did not give me to try to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All the profit was invested back into the house, which was gradually converted into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, over seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another one of the same quality was added to it.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisá, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says last year's number one entrepreneur.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel was largely due to the victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me additionally and I must say that it was pleasant,” she recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to everyone who is trying to do something.
There is no need to win, any visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not have had otherwise.
“I started trading with some of the people I met through the competition on a regular basis.”
The fame associated with success, according to him, fell somewhat on each employee.
He has about 70 of them.
“I see more loyalty and pride in them for participating in something that has gained universal recognition.”
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of good work by all of us together.”
"Only my name is in the foreground," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, due to the winner’s determination, Farmet has had worse times.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, won the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Firm of the Year competition at the Slavonic House.
The jury then appreciated the efforts through which he built a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions from a small toolmaking workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for the match with the competition,” said last year’s winner.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father a small workshop to rent as compensation for the confiscated property of the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked at that time, and with a few friends around his father they founded a company for plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the non-professional public after achieving success in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to perceive the Farmet brand much better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, Farmet was not just about the euphoria of victory.
The award was based on the company's economic results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis, which had not yet affected citizens so much, was at its peak, but companies were already halting their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, did not escape us either."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were layoffs," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
However, what they did not discount at Farmet is the investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre from the subsidies, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have won the main award in domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A Survey That Eliminates Nonsensical Regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is the fourth part of the business competition.
Some ridiculous rules have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year’s Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also available to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 votes cast.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, it will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register when checking with insurance payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová, a spokeswoman for the CSSA.
To highlight all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the senseless ones to cancel them is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the business competition organized by Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and it is increasingly popular among the public.
If last year about three thousand voters took part in the vote, this year there were almost four thousand.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there is still enough and enough.
"For example, in the number of tax-declaration lists, we are at the forefront in the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, business simplification has become the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the deadline for the competition is set.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "antique" and will have the public vote on it via the Internet during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year’s survey included more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition were, for example, the requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the happening, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted in this culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws entrepreneurs under the bus, so my goal is to abolish at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break meaningless rules doesn't sound empty-handed.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the Trade Licensing Office at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a stand to an exhibition or a pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trades Act.
The second most-voted duty in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office for up to 30 days for a foreign employee’s business trip, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of all the good.
In 2009, it became absurd to order physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two foot scales in the office.
This was eased this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell away.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
This year, the fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny competition is a novelty in the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the contest for the rebel of the year.
This year’s first edition of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 main competition has been attended by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity is diametrically different from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen national finalists was the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring disabled children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady takes care of its disabled employees, which has more than 70 percent of them, and therefore received the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region, and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for the fact that she prefers to buy from Czech manufacturers, supports civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administrations have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Managing Director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their pension supplementary insurance to its employees in the form of above-standard bonuses.
"With us, we make contributions for food, transport, training and recreation," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the company's competitors did not answer the question, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested during a public tender
Anti-corruption police have been arrested in the Land Fund building in Pilsen in recent days.
The detectives put handcuffs on a local businessman in the media sphere and real estate trader Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would attract specific interested parties.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for a crime of intrigue during a public contract and during a public tender," Antonie Zelená, head of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Pilsen, told Právo, adding that further details could not be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
Considering the minimum of official information, one can only speculate about how he could have influenced the public competition.
In response to a question from Práva, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>erná, a spokesperson for the Land Fund, said that police officers were indeed arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen, during a public tender.
"It was the client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public competition has the correct name "Call for tenders for land transfer rights under the Land Act" and takes place in the event that more than one eligible applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims under the call to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokesperson explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information about who had applied for the call, and since he himself is also an eligible person, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the land to those interested that they would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he collected severance pay for that.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He figured in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in substitution restitution, on which a decision was already made on the location of the building.
It was then that Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, namely in the place where the access road to the Borská Pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, it was very advantageously exchanged with the municipality for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to agree to this, because otherwise it would have endangered the building by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds of dollars a month.
Households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heat supply and rents will grow somewhere.
Families will have to withdraw hundreds of crowns more per month from their wallets from January than they do now.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay extra for water supplies, and in many places it will also increase the cost of central heat supplies.
The increase in the price of electricity should cost households a hundred crowns a year more than it does now.
The prices of power electricity have been reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
Although gas will become slightly more expensive, but at a time when people are drowning the most and thus have the highest consumption.
They also have to pay hundreds of crowns a year.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional CZK 50 per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay an additional CZK 1,000 per year.
Residents of Prague are at risk of getting more than 9 percent more water and sewerage costs if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Roasted will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still belong in the nationwide comparison among the lower ones.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage prices are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rents in 450 thousand apartments can increase significantly, where the regulation ends in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of rent, he intends to put the company on trial.
Regulated rents paid by people in about 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, especially a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks, after drinking them, most often end up in the care of doctors drunkards who are not yet fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated from the monkey repeatedly in the hospital.
This follows from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the income of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk with them.”
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, the head of the children's department at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Práva.
"If they manage to get the bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's whiskey, otherwise it's fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not feeling so much of it," the chief explained.
And the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, also gives him the truth.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovitz that they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the mayor of Pelican, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers on hospital admissions are a fairly common phenomenon.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years on pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring downed schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl who lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 ppm of extra blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the fairground in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice for a dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother didn't think it was strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the mayor said.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of the growing child drunkenness.
However, addiction in the true sense of the word can not be talked about in children, according to experts.
“The term alcoholic refers to a chronic addiction to alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, and this is not the case with children.”
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly are more likely to have a failed family and social background," Pelican said.
According to a spokeswoman, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol until mid-November this year.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children’s drunks who, after outpatient treatment, take their parents, or are brought home by the police, do not count.
Except when kids just sit down after school and drink a bottle of booze, according to Pelican, there are three seasonal swings you can count on: Halloween, New Year’s Eve, and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink up the grief of a bad report, or they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"I've seen seven child drunks at the same time on a witch's ward," said the Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in an advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose will run off the irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better off because they've had a good night's experience and a good wake-up call and nothing hurts."
"They're just confused about where they are," the Pelican admitted, adding that he sometimes spoils patients' moods by at least recounting the costs of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated directly to those children on the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to earn for one party," Pelican added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not approach recourse proceedings in which the costs of treatment would be collected from the parents in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of the total five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to Seville, Spain, where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer is located, on Tuesday.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for training or demonstration years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army and which was capable of flying.
The other three are single-seat L-159s.
They are still preserved in Aero Vodochody and the intermediary of the store - Omnipol - took them over last week.
According to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, it is not yet known when the planes will be physically dispatched from Vodochod.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the exchange were allocated from long-term stored aircraft, without additional deposits and investments from the ministry's department."
"The two-seat L-159T1 has been changed in its current state and form," Právu Peje<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft, because the ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns to convert four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to deploying the aircraft in some of the allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.”
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
According to the Spanish newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not write a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
The defense leadership of the time argued that in exchange they would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably also have a court hearing.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defense in the European Court of Justice because it had to choose aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is expected to arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within 14 days.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index finger than the ring finger are less likely to get prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60,” said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors, such as family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, and at the same time over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their index finger on their right hand shorter than their ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers.
However, for those who had a longer index finger than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men in their 60s it was as low as 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone supports the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences, told the Czech Press Agency that he was aware of the study, but did not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly tinged snow, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93rd km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars, and there is also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) told the news.
A truck crashed on the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided on the 93rd kilometer, the accident caused injuries.
A number of cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should descend just behind Brno on the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182nd kilometer on Kyvalka.
There are several kilometers of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a few centimeters of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created, for example, on Prosek, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
The Prague Crisis Staff is scheduled to meet again at 8 a.m.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech railways have already had to cancel seven express trains because of the snow.
For example, there are problems with the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday 11 am to 5 am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already driveable, but only with increased caution.
In the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov region, three adjacent roads are impassable, in the Brno region, snow tongues are formed in places, and in the Blanen region, snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in the higher places.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov region was one of the most affected places.
There are still closed roads: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To stretch them, you will need to put cutters.
When they will be passed, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution is necessary in the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained there only by inert sprinkles for the protection of nature, there is a five-centimeter layer of snow.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of snow fell, mostly in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snow in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The U.S. military has a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a little super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special cartridges of 25 mm caliber, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, actually act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and when the deadly rain of steel shards falls on it, it can knock it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for the infantry, which uses "smart" technology.
"A soldier basically treats it by finding a target, sending a laser beam to it to determine the distance, so he gets a specified target point, according to him, adjusts the direction and presses the tap."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon charges and fires the missile at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 new jobs will be created
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace in July next year from the existing office building at Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from their current office building in Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, a large administrative complex on Lyons Street in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to a spokesman for Fujist, another 100 jobs of the concern, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The lease offer was said to be very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park were said to be more suited to the working style of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only leased.
Bernd Wagner, a competent executive, said, “We found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure in Frankfurt-Niederrad.”
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region has brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), Frankfurt’s chief economic officer, said the move had earned him a “global player”.
It is said to be a "fantastic expression of confidence in this locality".
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, settling in is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed in time by the company’s management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the Marienbader square.
The result was decisive economic reasons.
Now it is a matter of avoiding a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus Square, which used Fujitsu until now, and the neighbouring "Kleine Verticale" together with the other buildings on Marienbader Square were among the most discussed construction projects of the spa town ten years ago.
Between the station and the town hall, the so-called urban entree was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer, which was criticized both for the massive development of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which at that time was still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Fujitsu-Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine and Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has the largest number of employees in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
The Astro Park office building has been leased 7000 square meters for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the starry floor plan, which is twenty years old, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry is also located.
Amazon shuts down its server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon has shut down a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was due to political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a disclosure platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed as wanted by Interpol, is to be held up according to one newspaper article in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
“Free speech in the land of the free,” activists said on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic cables to handle a large number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: “Fine – we’re going to spend our dollars now by hiring people in Europe.”
When Amazon has such problems with free speech, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after alleged collaborators of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted a search, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I used to wish Amazon would have taken this step sooner, given the earlier release of classified information on WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, outrageously, and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet,” he said in a statement.
“No responsible company – either American or foreign – should assist WikiLeaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the UK is staying, Scotland Yard reportedly knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there had been threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is why the founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the person responsible for posting on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television - ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "targeted aircraft".
Meanwhile, there was a verbal skirmish between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to step down if she was responsible for recent intelligence calls on diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we’re interested in one person’s opinion of a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now investigating the security of its databanks.
A deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed special envoy, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for the development of the “necessary structural reforms” that are needed following the release of the embassy’s reports on WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also said it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger by WikiLeaks.
“We did everything we could to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better time of year.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelati<0xC3><0xA8>re and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a little outdated ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooling box with a spatula, rubs it into the wafer and sells it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
If you want to learn more about ice cream, you can’t avoid the “Gelato-University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice cream maker set up an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines conform to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
We also offer several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in our own ice cream shop.
Someone in his Midlife-Crisis longs for a new career, others dare to the thin ice of his vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
Crucial is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there's a hint of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the tap on the machine and the pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream, flows out.
Immediately, the assistant professor is bombarded with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you experiment on yourself?
Luciano warns us to let ourselves be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Whoever speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" probably used stabilizers in the same way - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will eat all the ice grains.
Certain variations of the base material are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white base mass, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now he can take part in a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream – either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture correctly picks up the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano removes the device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemaker measures the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It is not only the device for the automatic production of basic matter that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into a cream and cools it to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we do not avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo gets himself and his colleagues dirty from top to bottom with fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of his control.
“In any course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it is only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Auditors in a double light
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts at Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech head Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have had a contract with the Ilsi Lobby Union for several years.
It is funded by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the control regulations of Efsa for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Thenn.
Efsa’s regulations are said to be consistent in whole paragraphs with Ilsi’s documents, and thus carry the manuscript of the industry, which should be checked by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed to a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa switched without allowances or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural concern Syngenta - and thereby changed sides.
The Central Germany Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU’s personnel link to the industrial lobby, which has aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot recognize the conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, that is, also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But he has to prove them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the US.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed them, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn in the field will do,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, how can they be found?" asked Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
She has been researching gentech since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected with the concerns.
Studies that are critical to society are usually not published.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck said.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he was standing in front of the train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the construction stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He took care of a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It blurs: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one cut, it smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen to the former ammunition dump of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man is dealing in old stones.
He bought all of them during the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground to a gravel pit or disappeared into a landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a watchtower.
He says he was bullied and threatened when in September it was reported in all the newspapers that he had bought the remains of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he was not responsible for the demolition at all.
And if this is already happening, then it is most reasonable to continue using the stones.
Then took about 200 S-21-opponents each one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it to the rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, the cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest have sold out long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from every corner and dragged what fit into the trunk and onto the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long been turned into "bricks" or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
“This stone isn’t really anything special,” says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political tug-of-war."
He gets into his off-road car and goes for a ride around his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, then biology, then computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
They collect their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-stone dealer in the republic.
It's stalling.
In the snow lies artistically worked sandstone.
"Once they belonged to the Marien-Bridge in Dresden," he says.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on the way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once the blocks belonged to the grandstand of Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported with simple hoists and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker, and one gardener settled in the forest above.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who evaluates the residues.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
Stones will also be saved.
Talent Battle for High-Potentials
There's a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students are pressing on the sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen automobile manufacturer invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: Recruit the most talented graduates in the classroom as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any success lists of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and acquire them.
At TU Braunschweig, the carmaker is trying to get talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department gives away pens, rubber teddy bears and plates with the VW logo.
He tells promising young talents about internships, student jobs and suggests ways to join the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both parties: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“VW can simultaneously get to know students, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be a good fit as a co-worker.”
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the new thing is that he fights so openly for the students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a technical project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a long line of applicants.
On the contrary, they must strive to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers (VDI), 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow even more.
The audit and consulting firm KPMG is led by Roman Dykta on the hunt for talent.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me will fly to the USA from many interested parties.
In the fight for High Potentials in universities, the laws will be more and more strict, according to the Dictation.
"We want to be different with our Race from the others."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dikta's talent hunter is in luck.
“We stayed in touch with all participants of the event last year.”
“Some of them will be graduating soon and are planning to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct outreach on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in the labor markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“Like on Intersolar,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of staff at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are listed on the company’s website.
"At the moment, it's difficult to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to practice or write a thesis in our country."
The solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
“Large corporations often can’t offer that,” says the head of St<0xC3><0xBC>be’s personnel department.
For a long time, money did not play a major role in the search for work.
Flexible working hours, taking care of children or good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors employee framework conditions.
The head of St<0xC3><0xBC>be’s personal department hopes the placement will earn her points among job seekers.
“I think that interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the Employer Branding Academy in Germany advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, that is, the promotion of the employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will themselves advertise to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing with a string,” says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Spills
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be built off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus finally canceled the earlier plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new wells are still prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
In the face of this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
They are trying to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar claims.
The commission of inquiry tasked by Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted a ban on drilling that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster through stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At the moment, the supervisory authority is fundamentally reforming, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will drastically reduce the volume of oil mined in the Gulf.
“The government’s plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the gas and oil industry,” according to a recent survey by BDO, a consulting firm, ahead of Wednesday’s drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make their living by stealing, corrupting, and illegally cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," reassures the journalist environmental activist: "Today you will get in front of the lens a lot of oil mud."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading up to his chest with water surrounded by smudges: the scene looks almost beautiful in a rainbow-colored water-gloss.
The fact that brown oil deposits float beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect enough garnels in containers here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetta River.
In the meantime, the slow-flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil poured into a huge moist area from the broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst-infested areas in the world.
On the way up the river through mangrove swamps with lots of side tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is only visible.
The motor on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of bright water, and whoever dips his hand in the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black licorice sticks, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain are we looking for the flocks of birds that are common in wet areas: As soon as the motor on the boat stops, it settles in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a spooky silence.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” laments Celestine Akpobari, “we live in constant fear for our health.”
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European conquerors arrived here, the first resistance was formed here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where Shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while daily extraction from the entire area of the delta is three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining wells and 7,000 kilometers of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni area lie idle, the situation for the concern is too unstable.
Every few hundred meters, the water rises out of the steel structure like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so the heads of the boreholes are called too gently.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty to death.
At any moment, such a head of a borehole breaks, Akpobari says, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have leaked into the ecosystem in the delta in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska in the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell says sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists say the cracking of drilling heads and leaky pipelines is the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the US-American scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: Only the number of failures on the lines is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck of oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by a line, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First, gasoline flows out of the line into the catch pot, then drips at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: “We will earn about 34,000 Naira” – about $ 22.
Residents of the delta are using chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from the “bunkers” who connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost every day in the entire area of the Niger Delta.
But only a negligible fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate over whether the catastrophe was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax way of production is considered by the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not considered intruders, and if they did not destroy the livelihoods of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refinery."
Meanwhile, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell in particular is so damaged that only the departure of the concern is taken into account: "Perhaps other nations will show themselves as Chinese as better."
Michael will be upset.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular producer.
"Soldiers could come at any moment."
If they are found by a special military unit, they are not in danger of imprisonment, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has got our land all the way to the bottom," Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the engines of the A380
The A380 obviously has a major security flaw.
Investigators discovered a possible construction error during a search of the machine that had landed in an emergency, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the engine manufacturer.
Qantas passengers were apparently more fortunate than previously known in an emergency landing at the beginning of November: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
A possible fault would have severe consequences: one oil connection could cause cracks due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement Thursday.
This could lead to a “catastrophic engine failure”.
These engines are manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has filed a statement of reasons with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce has blamed the oil fire for the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After an emergency landing, Qantas left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s on the ground temporarily.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National Snowfall Will Cause Chaos in Transportation
Germany all in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads, chaos reigns, trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire republic fell on Thursday night in freezing temperatures with snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
Up to 15 centimeters of snow lies in some places in the north and east.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in use, but could not handle the newly rolled snow.
In addition, there was a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm surge on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowstorms in Saxony have caused significant problems on motorways and state roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather centre, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland, the alert level for violets was the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds caused blizzards.
At night there were several trucks and cars.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities have reported major problems on the roads.
Wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion on the A2.
In Thuringia there were problems due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are great difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, inverted trees on the tracks or broken top lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Thuringia, Saalfeld had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers on the train received wool blankets, food and drink from firefighters and paramedics.
The snow was blowing across the road.
Many flights were cancelled at major German airports due to snowy winds.
According to a spokesman for the Flight Information Center, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
Frankfurt nach Main has already cancelled 40 flights, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although only a few passengers were left without connections at the airport, 400 field beds were prepared for them.
There were a number of accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a lorry at a railway crossing was also caught there, as the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning.
A 30-year-old woman died after turning over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light dust, and therefore will rise even with light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds with the strength of a whirlwind.
It's going to be a very cold winter - down to minus 15 degrees locally.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper article, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could be worth up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group seems to want the renovation costs back again - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, the Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
“We are still investigating whether it makes more sense to own or sell the property and then rent it again,” he said.
The largest credit institute in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of its own fund and subsequently refurbished them at a cost.
According to data, the energy reconstruction has swallowed up about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably make the bank a lot of money.
Experts in the field estimate, according to the newspaper text, the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" at a price of about 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the fund’s assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the death of miners
More than 10,000 people have commemorated buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It is still not possible to rescue the dead, because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but found no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts proceeded from the fact that the miners no longer have any chance of survival.
The dead have not yet been rescued.
Now the memory of the dead was honored by relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were built, including helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast on state government buildings.
NEW ZEALAND (Reuters) - New Zealand hoped the miners would come back to the surface from “the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told a commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can’t say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also took part in the commemoration.
During the November 19 explosion, British and South African miners were also swamped.
Rescuers began by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poisonous gases dissolve, the high temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is horror good for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to break through the old boundaries again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in large numbers with almost supernatural force - this sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even tears his enemies with anger.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters also utter at most one or two sentences or let themselves be drawn to the anguished dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and revels in the terrible beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It is good when the film has more target groups, it is only a pity when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his works either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality to an art audience.
Most of the fans of the art cinema seem to be discouraged by the splashing of brains and guts everywhere.
Fans of action films will get bored at the latest when the One-Eye travels to Jerusalem for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries on ships, and will remain hanging in the stillness and fog for eternity, before apparently the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
It’s no wonder that “Walhalla Rising” didn’t make it to the cinemas in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
It is a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the peculiar facade, sometimes even with blood clotted, there is an exciting cinema, which deserved a little attention.
In this film, it’s not about the dialogue or the exact plot, it’s all about the atmosphere, the fever dream that has become the film.
There is no escape for the spectator.
The Refn does not allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly strangles him with its chilling footage and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all, the indescribable hatred that bursts from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-Eyed keep something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero, whose motives will never be explained, who will become, in time, for enemies and transitional allies, a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It depicts destruction, perhaps only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued new warnings about Syria’s secret nuclear program.
But the country is resisting expression - and won't even allow control.
At around midnight on September 5–6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the bank of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), her name appears when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that diverts from the current.
According to a CIA report in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited for the production of plutonium — from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, it clarified where the reactor’s components might have been before they were destroyed, and was intended to be a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photographs were presented showing the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been launched shortly before, but without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than at that time, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but in fact had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence correspondents in Europe are even more cautious and only talk about the “alleged reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “credible.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of having a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The rubble of the allegedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen managed to find traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received through a member state satellite photos of commercial vendors from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more concise than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they are exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program and never built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But that was refuted by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, he banned the auditors from the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
“We will never comment on this,” said Ehud Olmert, the then prime minister.
The investigation into this case has thus dragged on fruitlessly since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - after all, it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three more facilities to be “in working contact” with the alleged reactor – and unlike them, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet indicated which devices are involved, what their function is, or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah, derived again from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It appears to be located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base, which is precisely why Syria rejects the IAEA’s access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called “fishing expedition” – that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the device by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence, as well as satellite images, that material was transported back and forth between these three locations and the square at Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said at least one of the rigs should be "in connection with fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium came from and where plutonium would later be cleaved into a bomb, there are only plausible estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris, which could hide important clues, is stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seemed to know where the debris had gotten to.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates lies the al-Tibni salt mine, which was inspected by Syria in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out ground work at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only this effort shows how great is the interest of auditors.
Damascus, meanwhile, has also rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were calming down that the reactor was destroyed, and therefore the thing is not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken about "the possibility that I am leaning towards in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This choice poses a great risk: On the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are clearly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in time of war
Since Angelina Jolie began working on the still-unnamed directorial debut in the summer, trouble has arisen.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but even this is causing unrest.
There has been persistent talk of the Muslim woman falling in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has since been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN organization to help the refugees of UNHCR Jolie and asked to meet with the actress, now reported the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN organization to help refugees.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization has recommended that the UN refugee agency release Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received her script for reading, allowed filming in Sarajevo after minor setbacks - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author emphasizes that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Because of its content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war began and they meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim woman, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which is really quite different than "a rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that the movie Jolie really begins before the war - is true.
Jolie says she is being pressured into doing something that is “not fair and based on false information.”
Now she can be freed by hackers from Hollywood: by illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
It's good for the Irish again tonight.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy at the sound of loud music, kicking their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, South Ireland, is boiling as players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups – and they hit each other.
“Beer pong” is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this squeaky beer game and reserved IT guy don't get along.
Nevertheless, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to relax from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan isn’t a gaming passion in Las Vegas, he’s going for an interview in New Zealand in January.
“It makes me feel so strange,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "immediately she got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Because of the poor prospects at home, two of the three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: As with the Tanners, it looks like it in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI Institute of Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin predict.
By 2015, there will be 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a fundamental loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of ascent, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, disaffection is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly disconcerting to the young, educated Irish, who have so far only seen an upswing.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone was in need, there was too much money.
Three out of ten men and women in their 30s are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: “Everything goes downhill in Ireland.”
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, they're going away, and our country is losing an entire generation."
"The last one, please turn it off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future as black because the government is only deceiving and offering young people no prospects for the future.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have any strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates drift from one unpaid practitioner to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject in a positive light.
McLarenon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
“For beginners in the labor market, working abroad is an excellent chance to make the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off a home loan.
“The situation is sometimes really a little crazy,” he says, as he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I’m basically not in at all.”
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked at the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not go well?
O’Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, “I don’t have any children to feed and I’m young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again.”
The civil engineer doesn't like the moaning he hears so often now.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells the story of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait for how life will develop elsewhere.
He’s also been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she's gonna flip out at the bachelor party.
"Emotions," he says, and he drinks a lot of beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can thus monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the periphery of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also grown in Mexico, where the economy has recovered from a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which pulls down the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trust the parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same figures as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis in Latin America undermined democracy.
The support came during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped to protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latinos living in poverty rose only marginally in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood changes across a wide spectrum from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and the state of violent crime has worsened.
It is only the second time since surveys began that more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but that’s down from 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, a percentage that rose from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there support private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chavez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections meant filling ballot boxes and repeated voting, ballots scattered across channels, broken polling stations, and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged forerunners, have been shouting that it is a fraud and calling for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of a violent nature, have spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that “in many ways it was a pretty good election.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is labelled by the election commission for having achieved a decisive battle.
Due to the raging cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Some 250,000 ID cards, which are necessary for voting, were left undistributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
On the tips to the center
In the weeks since her sudden widowhood, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, has benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 percent to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on the grieving Mrs Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
Everything will be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife had successfully become president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández’s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized when Mr Kirchner died of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, with the president having more space to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to be as high as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was suffering from economic collapse, prioritised growth and poverty reduction rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and purged INDEC, the statistical agency that followed official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to cut wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was boosted by rising world prices for Argentine agricultural exports.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on the Great Devaluation of 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is making it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure a debt Argentina failed to pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández faces an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes roughly $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be kept under the IMF’s watch, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer-price index that would resemble an introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term in office, when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of Argentines from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to quietly relinquish many of the views her husband has held in politics.
The Half-Incentive to China
Taiwan's voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, voted on November 27 for mayors and city councils in five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that dominate the mainland and have a strong foothold in business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma has passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with scantily clad girls.
There was even a mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien in the face, wounding him and killing the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates fought over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
The KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from inciting anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the reality and the realization that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, has confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue its commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait for it after the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, it was on the wrong level: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a troublemaker and a proponent of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has evolved that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her side represents a "trusted alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganize his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category
Speeches at the request of the President and the people must, of course, be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is hailed as one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Because Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album Esperanza was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in keeping with the Grammy rules that an artist may not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and nimble hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success, which in 2003 was recorded by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for voters in this Grammy category, who are looking for a similar work.
Elsewhere, the Grammy jurors rightly appreciate the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing run of the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against experienced saxophonist James Moody's album "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans-based hoarse favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise favored by albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
Wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge of steampunk won several well-deserved awards in the category of large ensembles, where the competition was chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Nominations for classical music at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win awards.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for Producer of the Year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Chicago Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project; and Synergy
In terms of the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kai Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Rodion of Encherin and the
Composers who have been nominated for Grammys for contemporary compositions include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called Los Angeles and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and the "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year’s nominees include Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duhon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition classics, soprano Jessy Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project, which promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people came to support this project — Christians, Jews, you name it,” Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It means that justice will always prevail."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against it only shout loudly."
"We have some really great people in our valley."
Negotiations began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was taken up by discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
“America no longer exists,” one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had coexisted in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted more and more space than the storage space he rented with the filter system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in Mediterranean-style architecture will also have two minarets and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has possibilities beyond the main elements that have been considered so far and basic.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that this is some form of truly 'alien' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
“You’ll start to wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on the news published to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the find, has sparked widespread speculation on the internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to exploit other elements that drive biochemistry, and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the substitution of one element by another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accidental find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, it is very difficult for organisms to separate these elements."
"However, arsenic is so different that it does not work as well as phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFOJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but because they can also survive with arsenic replacement, there is an increasing possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that earlier life forms might have used it.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel have been found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said Thursday.
Four show dogs — two Akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis — went missing on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were found late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area police department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their whereabouts.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not reached to comment on the case.
They were overjoyed when their two Akitas found themselves in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog named Trace and a 10-month-old female named Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds that were scheduled to participate this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions, scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop away from the couple’s nearly month-long dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - a boxer's puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a brittany hound - who remained with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who takes them to the missing dogs, and the dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the awards would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again now that the restructuring of MGM is getting final approval from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A New York federal insolvency judge on Thursday officially blessed a “pre-packaged” creditors’ plan to settle about $5 billion in debt and clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, MGM has no legal hurdles left to restart the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of the lean studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance MGM’s new operations and production.
Now it is about a connection with an investment bank, which itself needs $ 75 million, and financing is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co., an investment bank, was hired to advise management on how to resolve their finances, as management struggled to afford $300 million in interest payments per year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and the 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the $2 billion plus the financing required by the lenders.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board, and the MGM team began work on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper’s companies, which collect $375,000 per month for their services that run the company, will receive a reward for success, the so-called “success fee” of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has only released one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on the book The Hobbit with Warner Bros. Pictures.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beaded jumpers or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers — Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club — and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law was working; this year’s tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, than in previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys have appeared with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices shown are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their tummy.
At one press, the animal produces a tone, and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start to press, you cannot stop.
The best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animatric doll from Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk on the moon thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel lock.
The children are testing the Mickey Dance Instructor's toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn a car ride into fun with work with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you’re squinting after a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest, easy-to-use variant, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't have as effective a learning experience as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 year olds), Leapfrog's first major change to the Leapster series, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 year olds) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five dice that are no larger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in a row before time runs out; this is great for competing in improvised word formation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in the toy shops at the highest level.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle pet.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest in a line of button-operated microrobots.
The beetle moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun when you make a maze of cubes and watch to see if he can find his way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Introduction of finer police checks in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checking his orders and giving orders half-loudly with military authority.
He wanted the female members - China's stalwart enforcers of the city's order, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and fondness for violence - to convey a certain impression of the crowd around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, he whispers softly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as per ruler.
The four head covers fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said disdainfully.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has sought to revive the image of China’s urban watchdogs.
One city ordered the new recruits to have a college education.
Guangdong province has changed its grey-green uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
In central China, Wuhan replaced stare-in-the-eye with heavy weaponry: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers surrounded the snack cart relentlessly and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, an urban district with a population of 680,000 in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police force, who were selected specifically for their appearance, proportion and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also the softer, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into China’s secret urban groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat an uninvolved viewer to death after he used his cell phone to film how they were doing during a protest against a landfill.
Last year there was a training of police officers in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual, among other things, was a description of how to effectively beat the offender without signs of blood.
This year, a house melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
One violent video game that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, a national newspaper, lamented last year after another discussion on tactics.
On the paper was "a really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, the editorial of The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district required female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good physique and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Retiring at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is psychologically too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer told Rednet.com, a government-like website.
“Applicants must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city's management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both genders.
As well as the requirement for the symmetrical features of the face.
This means that the issue of good looks is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
A medical disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked man to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with apple-like faces and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her looks could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the alleys where they can do their business.
Every morning, the group faces off against more than a dozen marketers who run on foot or on bicycles and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times before!" said Miss Xu, as the marketeer began to run away, and for a time left his wheel with the noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than laborious.
“Every day is basically the same thing,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her spare time.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers of their male counterparts to confiscate goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors spread that police had killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where police officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
Police seized the motorcycle, which was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the car could cry any way he wanted.
15 minutes away in front of the police, looking furious, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's group, remained behind, his white badge turning to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
In contrast, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said materially.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts it."
Prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, the senator's lawyers said on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who was, until the time of the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" by the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
A senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there are no plans to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who claimed there was strong evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents published in the October 2009 New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews have been cited.
Since Hampton was until recently an assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was legally barred from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to be in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was released, “it turned out to be a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in defending clients being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid doubts over the indictment.
Federal prosecutors “clearly hid the guns,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that filed several complaints against Ensign.
“It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the law,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a call from the DOJ prosecutor on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the DOJ had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence team is working with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in Wednesday's statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments which he had submitted to the public prosecutors.
“I’m not comfortable sharing the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which an ethics group filed charges that Ensign’s parents’ payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant anything other than a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 email showed that after Mr. Hampton began to act as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "banged" at the Department of the Interior regarding the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the news of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of an investigation into the crime, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she said.
Cheshire's appeal goes viral on Twitter
There were half a dozen of them in the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they were sending messages about the horrific testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was scheduled to officially end with the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed an appeal with the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the process – including the widespread use of Twitter by mainstream reporters – created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with disturbing details then led the jury to make a decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, they should also require new rules in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Hayes’s chief counsel.
The trial’s judge, Jon C. Blue of the state’s top court, briefly rejected the claims regarding last week’s ruling, saying the media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence to suggest the jury acted under public influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in its ruling that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was due to the media’s “carnival atmosphere.”
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal, which reviewed Hayes’s verdict half a century later, might be surprised to find that new rules determining the manner of communication from the courtrooms might be necessary, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in highly watched cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was being practiced arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms could make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes’s lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Advocates also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudiced by Judge Blue’s refusal to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrific crime photos when choosing a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Advocates say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the most interest.
They said in an objection to last month’s verdict that the case dominated news in Connecticut and was discussed during the campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly fanning the flames of emotion about the case.
“The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters to court,” the lawyer wrote, “was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and may also be a national rarity.”
Their focus on the impact of Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports reported later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should control the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have demanded courts of appeal with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require court adjustments.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling on Dr. Sheppard’s case because of the breadth of the trial and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard versus Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome a precipice?
After a campaign that was notable for its insulting and negativism, a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not yield any major breakthroughs on the major issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of partisan struggle.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over several months has built mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
The two sides are now in a probationary period - probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the last two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, spending, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“It’s inevitable after the election.
The elections stirred up the emotions of the party members, and they then fell silent.
It's good."
On a number of issues, particularly those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, the likely compromise on unemployment benefits is only because Republicans cannot see how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed are denied unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on crucial issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
“After the things are done that need to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term,” he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely widespread - that politeness will lead to genuine cooperation.
“I look at all the events between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012,” he said.
The reasons are largely due to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of the tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan lines are clear in the initial reactions to the deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their view, to push the deficit issue to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the jury who suggest that in the case of financial issues, at least today, we have little basis or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the partisanship in the last election, most Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could be aimed at the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public’s reaction very closely.
Anyone at risk of losing votes is likely to change course and seek compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of the matter.
The partisanship and directionality is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there is a greater ideological divide between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than there was between the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would have been welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. documentary portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy” and it continues to be a part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in February’s records.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding the protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal transactions but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of the office” – will take its toll as the money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and have won several lawsuits for falsely accusing him of such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when asked about the proven evidence of corruption: “It’s crazy, it’s dirt, it’s dirt.”
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The Moscow city government and its association with criminal elements have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the report says.
“Criminal elements enjoy the so-called ‘krysha’ (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor’s Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics has identified a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Department of the Interior and Militia are on the second level."
"Finally, at the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an inefficient system where criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "shopkeepers in Moscow are aware that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), since they do not only have more weapons, resources and force than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their stores are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably loaded with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without the separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion annually.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. embassy report, which appeared in Moscow late in the evening, certainly did not arouse the enthusiasm of the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue about the solution of the problem.
Speaking to CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents released by WikiLeaks could have been forgeries and reacted angrily to the statement that US diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev’s Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it is about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves that Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the “butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished power, long-standing loyalty is also broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Khmer Rouge and its former soldiers to children for the first time.
And in July, together with the UN and the Cambodian court, to bring the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, the sentencing of the former leader, notoriously violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, there was growing unrest among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was beautiful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgic for the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, like unskilled farmers.
"These people have only benefited minimally from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were brought up with no idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
'That Mok has fed them all.'
"But life is hard now, because we have to do everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leading offenders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
There was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has centered on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge's rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project likely to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
Last night, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the arid grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had called her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned of instability if the court searches for other suspects, though experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer means gluing broken pieces together," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the Khmer Rouge government, 75 pages long and entitled "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education’s history textbook, which contains fewer than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, the path is overgrown with weeds and littered with discarded plastic bags, leading to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone salesman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit the Pol Pot resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to appear to have stockpiled uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that last spring they hit the rock of the accident.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that several covert operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was apparently a good move to secure an invitation to the former Soviet Republic for a follow-up summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all of their highly enriched uranium stockpiles.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and showed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is unsuitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,” which led to the deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
According to a joint statement, Belarus will seek to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's announcement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the foundation for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not do with the flights of the CIA expensive
The Spanish government has not been doing too much with regard to CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and al-Qaida members to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, as the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is also written that the then First Deputy Prime Minister, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show to the public that he had proper oversight of foreign aircraft".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication in which dozens of States, including Spain, were accused of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's statement had "taken Zapatero's government out of the picture" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with the flights of secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "overtaken unprepared," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
Foreign Minister Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos told the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government “wanted to give this matter the lowest possible outline, but that the matter being in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited options of influence.”
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information," the embassy explained after interviewing the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concern about "obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than declassifying information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of a luncheon with U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit," he had already instructed his co-workers to "avoid the tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech: Lidová strana - People's Party - transl.) in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
Confessed mother-murderer complained on the network about the maternity "care"
A young woman was talking about the baby when it was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she had been using from an early age, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the region of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan T<0xC3><0xBA>nez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they separated, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little boy stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma to visit her for a week.
However, from the content of her communication, it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca, writing, "Alberto is kind of upset that I went to work."
"When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes he has to be with the kid all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send your baby."
He complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving the baby with my mother, I’ll marry him when I get back.”
In May, he spoke of his return to his residence: "I will go there this week, but I will only stay until the 19th, because I have to go on the 20th for work, so as not to lose the place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
“He’ll be with who he’s supposed to be with, that is, me, and never again in my life will it happen that I’ll leave him with anyone but my mother,” a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When typing this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is pleased on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'm saving some money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he didn't know what videos he sent you on the e-mail, see how he likes it, meet me, sex is necessary."
On the thirtieth, another message: "The boy is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There is also a message about V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
On the Internet, M<0xC3><0xB3>nica's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she got herself called "Muki ex-prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything would happen because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered a provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, arriving from a detention centre in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how it happened and "didn't intend to hurt the little one in any way".
But before that, she confessed to drowning Cesar in a bathtub and putting his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the D.A. are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The people would have won four seats in the House, and the PSC would have lost nine seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP could have the main say in the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and the number of experienced deputies during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People’s Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually one.
In 2008, the Catalan people's party won 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections the number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if general elections were held, the PPC could get 12 deputies in the House compared to the existing 8, the party of the CiU (Convergencia and Uni<0xC3><0xB3>) would also get 4 votes to the Union.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (Left-wing Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - it now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would still have one mandate, or it would gain another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next stage will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist domination in the four provincial capitals, as well as on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euros for 2011 year.
Both nationalists and populists agree with the possibility that PSC could lose the city halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not win a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republicans' debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona parliament - as it needs to win at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes cast in the four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists believe they could play a major role in the Tarragona turnaround, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
People also gained in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell gives thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona in 2008, formed a Thai-run jihadist cell that arranged passports for various Al-Qaeda groups, including the "Tiger Liberation of Tamil Eelam" and the "Lashkar-e-Ta" group.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of the counterfeit Al-Qaeda apparatus at the international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand in the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then falsified and then delivered to groups that make up the al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their “fighters” could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active jihadist network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations, in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be excluded that in the coming days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junayd Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one developed in Thailand, with the Emirate of Atharung and the Emirate of Athar.
It was these men who ran the Bangkok cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, has been stealing passports that met Islamist demands from tourists in particular.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45 years, they had to be valid for several years and be without marked visas.
The investigative documents emphasize that no facts are known to link the Catalan detainees to the Mumbai bombing, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "invested" in the purchase of cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People’s Party (PP) demands that the Mass stop the fiscal agreement
Alicia Sánchezová-Camachová, president of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) party, had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Masa her conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and abandon risky enterprises as risky enterprises.
The president of the Catalan People's Party came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to abstain from voting on his appointment to the office.
The future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when the general elections are held depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but so far the talks he is having these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to win her support for her inauguration, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberating speeches," as well as to an economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that the CIU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
The two leaders would like to slim down the bloated political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass’s inauguration will be discussed within the PP party Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur due to a "lack of measures"
Olot Center Performances Don't Rule Out That Their Caregiver Killed More Than 11 Clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) geriatric centre gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage done to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of this home for the elderly, Joan Sala, accompanied by a lawyer of the facility, Joan Canada, announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the murder, but "the lawfulness and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the reputational damage that this institution may suffer for failing to detect the caregiver’s criminal activities in a timely manner, the great threat to La Caritat’s home is now the demands for material compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the survivors’ families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of clients of the home for the elderly with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor had personally examined the dead, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
Yesterday, La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme, stressing that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s attorney added that “in the case, there is no indication that any third party other than the accused himself has committed a misdemeanor.”
The man, now known as the “Angel of Death,” confessed to 11 murders on Tuesday, saying he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed a second elderly woman a month and a half later.
in this case, he caused death by administering too high a dose of insulin, in contrast to the first case when he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
The director of La Caritat said that it is difficult to control the access of staff to medicines.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably six out of nine used by the caregiver to kill patients in an effort to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila did not lie and actually sought a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by filing a lye, as he had already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
At La Caritat, they do not believe the medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he has confessed to, and justify their behavior in the various versions that Vila filed with the court, knowing that they must change their behavior when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That’s why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full extent of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday's threat from European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The marginal differentials closed in force and shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to err - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose his worries.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take liquidity back today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy back the state debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline, and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity ratio to forecast "at least until March" and to adhere to a three-month open-ended bid until the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations created, they will re-create the reaction of yesterday’s markets, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw liquidity, God be with us!
The same thing happened at a convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armoured fist announced on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many of them, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's auction of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in market sentiment that followed Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures were released representing the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get the new budget approved by parliament and still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the next summit meeting of the EU on 14 December, at which a political compromise needs to be reached that would show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures – this sounds to investors like the Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, that is, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
In contrast to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be in high demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we do not need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times as much as in March - and high rates and market access would close the sine die for us.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not only to be, but also to seem".
We can do this.
President of the Eulen Group attacks Vega Sicilia's actions requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the family of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not subside.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the group’s founder, comes under attack after taking it for “completely insignificant”, the legal action of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month and demanded five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to enforce their majority and seize, with the help of the administrative authorities, the Bodegas Vega Sicilia prosecutor’s office.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over control of a part of society.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to abate his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
Five of its seven descendants, who were appointed as leaders during the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, have been removed from its administrative committee.
The trial of the El Enebro group, scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, restored thunder in the womb of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
An appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s Mezquirizs is seen by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as “a desperate means of his five children to serve by means of judicial sleight of hand and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which was completely invalid.”
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this conduct as "completely irrelevant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the court convene a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, the group owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez own 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group claims the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge at the hearing of the question of judicial challenge of the hearing.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in the vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newly arrived team very seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone bet on the triumph of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without wishing to downplay the riding abilities of champion Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend has been born in the world of Formula 1 – the “secret weapon” that multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched on the market in 2007 for purposes very distant to motor sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants, and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Industrial Division at Siemens, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to make “in a matter of hours, in almost real time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyze and design each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Siemens head explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
The changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capability is the amount of $40 million, which represents the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and build its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is, without a doubt, the new champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immense technological means that the energy drinks brand has invested in its participation in the race circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey says that five years ago, it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory, with the rest coming from drivers.
At present, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while the pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores in partnership with local distributors within two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes, opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
It will be the first of a network of 20 80- to 100-m2 stores that the multinational plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrera, Vice President of HP Spain, cited as an example the newly rebuilt Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a store in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to say where the stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the next places.
Herrer, who also runs HP’s HR systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with an exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in the provision of personnel for trades.
Helena Herrero denied that it would be a franchise and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, operating, after-sales service and even packaging".
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pilot pioneer program that aims to address potential problems with computer-based devices under warranty.
The online service is linked to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So we can solve problems in 10 minutes that otherwise can take up to two days.”
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contractual technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrerová.
Sabadell Bets on Stealing 1 Million Clients from Its Competitors in Three Years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s delegated board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts an end to passive warfare.
Nevertheless, it expects a reduction in interest rates, which it will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to reach one million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with a duration of three years.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public assistance in FROB, to gain market share by catching a million new private clients - or 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - since until now the Institute has rather pampered small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in terms of private clients is 3.5%, while in the case of corporate clients it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce the costs that the bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, set four years ago, although it was originally set for three years, but the market situation required an extension for another period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting hosted by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "difficult and very important year".
Indeed, he believes that the path out of the crisis in Spain "will be a long one".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that passive war – which lowers margins – is receding, the price of risk premiums that banks and savings banks pay for their issuances to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans."
“We haven’t closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high,” Guardiola said.
Banesto had already issued orders to its network on Thursday to cut long-term loans and raise differential prices – see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "now is to cut commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that "larger sizes will be required" in Spain.
"There will be no stone left on the stone next year," he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "significantly reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB may substitute the collection of funds on the market before the new capital measure.
After reassurances that Sabadell can survive temporary market closures, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but, unlike in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA Excludes Another Wave of Savings Bank Mergers
Yesterday, the CEO of CECA refused that there should be another wave of mergers of savings banks, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is carried out.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Corporations (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out the possibility of a new wave of such operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are conventions."
“Most of it is completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already done and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well on this issue,” the director said.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executive Officials of Aragon - note) Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the installments, which at one time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank", said.
“The transition from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not-so-happy views on the slowness of the process" that show a "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on time before the end of the year".
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and has “probably” also in the world, and attributed “lack of knowledge” to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, "we can be calm" regarding financial institutions and savings banks and the system, which has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spain's banking system had emerged very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero has proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control), the manager of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgadová, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let us say in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which alludes to the idea of adhering to the old traditions that a large part of the other members hold.
In the face of European resistance, there is speculation in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of these is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the brand - although now it may seem like a scifi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary austerity, fines for guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and to extend the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for spins now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission instigated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (fiscal austerity and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully prolonged the decision to save Greece.
Even then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear position when she called for the reform of the European Union's conventions so as to enable the rescue of a Member State and at the same time for private creditors to be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat lenient form, has been approved, and in the coming months we should be following the Union's reform process, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures now need to be taken, with which they seem to disagree too much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, in which rule-breaking states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare payment deferrals, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany suggests to us that we must take a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply do not tolerate another option based on receivables and build-up, with the huge balance-of-payments gaps that prevailed during Spain’s booming growth years.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not just a question of restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us until the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this as well, and his double statement (reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big business and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the way has opened up to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And it cannot be ruled out that leaving a eurozone full of not-so-serious countries is one of the options that can be considered.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The feints shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show wit, not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be written about whether this is or is not unsportsmanlike behavior, and whether, eventually, UEFA should punish both players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won) the appointed players one by one deliberately lost time at the moment when the foul was due to be played, in order to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in their group lead - and will be able, deprived of cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, the disciplinary committee of UEFA awarded coach José Mourinho a two-game penalty and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules that are unwritten but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team (which boasts nobility and honor in its anthem, and which has already fined its player for similar acts), and apparently also due to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
In any event, the debate is about whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts circumvent the law; they are indeed actions which respect the rules of sport, but whose meaning they seem to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what type of damage such actions do to the sports spirit.
One of the features of sports behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these features characterizing clean play is to avoid that players have an advantage over the opposing team due to their offense - which also did not happen here.
Thus, paradoxical to the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumvention of the law did not occur, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should have been as obvious as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and were happy to be punished.
Another question, however, is what advantage the guilty will have from their intentional wrongdoing.
Here it should be noted that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that in the current match will not achieve any benefit, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by this action, the players will receive a penalty, and move to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in the first round is enough to exclude.
So, as the rounds continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, well, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because these were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the transmission of instructions to provoke them from the leadership took place.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
The fight of offers for the organization of Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year’s calendar dictates an avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties come again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis have resulted in a struggle to gain clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the entrepreneurs and associations in this sector agree.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated requests on the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations for days at the top (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay their expenses at parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices at the limit of carrying capacity, according to the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurants does not dare to predict at the moment what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think it over before they make a reservation."
“They want to get out, but when it comes to pricing, they’re cautious,” he adds.
Shops will do well for those "who offer quality and good service at a good price," he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go one step down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
Surveys at various facilities show that the biggest push for booking requests is on the evening of December 17th.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with most requests for spending up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30, driven by the menus offered, whose total prices range from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30.
In another major company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought more early bookings since the beginning of November.
“We have done the possible and the impossible to maintain last year’s prices, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.95 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30,” they said.
In the AN Grupa group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic, having recorded an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have a fairly solid prospect of Christmas sales.
Sources of the company emphasize that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 or more, as they noted a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava.
They also noted that there are already companies that are again inviting their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
The vice president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings has “revived”, although clients are “contracting to the maximum”.
This impression did not subside even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program sparks unrest in U.S.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington arouses.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer about the content of communication and the ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on the retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more than any nuclear weapons".
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that its weapons are not assembled but stored in pieces to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for Washington’s vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory controlled by the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and posing reason to be on the alert.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strict religious faith to protect its nuclear facilities; due to the decline in its level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile programs," Yuri Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest novelty of the documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the topics of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unresponsive or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asked Washington to “make it very clear” during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that “the Pakistani military must end its silent support for terrorist groups.”
The Hunt for the Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior official in charge of counterterrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red alert" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced an “extraordinary challenge” yesterday, the so-called red notice, to “localize and monitor the movement” of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens’ attorney assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on November 20, when an international police force based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange “with the aim of placing him in temporary detention and issuing him.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person subject to a red notice, many Member States, as the organisation explained, consider red notices to be a means of enabling arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assang should be held.
The move outraged Assenge’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks had shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin’s security.
“This is a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother defends her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations in violation of international conventions signed by the United States, she should step down,” he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the House of Commons from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations "so that it is possible to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Assange should be “killed,” which he subsequently had to call off.
"Obama should give him a reward or use a drone or something like that."
Who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Arkansas governor, and a possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for the leak, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he told Fox News.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s looking for peace in ERC by "mumbling" on Caroda's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote by secret ballot on its own continuance.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe for fighting several internal revolts in the ranks of the ERC (Left-wing Republican Party of Catalonia), to no avail due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to supporters of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carodo-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot cause him the same concern as he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to gain new critics with a wink that will help him to win the municipal elections.
First, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to make secret statements about his remaining in office.
Using ballots, not raising your hand.
If supporters of Carodo want to pass a criminal vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid division and submission of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half of the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Proponents of Carodo demand more from the president than to make his office available – a gesture they regard as of no importance, since Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the largest organ at the congresses.
But given that they do not have a majority enough to enforce the resignations, they will try to remind the plan from now until May by executive action.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document, which will be voted on by the leadership to the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>se in exchange for this promising move to Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that “multiple voices” were damaging stability and that his goal was for the organisation to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it seems to be a characteristic article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s’s ideologue, this innovation advisor took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed “in exchange for several goals.”
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is the "recomposition" of the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means that it also includes new faces who are from a sector sympathetic to Carod.
The second goal can be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely put an end to meetings as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates elected by vote.
Putting an end to the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, a convulsive assembly in 2008 decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party discouraged the resolution of this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to revisit this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a blow to the head, and her hands and feet were tied with rope.
The next day, the body was found in a trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early on Thursday morning, 4 November, co-workers discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in a stretch of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by the La Familia Michoacan criminal organization.
A day later, in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered by eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims, aged 30, were shot in the head in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc Colony, in Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found, and a 25-caliber cartridge was found under his body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue teams searched for other parts, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlan reported finding the body with its hands tied behind its back and its head wrapped around Pena Colorado's place.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In mid-month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was announced, and reports of death threats were also found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes Colony in Los Reyes La Paz County.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bedding in the Zoquiapan settlement of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, a man was found dead in a yellow-blue sheet in Huixquilucan, tentatively identified as Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to a report the killers left with his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with no signs of life with two wounds to the back of the neck.
On the skin of the woman was discovered tattoos of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy death" - transl.) and also necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in a car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their heads wrapped in tape, and a report was also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Among the victims, a report was written probably by one of the criminal organizations, which stated: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, bearing signs of torture and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n, and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied up with tape, and carrying a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a ticket with a message.
China has set a goal to reduce greenhouse gases.
The country's representative at the UN climate conference COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce the carbon footprint, and specified that he insists on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative to the UN climate conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this issue together with the international community.
He referred to the fact that China's strategy on climate change is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
On all these points, they have already made progress, including last year’s approval of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, various multi-year plans are in operation or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years and has received investments from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as the project of replacing fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to claim his rights from the National Commission of Order.
The National Chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been legislated and that the former chairman of this party was entitled to appeal to the National Order Commission and claim his right.
In an interview made before the objection was raised by the state’s governor, Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the expulsion of Espin was in any case a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Peace Commission."
“Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the National Council’s Order Commission in order to make a decision made by the competent authority,” he added.
He went on to explain that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held next December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
“This [2012 alliance] is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
The President of the PAS said that 71 years of dialogue are behind him, and therefore "internal competition does not scare us, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said that the committee could choose the best chairman or chairwoman it deserved for the next three years, so it would hand over the baton to "whom the committee will appoint".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, and I am proud to hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise that the party saw in the last elections in July would be reflected in future clans, although “there is still no time to think about 2012.”
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué on this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have their roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observations throughout the country, since "many expectations and aspirations have been placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to those expectations".
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party) because of his speeches within the four years that he ruled, César Nava called on the members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Erne Carne Zeletar.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Clader<0xC3><0xB3>n, let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell,” he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama Proposes Law to Support Undocumented Students on Twitter
“If you think the Dream Act is the right thing to do, please let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama has joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students.
“If you think the Dream Act is the right thing to do, please let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as a vote on the bill is nearing.
“As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard,” he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such blocking, which was announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to put together a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this issue and then we will be able to plan the order of the other issues,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a “vote to close the debate” on the Dream Act so that a motion to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though it is more likely next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, resided in the country for the past five years, and were admitted to an institution of higher education or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters carry out intensive agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act project need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are most negotiating are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida's outgoing Senator George Lemieux, who completed Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet spoken.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with the literature they insert a finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "to insert a finger into the wound" is similar to the Czech "to hit a nail on the head - note transl.)
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where the participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuelová, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure in the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle.
The finger in the wound "brings us into the narrow," the Argentinean writer spoke lovingly to an audience composed mostly of young people who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this round-table debate, moderated by Marisol Montelz and featuring Valenzuel.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celori, which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa acted in the first person as a protagonist who, in search of knowledge of what a "stroke" is, goes from a doctor to a doctor from whom she does not get an answer, albeit a trace.
From the infectious disease specialist leaves the convinced: "patience is not my strong point, maybe it will be my wound".
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who will reveal the secret: “the wound represents what is really open and the scar is symbolic.”
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she had only learned so much about the wound that it was really open and did not exist," but she was convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuela played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also came out with a delightful story, which he called The Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but at one point it appears.
With elements of magical realism, he tells of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far away, or corrected the integrity that one virgin had lost, this narrative which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which the story was told from the beginning by his own chroniclers who recited it.
Cervantes, who invented us all, derided the fake testimony that was presented as real in the stories, but in another way, he never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery that it lacked even shame.
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have greater imagination" and precisely where reality and lies merge, where one no longer knows which of the story belongs to one group and which to the other, fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the Cervantes tradition.
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its word Finger to the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-Portuguese writer pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
“I think good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which of course is not intended,” she said after saying the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers – and in their “chemical reaction.”
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that is in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and in the control of consciousness, which is overflowing with dogmatisms, it is forgotten that “behind every no there is a small no, and behind every denial there is a small yes.”
“To be masters of our thoughts and realities we must color: and to color means many times to put a finger in the wound and harass those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without color, and to harass the authorities who prefer this black and white world.”
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced both good and bad throughout his career, but he has already scored on three occasions for the decisive series.
in the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, besides, two different styles, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, during his career he has experienced both good and bad, but he managed to achieve on three occasions for the decisive series, but until now he has left with an untaken, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and played with the same team in the following finals.
As a coach, he reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament with the club Morelia, where he lost 4–2 to Toluca; then, in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he advanced again to the decisive duel and lost the match 3–1 to Rayados.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, the team again against the "Devils" of Toluca, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Uzená<0xC5><0x99>e" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says it is the most important institution for him.
“I want to come out as a winner, I don’t want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I’m committed to, and the title would of course be for me too, but the first thing is the most important thing,” the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in vivid memory has the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we have learned the lesson that until the referee writes the end, we can not celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that in this we can not learn until the end of the match".
He is not worried that this series could decide in the penalty shootout, he trusts his players: "Let's never try to get to a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were ready, unfortunately we were prepared for it, but unfortunately we were not prepared for this because of the bad fate
Romano has the chance to stop being the other and experience the glory of titles for the first time.
The United States is changing its visa rules.
People will have to contact the Visa Applicants Service Centres before interviewing at the Consular Section; costs will be lower and waiting times will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Application Service Centres (ASC) before interviewing at the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will collect the biometric information of the applicant and will be evaluated by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, among which are the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay a fee for arranging the meeting, another for processing the application and another for delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will pay only one fee, which will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and be fingerprinted.
Since biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who request a second interview meeting at the Consular Section will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. space agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for alien life.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce on Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA Headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalists, NASA assured that she would present “a discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life”, which aroused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could represent the possibility that they could one day become intelligent creatures such as humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere as it does on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that "there is another, another form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest moon) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form opposition bloc
Reforms to the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the advent of “bipartism,” they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term has not even started yet, when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n Democrática, Czech for "Party of the Democratic Revolution" - note.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech for "Party of Labour" - note.
Prior to the opening session of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD, and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo "screamed" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as he eliminated them.
With this reform, they repeated, "Bapartism" begins, because now it will be two persons from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santosová Aquilarová, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito from the PAN (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n, Czech for "National Action Party" - note.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality at the instigation of the parties PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they will talk with representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjected to these two parties, which ended the opposition coalition.
“When I got here, I was looking at it because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergence said they were in agreement with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and would therefore form a pluralistic group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, after it was a monopoly, would now be "dual."
The goal of law reform is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
This group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as added Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that currently Congress has become the “prey” of the two – in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It used to be controlled by only one party, now it's divided by two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo demanded that the personality of the Member be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
“In order for the five of us, who are probably already nine, but now see us in five, not to remain outside, each in a different faction, because of the archaic agreements, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have formed and agreed to, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform.”
A further 200,000 pesos are being spent for the "supplier"
The Mazatlán City Hall will pay another check to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the town hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacha Palazuelos.
Thus, the amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material rises to 1.2 million pesos.
According to the transparency page of the city hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, it was issued at the amount of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was listed "settlement of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, an additional amount.
What hasn't been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camacha Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last on 16 November.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent other administrative authorities from using their services, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the town hall supplier again.
In the past, after July 25, Noroeste published a review of checks issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Sánchez's three-year term, the city of Camacha Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also transacted with Jumapam, where it collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places in need of maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the poor condition of Sánchez Taboada’s Mazatlan pavilion in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist to the recess at Sánchez Taboada’s gazebo, the tourism sector in Mazatlan is asking authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and thus do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Zona Dorada Area Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the revenue they’re missing, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance on the part of the city hall.
"The councillor will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, he will have to devote himself to preventive maintenance, not only to repair existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because even as residents we deserve clean housing, the city hall should change its strategy of maintenance of the city."
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer).
“Today, for tourists to come, it does not only matter about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city abounding in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out,” he said.
"There hasn't been enough attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city hall, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a sub-secretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which will need to be put in order first to make these places more attractive and to be able to include them in the list we have for the promotion of this destination.”
IP Demands Results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state faces.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is in turmoil and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has begun, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence party and the last from the PVEM party, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
It is on the list of expectations of new members of Congress to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrimony will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), has proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great responsibility and lead by example on the path to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival processions of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging that would move the ruling party forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and be primarily committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an effort to achieve the economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support job creation in some way."
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give it more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investments that, moreover, directly compete with agriculture."
In addition to spending on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help deliver the state with certainty and help with the alcohol bill, which has not been resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
They are looking for three kings.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the children’s wish list of the Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their ideas about the upcoming holiday of the Three Kings, since their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father does not have a permanent job.
“Sometimes it’s hard because my husband is out of luck, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebeians’ on the street to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a monster car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetano would have wanted a one-year-old outfit.
“He said to me, ‘I wish I had this monster car,’ but I said, ‘We’ll see, son,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetano recalls with sadness.
For older children who have just been to school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size 12, 10-year-old Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as has a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing sneakers, so he could really use a pair of size five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign "The Three Kings Are Seeking", and bring a gift or cash at the reception of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 Suspected Drug Dealers Who Were Arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places used for drug production.
“Approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce it have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both presumed heads of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The men were ordered to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possessing it for the purpose of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
The searches followed a lengthy investigation that lasted almost a year.
“It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests,” Ruel said.
The police operation involved 70 officers from the regional investigation unit of the city of Estria, the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Police Department, Memphrémagog.
Illegal immigration will continue unabated.
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will clearly be defeated, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand squarely on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow the detention for up to one year of any person originating from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading toward the wrong goal.
"We are against it, and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The NPD critic on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that we should take action against illegal immigrant smugglers and that is what we consider to be a pillar of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and places children in prison for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition.
“Canadians are telling MPs en masse that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are taking Canada at gunpoint and treating it like some kind of thug.”
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Secretary Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to an election leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI news agency that the government would ask for a vote so that any MP who opposed it would be held accountable for his or her stance to his or her constituents.
Unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying not to forget this idea: Quebec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation from New York on this issue as early as January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
No more was needed for public security critic Stéphane Bergeron, a PQ party member, to describe the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "an amateur solution flogged on its knees".
Dutil himself replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing at a public hearing.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is confirming that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he is hiding something," he explains.
“The only way to get a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposed that Quebec grant a special authorization to the Inspector General to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, which allow him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also like Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so that it is better suited to this type of crime.
This request would be based on the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under close supervision.
Several watercourses came under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The road's crooked.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, by region.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
It could drop a total of up to 100 millimeters.
If we add these precipitations to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can worry about flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning on Wednesday night for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentides, and in Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were subject to flood-related emergency and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re caused severe precipitation of watering of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was pulled down as a result of heavy rains.
Two homes had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the discharge of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is on standby and is monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec-based Centre for Flood Prediction issued flood warnings on Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blabbed
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before Canada’s Broadcasting Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians, as well as harsh language during broadcasts.
The Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians of gross expression which does not correspond to broadcasting during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their own lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council has received several complaints concerning comments made during broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of Social Support Recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts reported in the broadcasts were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the controversial episodes of the Dupont Noon News ran into a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The latest dispute concerned the statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he did not send any donation to help Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that those in need will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image of Haitians.
"I've already made up for my three-day postponement."
"My file has been untouched for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use rough language in broadcasting.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio broadcasts cooperated "beyond their duties".
For a station that will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuv<0xC3><0xA0> of Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange run.
An athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing, enters the tatami and rings of the whole world and looks for new challenges.
“I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
“In my case, I look for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don’t like playing on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from October 23rd to 30th, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They were invited opponents who finished first four in the last world championship in each category."
"I won a bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he said.
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one goal to keep in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the King of Sanda, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
“It’s kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee [the biggest stadium in Thailand].”
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competing per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-final winners will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that the only champion, the king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed, by mutual agreement, 450 million in contracts with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of 295 million dollars without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was commissioned in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem, which risks excluding competition and triggers price increases.
“It’s a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition.”
"This means that people no longer make side deals in secret, they do it openly today," Sylvain Simard, a member of parliament, told a news conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard put this question to the National Assembly, because he says he has a hard time bearing how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, strongly denying that this contract was a collusion.
“I have my own path,” she thundered, claiming that PQ was “unfair” and “missing accuracy.”
She said "that would be the least of it" to apologize to PQ.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that will allow two or more businesses to pool their mutual expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the scope of work.
Construction is already underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the field of engineering consulting is the subject of an investigation by the government.
Flying over the Quebec business register at speed will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors: CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As for the <0xC3><0x89>nergie Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamics of the labour force and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will make us cringe at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you're going to a competition and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher."
"You have two choices: that you pick up the people who appear in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, 'Let's make a deal satisfactory and at a good price.'
"But the main idea is that the important thing is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir calculated 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin scored 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "Energie gérance".
All contracts were closed.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also associated with the firms that "fund" her, before specifying that they are more of her management staff.
Responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in "impartial" brands and environmental certifications, to be guided accordingly in the choice of products.
Worst of all, even as we bathe in a media universe that urges and urges us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to comply with obligations that it qualifies even as a brake on its commitment, Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre cites responsible consumption, whose first article was published yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still don’t trust them very much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t trust companies’ environmental promises, simply because green advertising companies are finding a measuring tool that was developed by the Sherbrooke University Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible, Baromete said.
In the same way, the politicians' debate on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount to stimulating this aspect of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebec's population is suspicious of the product data or the "green" services we are looking for in order to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping with merchants in their neighbourhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre said.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to minimize the impact on the environment by taking care of the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they use public transport or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this large-scale behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested to participate financially in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallele", which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than an expected gift, the Quebec government proposes a loan, the amount of which would, after all, be lower, there were some initial expectations that could build the basis for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and a request for $12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinema project.
The final report was sent 10 days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec opposed the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of the eXcentris, concluding that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the premises of his cinemas during ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could have been the reason for the change by the financial council of the state.
The lack of theaters for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, is leading a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will raise $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
As of spring 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallele, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and to screen Xavier Beauvois’ most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not mention Le Devoir and so ignores himself, so he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are being made to him.
Raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic American sources made public via WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex inferiority of Canadians towards Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that Canadian-American relations are at the heart of every Canadian voter when it comes to voting, and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, released to the public yesterday, provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The September 22, 2008 communiqué, in the midst of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian inferiority complex, almost fixed, makes possible political leaders to talk about internal bets, instead of realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
“The United States, then,” he concluded, “is the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be talked about.”
The ambassador understands this "declaring silence" all the less as the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls.”
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa <0xC3><0xA0> Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure that the government remains in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan,” writes Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that the opposition parties make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative image that the United States is being thrown at the dramatic series aired on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe not too witty references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some Guantanamo detainees.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State."
"Secret received with the intention of revising the file."
Finally, let us note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told the CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan in Cancun to restore home, shop and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas effect (GES) limit that corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional limit to be achieved for stabilizing the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the absence of hard-to-reach reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the hot bulbs that monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market are replaced with fluorescent bulbs or, better still, with light-emitting diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a significant amount of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet generated by lighting would be from.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the world’s car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will need to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve stabilization of climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to exclude that it does not get out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new bulbs with DEL, we reduce this consumption by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new incandescent bulbs with DEL, such as those launched this week by Philips – this company reportedly participated in a UN study – have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection facilities.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact light bulb, but rather a thermal coal-fired power plant, which emits much of the mercury needed to produce electricity squandered in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, they put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of a $3.5 billion thermal power plant.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has demanded that the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire be published immediately after the deadline.
“The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay,” the spokesman said.
"It asks all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the latest date - Wednesday midnight - to expire without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's scrotum.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was “continuing its work” to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were calls around the world for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the Constitutional Council’s cancellation of the “fraudulent” vote in the north, which has been administered by former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, confirmed that the voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of the President of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire from going to vote.
The elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dre, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political faction of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter in France.
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (BIT) has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to provisional seasonal variation correction (CVS) data published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilized at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are out of work in the third quarter but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of today’s young people in the labour market has been exacerbated by a new increase in the unemployment rate, reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the International Labour Office.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months as well as in a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 and above and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, by contrast, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a 9.8% rate for France (including the DOM) in October, after a 9.9% rate in September.
Alexandre Guerini is indicted and in custody.
Alexandre Guerini, 53, one of the heads of waste processing companies and the brother of PS Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was indicted and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of a public procurement investigation, allegedly obtained in good faith.
Alexandre Guerini has been charged with misappropriation of company assets, misuse of public funds and public assets, concealment, bribery, accepting bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, and not some kind of delusion."
“It’s easy to pursue him for many criminal reasons, but it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guerini said, through his lawyers, that he had sent a brief communication to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of any such thing, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former CEO of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and left at large, under judicial supervision with a ban on socializing, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation of all the facts that are reproached him."
"The investigating judge will take this into account and leave him free," his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux, said in a statement.
Four other people have been charged and released overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy CEO with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "the theft and misuse of the company's assets", the other for "complexity in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guerini’s business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “concealing the misuse of the company’s assets.”
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company of aiding and abetting money laundering from large-scale gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009, following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerates Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for “espionage,” united views in France, put diplomacy on alert and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the downsides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the US justice system for the mellow trade in material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they expose to sharp light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing for it.
A diplomatic cable written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with a hostage".
The adviser from the Elysee Palace for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do just as much for being transported back to the homeland by their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “constantly say the words ‘fundamental human rights’, ‘innocence’, ‘immediate liberation’ in the media.”
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, must be brought into trouble.
"The more you do it, the more they'll ask you to stop doing it."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “masters of evasive maneuvers.”
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is “an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of ‘political blackmail’.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French embassy grants her asylum) "will require payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (a security deposit of 230,000 euros).
And it will announce that the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that is "going to escalate."
“In the future, the Iranians could arrest an additional 1,800 French people living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims has been expelled for trafficking in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which pursues illegal Iranian networks to obtain material for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France entered into a treaty?
The liberation of Iran for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace, he said, was not only “surprised by the judge’s decision” but was looking for a way to oppose it.
“There have been talks between the presidential office and the justice minister” (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the court’s decision,” he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by French intelligence.
The Elysee Palace adviser dials the phone number, hangs up the phone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss’s imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized “escapes” into the media, to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad that he is playing a “significant” and “influential” role as a “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "brilliance" of French officials.
What is the basis of such a level of "gratitude" expressed towards M. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their statements, the laudable French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.”
The documentary then deals with the reasons that forced the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication “is aimed at validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyses.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and has been marked as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
It also aims to “sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
“That should at least create confusion and confusion among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace.
In the communique, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
South Korea’s government will pass a law called “Pecival” that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the culture ministry and the ministry of family said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministry's top official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, allowing them to limit their time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
2018-2022 FIFA World Cup: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspected corruption is set up by FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a politically-motivated choice where the fight for influence and lobbying risks overtaking technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the royal FIFA competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the world's economic and political stakes.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of taking until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too weighty for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour set for the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of the revelations leading to the suspension of two members of the CE (European Commission?) for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have destroyed the chances of her country, the cradle of football, which so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
The BBC put a crown on it on Monday when it aired a document that “pinned” three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA unhappy and put English leaders in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who managed to secure the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal do not miss the trumps of the already prepared stadiums,his benevolence (the World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal allusions barely twisted to the accusations of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, try to compromise them," Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable experience from 1994.
The world’s highest-performing economy, home to Fifa’s main sponsors, appears to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have drawn up a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa ardently desires, has made the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out a big aces in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for the feeble TV (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, which is the driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle hesitated.
Mitterrand gave the impression that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The Mandate of the Elysian Palace summons someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the secrecy involved in the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if the doubts are constantly persisting.
In one sense and in another.
In 2006, unbelievably, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims that a third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would "decid sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminds the members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has sown a little feverish state.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement, not an announcement.
This isn’t the first time he’s been reminded of the humorous tone of the presidential election in such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half years to go with me,” he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it's because of a double truth.
Accelerating the path to candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the entrance to Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal’s cradle, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
This is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to organize into combat formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we do not discuss the matter with the UMP," the people of the Prime Minister's immediate vicinity reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he believes defeat is possible, he will not run,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, level with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank of the year was intended to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for recovery from the crisis or, at the very least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges, the securities institution will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today so tense in European securities markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of resolving the debt crisis of European states.
She did not say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my opinion for my European partners (...) ".
The evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit about his intentions, and he was content to say that the programme for the purchase of state titles in the secondary market “continues” and that “we see” this session taking place.
The only certainty is that the European Central Bank will keep its basic interest rate unchanged at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the Central European Bank’s purchases of treasury bonds have doubled to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unwiseness of the negotiators in the market, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders in the market about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists don’t expect any major changes in the exchange rate.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank’s arsenal, the latter bank shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine she would change her program in any significant way."
“If not, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the sluggish market," adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to compensate at all costs for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performances by states, which are among the most fragile," the major bond administrator testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will worry more about reducing their debt rather than stabilising it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government has its back.
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the worrying situation eased a little, yesterday with the reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
A return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the heads of the regions said that they had heard Giulia Tremonti classifying the situation as "insoluble" and that he expected an "unforeseen" weekend, which he then debunked.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest stood at a record 210 basis points and the price of CDSs soared to 263 points, causing some disruption in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, has said he is "too busy" with "tempestuous market developments" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencryptedly, its problem is a lack of growth and sluggish fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis, at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will account for another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (versus 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new set of amendments to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, tough new measures will have to be taken,” said Olli Rehn, the EU’s economic affairs commissioner.
For the time being, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
“The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time,” Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s Governing Council, said in a statement.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries,” notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, which could then be followed by elections scheduled for the end of March.
This would be the beginning of a period that is not suitable for taking a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very much in solidarity, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion regarding interest rates on European government bonds has brought water to the mill for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor’s notation office said it could degrade Portugal’s debt record, the target most targeted by various speculations.
“Because in May, there is a real lack of transparency and clarity in policy, particularly in banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time moves more slowly than market time.”
Conscious of this broken link and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the problem, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Group from the beginning of next week.
The Central Bank of the European Union is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support the market-oriented countries of the euro area (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, made a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the goal of this path to increase funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized through additional direct involvement in FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict measures with a quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid had a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before they apply their own budgetary adjustments and decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Finally, capital participants in European funds are talking about options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to tap the stock of securities again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is an actor in the very first European sovereign debt trading plan, believe that an addition of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A Council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange alert.
Snowfalls are still causing problems in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that have already declared orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and snowing lightly on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow surges are big enough to cause traffic disruptions and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods transport - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and police recommend driving your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No special measures for the restriction of freight traffic are foreseen on Wednesday evening.
The District Office "calls on all motorists to exercise the greatest possible caution on the roads and to adapt driving to the nature of the road."
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport in Paris and 10% to Orly due to expected snowstorms.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airports in south London and Edinburgh Airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the discussion of modernising transport on Ile-de-France was in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular the $23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source for the contracts.
Today we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms established to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favor of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists in order "to modernize it, to increase the yield obtained from it and to make this increase affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
It's a delusion.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're a long way from 4 billion.
“It is specified that these fiscal resources are connected to the 4 billion euros from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilized by the state and invested in the company Société du Grand Paris according to the project,” we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
For us at SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
“From the moment we generate revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then rake in up to 4 billion,” it explains here.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 promised billions belong to the absent subscribers, runs the risk of triggering a somewhat lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on December 7.
Vengeful Hackers and Causal Spies
The Wikileaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let's keep things in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
Berlusconi’s “extraordinary revelations” about the way Americans live their lives reveal what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all but these two Berlusconi’s own), and Qaddafi’s infamous caricature profile has long been a subject for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of reports already known is fundamental in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that deals with esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are engaged in occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) head of the intelligence services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, an editor in the newspaper Libération), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
Why, then, was there so much confusion about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly to a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that this is being repeated in public dishonors the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most top-secret information from the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not a negligible one, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "perpetrator".
But let's move on from here to the deep truth of what happened.
Once, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to contain all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orwell’s prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, he became a citizen a total victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of some hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can he hold on to a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is a meaningless secret (and a meaningless secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious meaningless secret, because it is extracted from public life; but to reveal Clinton was, as WikiLeaks did, a meaningless secret.
WikiLeaks made no mistake about Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something great for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the established power so significant?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equal to its publication on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies it is useless to hope that messages can be kept secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I am well aware that for the time being my prognosis is science fiction and therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are discreetly transporting formalities along uncontrolled routes and carrying only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide rare information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-locked drawers: All in all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated the wire-based telegraph.
Videocassettes (analog) allowed cinema lovers to shoot a movie step by step, slide it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digital) allow only to jump through chapters, that is, through macros.
By high-speed trains we will reach Milan from Rome in three hours, while we need three and a half hours to travel by plane and transport, which includes.
It is not extraordinary, then, that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn carriages.
One final note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was being done in the secrecy of the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to try to keep promises of quick-start funding (fast-start or early-start funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were exposed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion for three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to funding a fast start: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation is invaluable and valued for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like to be treated equally and with the same degree of precision by all developed countries and civil society.
The EU announces that it released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to deliver on its promise of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, this funding is "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million for three years to the title of fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with terms at the level of public development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of the Public Development Assistance d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), it is supposed to keep its commitment regarding the financing of "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 borrowed is equal to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be evidenced for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission reduction, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as the equivalent of our liabilities, but as the loan rate for the country (the rate of interest for the creditor).
But France can only give the following justification: it is "keeping" its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million, of which 91.5% is a loan (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>389.8 million) and 8.5% is a gift (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million) - see the EU document for yourself.
It is the only country in the European Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany asked for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) kept their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfill its promise, France will give only 10 centimes and consider this effort comparable.
What a beautiful piece of juggling!
To sum up, in its "fast start" financing, France operates with double fraud: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time, and on the other with a real financial burden.
Despite spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, he can convince himself that he is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it was Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would member states continue donating when you only need to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever the case may be, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its accounting practices for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its obligations and with decency and fairness vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing long-term financing deposits (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of "additionality" or the method of posting loans.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive in these deposits as in the others.
So everyone is putting their hope in the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alarming about the pesticides children will ingest.
A 10-year-old child will one day ingest 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex-Rights and Preservation of Future Generations Movement).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the issue being processed," bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a snack for one child of about a decade in supermarkets.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, have been analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are bright carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to the endocrine glands (IBS), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical ingested individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten residuums with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil and reported as a small snack in a study, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, for which studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, beefsteak from minced meat, tuna in a can, and even a bun and chewing gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the “richest” with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
"The ultimate risk to consumers of this 'contamination cocktail' is likely to be underestimated," the study said.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) proposed "faced with an urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the rise of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
