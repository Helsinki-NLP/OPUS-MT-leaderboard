Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transfer at the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, talking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech national team for a game general with the Americans and then also for a sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Netherlands.
At Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois takes over in the Premier League for the first time in ten years as a substitute at the London club.
It has been speculated for some time that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atletico Madrid and failed to make it into the league season when he lost 2–4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He missed the French league season with two wins and two draws, shooting St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
The most pressing is the AS Monaco shoe club.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille 1-1 at the weekend.
There were reports on tabloid English websites today that they might want a Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, <0xC4><0x8C>ech’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet wrote a 4:1 rate on it.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that can not be refused.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer that can't be rejected looks like.
First of all, it would depend on the position of Chelsea, whether the club would deal with a possible offer or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer while you are in Prague?
Wouldn’t you need to sign a new contract somewhere?
That's not what I was thinking.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, they are all somewhere in the national team meetings and certainly a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can you afford?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation when I did not catch the first three games of the new season is new for me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
"I want to continue to take part in the fight for Chelsea's position and it is up to the coach to decide what decisions he will make over the coming weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family, of course, belong.
Is it possible that you’ll be playing for another club in England?
That's a question I never thought I'd be asked.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
New Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe to discuss economic and security commitments on his first major visit since his election victory in May.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to cement economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
The list includes, first of all, plans for more extensive cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
India also hopes the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues, according to the report.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it ran 125 km/h in a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h and drove into a bush to escape the police officers.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the roadside this morning when they noticed that it was going 125 km/h when leaving the petrol station at Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into a bush, so the police lost sight of him.
A motorcyclist and a person matching the driver’s description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have charged a 20-year-old with disobeying a call to stop and reckless driving.
He will stand trial in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster Accused of Rape in Hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man is on trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charges during a hearing at the Glasgow High Court.
On 7 June 2013, he allegedly raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the allegations, Webster attacked her while she was “unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.”
Webster is also charged with raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a date for her trial at the Edinburgh High Court on 17 November.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect union organization as a civil right.
“The way unions work, middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator for Minnesota who co-chairs the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to be able to introduce, together with the model of the occasional rights of John Lewis, a law strengthening the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to defend against discrimination in union organizing as in other forms of discrimination – and stop anti-union forces
Adjusting the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination to join unions, go to civil court - and award compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents of the law are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states — Americans once encouraged countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country in one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States seized Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, they included language in them and openly recognized that “the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States seized Germany after World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
The provisions that will restrict this right or seek to harm it will be repealed. The measures leading to the fulfillment of such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt’s guarantees that “everyone has the right to form and join trade unions to protect their interests.”
Americans have accepted for generations the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form labor unions – and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in a position of equal partner – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the trade unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to unprecedented levels.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is greatly delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have elevated America and made it a true promise of democracy.
A judge has temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers said would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The decree, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion practitioners to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain this permission in the meantime.
“The proposing party will be able to legally conduct its business and, in the meantime, obtain a permit,” federal judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution regarding the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be safe from the insidious law that is designed to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs and were also seeking permission to do so.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such provisions unconstitutional.
A key piece of Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state was blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Advocates for women’s abortion rights, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such a permit imposes requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argued that the measures were intended to protect women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to the measures.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, there is only one abortion practitioner in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for the grant application to be processed.
Ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video to pay tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women for seven years of treatment.
Dr Jordan said the chances of survival affected women's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"The disease is best treated by gynecologists, who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving distance medical services to overcome the barrier of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer, regardless of geographical location, is low, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young Gold Coast mother named Elisha Neave was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decline associated with an extraordinary decline in homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to garden centres losing up to <0xC2><0xA3>10 million a year by the time today’s younger generation of consumers reach the “major age groups of gardeners.”
According to the report, people who rent a home spend on their gardens, on average, 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
Other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, include an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, a preference for cobblestones instead of front gardens used as parking areas, and a shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household has the lowest spending on horticultural products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that subletting or lack of space did not mean people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser for RHS, said: “Renters are very fond of growing plants in pots – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also for this year, he predicted higher sales due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at a meeting of his youth organization, which most reminds me of Hitlerjugend, shook off atomic weapons and basically told everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both agitated nationalism and a complex of inferiority that can transform them into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to pass differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars of domination over Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and that it is necessary to regain their international position.
This mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and was followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today’s situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is very similar indeed.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half was trembling before them.
It was probably the fault of the Western politicians themselves, maybe they patted Vladimir on the shoulder a little, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted and maybe they underestimated him and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He made himself at home in order, pretending that he didn't want to go anywhere, and grinding knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back his lost positions.
He'll start slow, he's got time.
The leader is probably for life, so where would he hurry.
He trampled the Caucasians, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then it's the dwarves of the Baltics.
They've been pinching the Russian bear in the fur long enough.
This will certainly be noticed by China, which is jumping out of its way and is definitely looking to the far east.
And the Germans are also really pissed off about how well they're doing, and we put that on their ass at 45.
How about making a new Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary.
That would be a base and there are a lot of ours there and as they oppress them and the dacha they already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
After all, their prime minister, Mr. Sobotka, is so soft, he can peel like an onion and eat the whole of their EU.
That's how they'd play it if they jumped on a big Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as detonators, we will use our fellow tribesmen who live in their territory.
There are a lot of Russians everywhere, and when they say they are being oppressed there, they are simply being oppressed there, and we are not going to let them, we are going to protect them.
And again the Russian will rule, for what else is he born to do?
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition on which the proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister has summoned the country's top US diplomat to explain a report on US and British spying activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former US National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said all major states were monitoring each other.
An earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones Showcases Other Season 4 Tricks
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth series of the cult series.

Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the Calvia municipality to the Office of the Attorney General of Mallorca.
The Calvia police chief on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after being charged by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Magaluf party district.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after corruption charges were brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street that houses most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the municipality of Calvia on Friday to the prosecutor of the anti-corruption office of Mallorca.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police for links to corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarre.
Spain’s national newspaper ABC quoted disgruntled night business owners as saying that public officials’ favouritism has had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money, it's about surviving," one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and rioters at holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event took place with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the tour of the bars of the Carnage company, pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashion wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
The spring brought an icy surprise to South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds that severely hit Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected in the city until nine o'clock in the evening, and another 6.6 mm falls during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few short rain showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind that started before eight o'clock in the evening and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8 °C on Monday.
It is believed that the stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19:30, but for a short distance it was hit by a change in speed or wind direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop from the second landing and finally landed at about 20:40.
The delay in the flight caused delays in other flights, including Emirates’ flight from Dubai and Qantas’ flight from Sydney.
Temperatures in Adelaide are forecast to reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. Schools in Gaza, however, remain closed while the territory recovers from fighting.
The start of the school has brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel marked by the attacks, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of a kindergarten hit by a rocket removed debris from the wall and are slowly awaiting the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to be back in school.
"We've had some rough times, and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibbutz, located near the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until a cease-fire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The education minister said about 12 families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza, which was hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently and added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite peace deal on Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas’s demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radical, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in a hundred UN schools that have turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding and the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope they open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is worried about the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon on Wednesday before the preliminary match against the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-man squad, Spartan striker David Lafata, who is plagued by fever, is in trouble.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was about more players and David still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
“Whether it will be two or three days or tomorrow he will be fit, it will be seen according to his state of health, which will be decided by our doctor,” he added.
The other players are okay.
“Of course someone has a pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or participate in a game on Wednesday against the United States,” he said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Vácha as the last player of the Spartan midfielder.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to make, and other midfielders were included.
I decided based on the fact that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I stand behind it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens with Latata
It is not excluded that in case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
Over the weekend, for example, Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural from Liberec, who gave a hat-trick, flashed with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata does.
If he cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not say that I cannot nominate any of the players who have impressed in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon the national team is training at Strahov, on Tuesday then the classic pre-game training before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the premiere victory under Vrba.
In the previous three pre-season games, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 at 20:45.
Pedestrians go to the Netherlands to Italy
The willow is happy to have more time for training than the previous encounters.
It’s an advantage to have a player for eight days and to be able to practice certain things with them that we didn’t have as much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing as best as possible for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will perform in Italy before the match in Prague on Thursday and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary national team coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a fight and we're going to have a fight and we're going to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, apartment prices have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the Data CoreLogic Hedonic index, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Tim Lawless, director of research at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data shows that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
The other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices averaging between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by government-mandated spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1,4 % during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continued high rate of auction sales, generally high speed of sales and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19 and who worked in the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is trying out a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is upbeat.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother’s death, Henry has undergone “extensive” therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve just heard his voice: “Stop that noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a kid, they were adults — would go to a bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I've never spoken to him like that before.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he had seen what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth, where flames go off and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always climbed into the tub and just lay there, then he could hear himself slowly beginning to sing to himself, as he was washing the foundry clean of himself.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
He is still good friends with French, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show up, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
No one wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in theatre.
This was followed by a Comedy of Errors and a Plot by August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the talent contest New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television."
He studied on the march.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to invent working jokes, be a star, and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry ended up appearing in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was uneasy about it.
I wish it would never happen, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "for years a prized staple of British television" but was also "a grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both ridiculed and glorified British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
It took him decades of commercials, documentaries, TV series, and movie roles, but after airing his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, a little bit of it looks like you're stuck in one place, or a little bit of you're getting out of the way."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn it well in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, “You should try it.”
Don't bother if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave twenty lines of Othello's closing speech for the document, and he was on his way.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if that would give me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsal was tough, and before that, I'd been reading the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They looked like they were in for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for seizing the audience.
“A voice in my head said to me, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage, and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in The Plots at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fence was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like God’s sign saying, “You should do this.”
Of course, he says it with a SOUND voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has the brain of a comedian - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because to have the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're always looking for something, you could end up in a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I asked him if he would ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps to give the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya has started biometrically registering all of its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after they leave the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month on salaries of non-existent employees and on further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited in bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, said the BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All government officials must arrive at the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, the government said in a statement.
He further says that anyone who does not show up without a sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
“By identifying the real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clean up payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against government
According to local media, a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government.”
Police have not yet commented on the case.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior officials were among those detained.
Some of them were involved in a corruption investigation in December that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on 1 September.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by putting on embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for tough times
It brings with it a cloud of fame from the worlds of banking, media management, and the Conservative Party’s internal conclave.
She has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at the consulting firm Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years she was the Executive Director of the Financial Times, resigning when her junior colleague took over the top job at Pearson's parent company.
They say her severance pay was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former CEO of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inwards into the top tier of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also outwards into the voice of the public in times of unrest when things don’t work out.
It is an almost untenable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
But which director would risk entering a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it, and thus depriving himself of a job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren’t so hard, many people would like to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and its status revised.
As the scope of competition expands and new technology challenges old assurances, the immediate negotiation of BBC licence fees carries great danger.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each of which costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
BBC service usage patterns have changed: Today I get newspaper headlines on my mobile phone and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Gov. Perry says he didn’t approve of offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, released on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a Democratic attorney general who initiated criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted to Perry’s account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet went out of my account that wasn't authorized.
“I disagree with the tweet and I pulled it off,” he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to messages with questions.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for its management.
The previous tweet featured an unflattering, humorous image of U.S. Attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which brought Perry, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet read: “I don’t always drive with three times the blood alcohol limit... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry for calling me to account.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not led by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has suspended a $7.5 million payment from the Travis County-based Public Interest Defense Department that prosecutes corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done by now, tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal.
One of London’s most prominent developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for demanding clients Berkeley, said: “Since the beginning of the current budget year, the market has returned from its peak in 2013 to normal transaction levels.”
London’s housing market was doing well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening of the pound in recent months, London real estate has not been so attractive to foreign buyers - some of them were also intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and the talk of a possible "settlement tax", with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections next May.
Foxtons, a London-based real estate firm, warned last week that the April mortgage market review, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow the pace of market growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has lowered its forecast for London property prices to 3% for 2015 as house prices have already started to fall.
Meanwhile, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has dropped by a quarter every year, according to WA Ellis.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it raised cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same and this has kept forward sales going.”
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenue by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, before Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that Berkeley’s annual revenue is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Shares of Berkeley stopped at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posts naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence’s photos have leaked to the internet over a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for “obvious privacy violations.”
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker photos, which were originally published on the 4chan image-sharing server, were reportedly acquired thanks to a gap in the Apple iCloud Internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many of the photos are authentic, however, the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead on Twitter also criticized the act.
“I hope that those of you looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of your home are happy with yourselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the Nickelodeon cable TV series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied the photos were real, saying on Twitter: "These alleged nude photos of me are SUPPOSED, people."
It is better to cut it even in the crack. *Intentional pun*
Buzzfeed said on Sunday night that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the alleged photos were real.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually decomposed like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too complex, too violent, too isolated, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it in a low voice.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought to be her aunt, who had inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs were slyly signing on the windows as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Profile of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning the public station that supplied the country with comforting music and comforting messages, a glance at her suntanned crossed legs reminding him of his long-lost leg.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't banned - there really wasn't anything banned - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into the desuetud, as did the word desuetud.
The taste of the people has done what the law and the law could never do, and just as people in books choose memoirs in which the poor man becomes rich, cooks and romance novels, so in music ballads are chosen.
Cavern let himself be taken aback and began to play the imaginary piano, singing serenades to Ailla's big feet in a rude, comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth for a word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, though not directly outlawed, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room for one “if”.
When she started playing the tune, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
The same in humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed by the song.
Even though he hadn’t heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when favorite singers weren't black.
There is no law or pressure.
A loose society is one in which every part of it, with gratitude—with the gratitude of those who have been spared by chance—conforms to the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent, with temperament and constitution, were suitable for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will not be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were the plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washed the dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while WHAT HAPPENED was happening, if it happened, they were afraid that they would be accused of putting them in the fire, in fact they were afraid that the fire would consume them the next time - they opened a restaurant where they were selling beer.
To each according to his talent.
As she listened only to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the foul words that Cavern had just sung to her could make music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, overshadowing Kevern's view.
There was nothing to be seen in the whole wide world but the tangle of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not the feet at all.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles," he said.
I'm kind of weird.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was a deliberately cruel Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her couch, dropped the radio, and spilled the undrinkable wine.
It's elderberry wine, so the drink wasn't worth it.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm perversely attracted to you for being an idiot," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not spoken to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was crashing against them.
The same deranged men, then WHAT HAPPENED, even more insensitive and grumpy than their ancestors, smugglers and miscreants, were angrily wandering from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dared to refuse them or laugh at them.
A moron?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to pet her - petting has become the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to the sluggish ballads of love that the radio spewed - first to pet her, then to kill her.
In Kevern’s view, over-cultivation because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She felt angry, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave, as if she were watching him from a upstairs window, a man who had been caught up in what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart went out to him and to all the men in general, even though a few had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders dangling, ashamed, defeated, all combativeness left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until now, that she had ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, on her own, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where its mitigation or direct stoppage of money was most expected.
"A great deal has been done, and a great deal remains to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the dusty, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the church towers rising above the hedges, a touch of human kindness has historically only been discovered."
Some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the poods.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, swallow unhappy stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only in rural areas the old brutality is as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, on the roads and even on sports grounds, the new ones are undiscovered.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to be too flowery," her superior said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you gay?
Esme has once again defended her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"That's not why I'm asking," Rabinowitz said finally, "that I have anything against atheists, or lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unprejudiced societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated.
Obviously, you yourself are preconceived against the Church—things you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and energy.
Always dealing with WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, yesterday, is preparing the country with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind him, a pink flash of recommendation flashed on the blackboard, sending Ofnow out into the world for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to be silent, the spoken word is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied softly, when she was sure her supervisor had finished, "and I'm not saying that the wound didn't heal as we say it did.
My main concern is that if we are not warned about this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened if it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the tips of his fingers.
It meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You go too far in talking about venting your “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone, if I were you, that in understanding the past and in protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there were no “they.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we're honest with each other," Esme took courage, "we're no one's fault.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to be blamed, there are no things to be corrected, even if correction were appropriate and possible.
But what is the use of the past except to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz unzipped his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, releasing her.
The day she went to work as usual, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who ran onto the sidewalk in a way that passers-by described as “brutal and furious.”
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho claims that no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied orchestrating a coup to overthrow the government and say they have acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official headquarters and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family left for neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntelle Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army’s response to the threat of “political fanatics” that police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defence forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several reports from the intelligence service that there were several groups within the police force planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to set the country on fire,” he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action appeared to be an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to bear the hallmarks of a coup d'état," he said.
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was calm in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was under attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament in June over internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite the contrary claims, he does not undermine his government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month low.
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area in August, according to a closely watched survey.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders were lost and the factories were damaged by the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering a quantitative easing of the euro zone similar to the one the United Kingdom and the United States approached during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the brakes that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty has on producers are increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone’s second-largest economy, France, the PMI dropped to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring,” said Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting more monetary or tax stimulus to be implemented.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the purchasing managers’ production overview for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Manufacturers in the euro area have a very difficult life at the moment, as rising geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add even more uncertainty to the ever-difficult conditions in many countries.
This increasing trade uncertainty has demonstrably affected consumer confidence in particular, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He said that as “even more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Hell for the Beslan Survivors: Ten Years of Terror from Occupied School Still Suffering
Ten years ago, thousands of people were taken hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school's atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific siege of a school in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy united East and West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to search for some of the victims who had escaped death during the school’s atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted the disaster, even though the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine — and in which children like them are dying — is over.
Girl Trying to Climb Back Into Ruined School Gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov trying to climb back into a bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
The bewildered Aida was desperately searching for her mother Larissa, now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I had blood on my feet.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
There were pieces of shards in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly hasn't destroyed it," she said firmly.
“It just happened to me, and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate Jera Gapoeva was killed there.
When we were kids, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from the UK and from other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, as I climb through the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the catastrophe and prevent it from happening again.
The Boy Who Escaped The Rain Of Bullets And Believed His Mother Was Dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the floor and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a baby crying on the way, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me his mother is dead.”
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with her leg injured, thinking her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the now-defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that the memories are fading.
I remember, right after that, I threw away all my guns to play with.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he worries about places like Ukraine, where he suffers as much as he and his friends suffered because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I feel so sorry for everyone who has to go through such horror,” says Damir, who took part in a volunteer activity at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers his trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borscht, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think many children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they hear when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up to be a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to his six classmates, and from time to time they go to the gym and light candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember him sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He wasn't asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw away all his guns or other weapons to play with. Damir is 17 today, he is taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got back on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was pretty sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember screaming ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go on unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo was taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates in the face, fear was embedded in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes increasingly difficult to think about it and talk about it.
There won't be a day that goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn’t feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
The image of Grigorije (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at the picture and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today Grigory says: “The important thing is that this does not happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but the truth will never be known.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little, it takes decades.
It affected my health, I can still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
So when September 1st comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived being held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a terrorist during the attack, but he managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It looks to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but couldn't because of injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind me.
I’m older now, and it’s been said that children with bad experiences are better able to deal with — I have to say, that’s not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please do not ask me to show you where I sit in this well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
When it comes to my physical health, I’m fine.
I have to be careful of my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm walking normally now.
But even so, for health reasons, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me that was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It’s not something that kids should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be there.
It's inside, and it's getting worse with the anniversary coming up.
I will attend the memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorius is an adult today, but he carries the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that about 50% of the horror has already been overcome, but it is impossible to completely overcome it and forget.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God could give me, but the loss of the dead hurts me.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could pick up all those rebels and throw them away as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to a safe Russian special commando (left).
He is now ten years old (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world was stunned when a Russian police officer carried little Alyon out of a Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar captive in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona’s mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan has remarried and they have a little girl named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said, “It’s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he reminds of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of beating a girl at the transition to a sign in the village of Fife
An eighty-seven-year-old man is on trial for hitting a three-year-old girl during a transition to a sign in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
The plaintiffs claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the charges in a court in Dundee.
Judge Charles Macnair has set a standstill date for January.
4 Tips on How to Take Better Photos and Videos Underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact camera such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with a couple of cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but for the best results, several rules apply.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, adjust the camera according to the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you do, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for 5 feet, others for 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both conventional and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them will not work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose your photos, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the surface.
With deeper immersion, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in photos - the deeper you dive, the fewer colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That’s great advice if you’re shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dim light.
This is especially important when shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the sick from the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the effects of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the vast majority of patients treated are interested in something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the flu symptoms and found himself impatient and involving his wife Juliet with remorse.
He remarked, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague X-rayed his chest.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was previously referred to as "miraculous", but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was in use, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation stackers, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
Such complacency is not appropriate.
As it turns out, the Mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from this disease per year is twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for a mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of a mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
Thus, the mesothelioma does not respect social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools do not constitute a refuge.
The world is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put on insulation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It is possible that there was a lot of asbestos in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been in practice at Guy's Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of that year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Illness is always deadly.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to the leading British expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Pett, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory glance at the files from the archives of the courts, to which disabled people often turn and require compensation, shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, Marks & Spencer admitted this June that it was negligent in exposing asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw two clothing stores, one of which was the company's flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are over 20.
“Before this happened,” he says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
It never occurred to me in my dreams that he might have anything to do with me.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name because of its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most commonly, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “major health risk” that can cause death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that “there is compelling but circumstantial evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
A Marsk & Spencer employee has been exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pett points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient studies claim that “a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
Much of this exposure is due to the "normal use and weathering" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the centre of government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as a “strong stream of air.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case, the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament’s Directorate of Services has insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a ‘positive medical certificate’, it is now expected that it will take <0xC2><0xA3>1 million and several years of work to thoroughly inspect Parliament, modernise electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, the seats of the Parliament will be held in the Greens rather than in the West.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, is suspected of having been exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a chill.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was just in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly I shivered.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't driving home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from the spleen, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He spent a month at home.
Confused doctors X-rayed his chest and inserted a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the chest lining and the lung lining.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year’s Eve: “They told me it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“Asbestos has been shown to be widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to show signs of the disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were in the basement of hospitals, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, a few decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could be saved, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos has been removed to this day.
Pupils built Bunsen’s kahan on asbestos mats
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in the countless hours of chemistry students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
A website has been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison embedded in a large number of homes,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one asbestos contact that a woman with mesothelioma could remember, in the 1970s, during the demolition of a garden house.
So be careful how you knock down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while to figure it out,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive — breathing itself — is what causes cancer to kill.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the urethra and can cause cell mutation.
“The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is, paradoxically, the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treats other patients who have been exposed to asbestos, probably during their practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
It has been invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer do not take up so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the spleen," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer “doesn’t respond much to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect” but doesn’t cure it.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
Following the discovery of the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counsellor for equally disabled people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: “Hello, you’ve reached the cancer center.”
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago and is still very active.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and would likely extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they examined me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a claim and they would have to approve his payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for mesothelioma patients.
But when the various treatments ultimately fail, many patients face another financial worry — the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts and asking for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually came to terms, but according to Morgan, this was not a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was a result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation, Guy’s Hospital confirmed that “asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Reducing fatal asbestos exposure to one company or place of work — usually decades after it happened — has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
The insurance records are gone.
And those who are now defending the charges have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was approved this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek redress, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, paid for by insurance companies, for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In this case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be awarded to them by the court as compensation - approximately <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Like mesothelioma patients, Andrew Morgan thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350m is a “good job”.
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay if time had not intervened and people with mesothelioma were able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former labor and social affairs minister, admitted that the law “had loopholes.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, there was a need for swift action.
"People are suffering too much and they need help right now," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a triple treatment that Lang-Lazdunski can boast of a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was strengthened.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Inspections showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had a few spots [cancers] spread in my chest.
My 50th birthday was just around the corner.
It's not life-threatening.
He's taking it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
Currently, there are no signs of a tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how an alarm clock works on a boiler.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and in the end also brought to Stephen Jay Gould) an unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.”
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen cooking pots and increase heat resistance.

In Italy, asbestos begins to appear in commercial use, it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
During the Industrial Revolution, it was an excellent insulating agent in steam engines and turbines.
Global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.

Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs "were undoubtedly the cause of her death."
This is the first case of this kind.

He won't pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships were intensively built, and work in shipyards posed the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health claim for asbestos exposure in the UK.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK’s Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
The use of all types of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
In the United Kingdom, the Mesothelioma Act enters into force.
A $350 million compensation program has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material.
World production stands at two million tons per year.
China Refuses to Give Hong Kong Authority to Elect Leaders – Protesters Promise Revenge
China’s parliament decided on Sunday to block Hong Kong voters from nominating candidates for the 2017 election, despite mounting debate on democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to expel any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“We weren’t surprised, but we were furious,” said Democratic lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They lied to people in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s leadership election would cause “chaos.”
Since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing has promised to allow people to vote in executive elections starting in 2017.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly in the hands of a committee nomination process that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most-watched protests in years.
Behind most pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central movement stands with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy in the Rain movement gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it will begin a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organisers said the movement had “concerned the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event that all options for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Centre is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and on Sunday stepped up protection of the government's headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Inciting unrest is seen by many Hong Kongers as a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement and say their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong's lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people attend and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could hurt the investment.
Chinese state media have also come forward in recent days with reports portraying Hong Kong’s democratic activists as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
Pre-election agitator?
The League in Jihlava is named after a political movement
About 1,600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
And their highest competition is now called Together for the Jihlava League.
It was named after a movement that is going to the October municipal elections.
In addition, Jan Mráka, the head of the small football team in Jihlava, is the tenth candidate.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with that," Mráka said.
The situation around the Little Football League has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended changing the system of distribution of subsidies.
According to the city’s website, Little Football won around a million crowns last year.
This year it is also in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small football is not contrary to the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the municipality.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express as a small football support in the elections of one political party, this probably will not be possible.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come for high-level "big" football.
That there should be a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1.
And the class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from among companies to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrzá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football of the other party and the movement in the name of the league will not let
According to small football players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own complex with six playgrounds, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách playground is not ours, we are rented there," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> ml<0xC3><0xBD>n.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mrák said.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football field uses artificial grass fields in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ického and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that make the most of them.
We are planning to modernize or build sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been tremendous progress in recent years for the small football," Vymazal added.
Other political parties will not appear in league names, according to Jan Mráka.
We have restrictions.
If someone from one industry enters our partnership, we don’t put the other one there anymore,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the city council's sports commission.
"Let the voters assess whether Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jet plane
We are pleased to be able to respond to demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression when arriving at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its own security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to bringing our very important fresher (VIF) options to students this year to ensure that they arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the services have only just started, they do not have any reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve this.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic necessities.
Feminists protest against racism and police behaviour in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prioritize gender over race.
With rising tensions in the Midwest drawing national attention, Perez noticed that white women’s reactions were 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the Aug. 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as “White Woman’s Thoughts on Ferguson” or “Feminism Is Not Just About Oppressing Women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at this level," she said.
People felt they had to speak up about what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially defined that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 characters from people all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about colored people being trapped in their own country, it’s deafening silence.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about safety in a public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford luxury to clearly divide these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Even though white women today combine race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for nearly all cases of rape of a white woman,” she said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
“They decided to bet on the voting rights for women and the right for blacks to focus later,” Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
Mitchell said the surge in white feminist responses to the issues that have arisen in Ferguson — the issue of police conduct, racial discrimination — reflects a time when white feminists have had to “catch up” on issues that black women have struggled with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these spaces took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists who have made careers by fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead by a Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and views on race that vary widely in opinion polls — will seek change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but comments by Steinem’s side of Ferguson face criticism it has provoked before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother’s Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it provoked an angry response from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. Border Patrol detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform has resurfaced – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to bring the issue up as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"It speaks for itself," Mercad says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are echoed in women's organizations," she said.
Habitation of pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
A one-room detached house for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000 stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which the pig rests with his head on the sofa.
The Connells real estate agency said the pig in the photo is the owners’ pet.
"The photo was taken by mistake and has now been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In property records, Connells described the former prayer house as a "single detached one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig is included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in south-east Perth, with one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery campaign.
Traffic at Harvey was lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 it was a $1 million win.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win was being talked about by the entire city in southwest Perth.
This is the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought that such a win was to the touch.
Eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains don't leave at night.
Motorists want higher wages.
In a statement, the GDL described the protest as a warning strike for which it deliberately chose off-peak time.
At the time of the strike, the GDL takes into account the many people who return by rail on the weekend only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people commuting to work during the day," the union said in a statement Monday morning announcing the strike.
"Our first strike should hit primarily freight, less so passengers," the GDL added.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike.
It is also unclear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in the wages of train drivers and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept wage growth while reducing working hours.
They stress that the drivers’ salary assessment must develop in the same way as for other railway staff, for whom DB does not count the reduction of the working week.
There was a risk that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum Rallye ended.
What exactly happened?
It was a defect in the material.
The car was brand new, so I didn’t think anything like this would happen.
Couldn’t the exhaust be repaired provisionally and continue at a slower pace to the service station, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we still had two more heresies waiting for us, and we couldn't do that.
It has a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've completed five stages at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over the wint.
Everything was due to the fact that we had been bugging the car for more than half a year to be on some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
Work didn't come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, technology has said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops to retire prematurely from the fight for the championship.
Foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also dropped out.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites have dropped out?
Yes, sir.
It was a shame, especially for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Tarabus, for whom you are preparing a car, also moved to the top for a long time.
But he paid the price of taking off from the track and taking a nearly two-minute shortfall.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the stages of the winners.
I mean, he used to do the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He drove really fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of riding make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year I said that Barumka is my last race and I still did not keep it.
I decided to ride her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance in a year, I'll probably go for it.
But there's nothing else I'm thinking about.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, it was because of them that we started.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do too much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the fabia of Honza S<0xC3><0xBD>kora from us for this race.
With Mira we are waiting for a European doubles race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you make a suggestion?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you reached your highest point in the series with the fifth place.
Don’t you want to try the tracks again?
He's not.
An oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a certificate of incapacity from your doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that these days would be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was only verbal.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have written confirmation of the employer's consent to the use of leave, in practice this procedure has proven itself.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the use of leave, as in your case, can be denied and absence from work can be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, which is the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a court dispute about an agreement with the employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been terminated in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, you only have the given days listed on the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. the inability to receive material security in unemployment), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you re-visit the doctor and have a written confirmation that there was indeed an injury, as a result of which you were incapacitated (this is not a so-called "incapacitated", it is only a doctor's certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as early notification to the employer or requesting written consent to take leave.
This will avoid any possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on the way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart only a short distance behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tire broke in the 172nd lap, and the race was over for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car to the garage, did not express himself to reporters and left.
His team boss Chad Johnston said the team was disappointed but would now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope to do better there.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch, requiring repairs to the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to go.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who ran into Stewart's path during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, working his way up to 10th at the start of the race and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, drove out of the second corner and hit Stewart's, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague chooses new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new managers of taxi stations.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, for the same places for drivers of taxis annually collected 150 thousand crowns.
This was reported by the councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used a draw when selecting administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a lump sum of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently being decided.
"One year after the cancellation of the original leases and the start of tenders, the new lease system has proven to be far more advantageous and fairer for Prague overall," the councilor said.
The Most Expensive Spot Is On The Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n
The highest price was offered by those interested in the location in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B> street.
It will pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by the councilors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease contracts.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and 29 sites were found by the new administrator.
This is the second time this year we have had to clean the well.
We released it every time, which created almost a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured the Sava.
Incredible smell!
Our well in the cellar always provided enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, my grandfather carved it with his own help.
A long time ago.
It was only about three circles and overall peculiar, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, the water didn’t smell.
We wondered if something had fallen in there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a little bad luck, there the plate was quite unreachable, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
On the ground lay a glued package with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a dazed mouse.
At the ceiling, where the vents are, Grandpa's invention, there were fish leftovers!
And hard-hitting!
Our cellar is also unique.
Some would say that Grandpa just dug up the hut.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just suffocated sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
They mainly ship there.
And the car.
And sun loungers on the beach.
The wide-gap door was mostly open, as someone walked in and out.
At the ceiling a few of the already mentioned vents.
No net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the beams.
There is no need to mention mice.
My grandfather wanted it to go up, and it did.
Now, however, even the luft did not help.
The whole basement smelled.
We also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the rafter was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, a heraclitus board, and so on.
Our cottage greeted the passers-by from a distance with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering, who could have put the disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
She'd have a hard time coming to our diner.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who was not well.
Is he the Franta who put us through that shit?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to look after the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests are finished, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
One day, we heard a terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The slit leaped over her and squeaked like a madman.
Her mother scolded her because she thought Reza had dug a waste hose out of the sink.
But suddenly the hose partially rolled into a ball and partially straightened.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
The cut had a hysterical fit.
We ran down.
The snake, well over a metre long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Reza prevented it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the badger saw the surplus in the form of our whole family, she probably thought that we should eat her when we were so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the vent to the cellar.
We went to see her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we noticed another smelly package on her record.
It smells like fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a shader.
And we locked the cellar during the day.
I don't...
We went outside and each of us lay down next to one of the vents.
We didn't wait long.
Behind the wells, it was a sham.
First there was a flat head with yellow marigolds on its neck.
Then the whole thing came up on the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to tap into it.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops from the company and sold them
A disgruntled employee bought computers from the company after his release and then sold them.
The money was spent before the police were arrested.
In a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"He took the laptops after the takeover to Olomouc, where he sold them at bazaars," said Rostislav Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner, chief commissioner of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk police.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for the dismissal and also the profit of money.
"He told us during the interrogation that he had used the money to pay off the loans," Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner said.
The police also found that the fraudster was a pathological gambler who was repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in the winning machines or in the video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we did not find any money from him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who was once convicted of theft, now faces between one and five years in prison.
Police have not yet said whether the punishment also threatens the bazaars, who bought laptops below the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar has yet been charged.
Come on, one more time, you can do it or as I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared a few changes for us.
The biggest change was the change of route, which brought the target to the river instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we photographed and filmed videos together.
To bring my perspective from the other side to perfection, I took on the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend Katya, just before the start, we obediently placed ourselves at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who were passing us in the section for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of jumpers to warm up, turn on the sport testers, countdown and start!
Screams of exultation, but instead of a quick start was followed by a knock at the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the meter and run at a pace of ten o'clock.
We intertwine with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad almost a kitschy touch.
The pulsating flesh stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague was running here.
On the embankment between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it traditionally begins to show who has how much power.
A slight hill on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> Square forces many runners to slow down or go on a walk.
Just before the run to the Theatre I see a police escort and immediately behind him flies V<0xC3><0xAD>tek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta at an incredible pace to the finish.
I hear the admiring sigh of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's about to slap me, but just before that, my leg gets twitched and our hands just slip by.
The descent of the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I can't breathe, and my legs almost carry me.
There is a moment of truth behind the first snack bar.
When crossing the road, Katya squints at the curb and shows the jump smoothly.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It rises and continues along Goat Street, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but still it is necessary to follow the surroundings well.
I do not know yet that the concept of the narrowest place will acquire its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate, we are frantically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Katya to do the same, because ten claps with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are accelerating again and although we have fallen significantly, now the pursuit has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
There's no one ahead of us for the last refreshment, we're accelerating.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to work hard.
The sun has slowly set and the ending day symbolically ends the race.
The last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight line to the finish.
The pace we're running, I wonder where it's coming from in that girl.
"Come on, we're going under 13 o'clock, we're working!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and here's the target.
Hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes on schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kate's legs are breaking, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
Euphoria does not allow us to think of the crowd in the doorways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat's Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
This is up here behind the finish line, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners stuffed to burst.
If someone doesn’t like crowds, this is not the place for them.
After a while, I lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what is happening in the destination.
From my own experience I know that organizing a race is no fun.
If you add ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was transferred among the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when running in the city centre, there are obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of the mass race in a place that is bordered by a wall on one side and a river on the other as the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I rate it as very good.
In the end, I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write us in the discussion if you liked the route and what do you think about the situation in the finish line.
Prison Guards in Bulgaria Organise Protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Justice Ministry in the capital, Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The guards of the month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the prison guards’ unions and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“Discussions are still ongoing,” Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of Prison Services, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Workers’ Trade Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protests.
Why the Universe Can Have More Dimensions and We Can't See Them
Physicists usually don't write best-sellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University did in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for the layman to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists today deal with - an effort to unify two brilliantly working but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that finding a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between two key theories (for at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to the layman.
In addition, Greene had handled the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he could not be blamed for not including so much of it in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
The author probably wouldn’t mind if his book aged faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter the Greene non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
However, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more mundane, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine stretching a hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scene from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you will easily notice a long hose stretched in a horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer from sharp vision, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you will answer with only one information: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometer, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we magnify everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clockwise hands", i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where there is a coiling hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (Note: Experts note that this chapter focuses purely on the failure theory of strings.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easy to see.
The size of the enveloping circumference of the hose is short, "curved" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
The above example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, curled and much less visible.
Of course, in the above case, we did not exactly overdo it in order to reveal the "curved" dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.
I had to get a telescope to help me.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal the coiled dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he argued with the astounding idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions that we all know.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by saying that the extra dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this observation of Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has three large, large and easily visible dimensions, the existence of which we are aware at every moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, tightly rolled into a space so small that they have remained hidden from our most advanced experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluza's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that we draw a fairly dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the curved dimension even easier, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, four-dimensional together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let us note the illustration in Fig. 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of space in the same way as we enlarge the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have extra dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are folded into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle is a new, tiny and curved dimension.
Just like loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them only to the intersections in a square network for the sake of clarity.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - at such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following pictures, we focus on the small area of the previous picture; we enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
But as we move on to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circular, coiled dimension, similar to strings in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every location in the direction of large dimensions, much like a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, it is much more difficult to recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe obvious, large and extensive dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our state-of-the-art magnification tools.
But the most important thing is that the extra dimension is not just a round bump inside normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension independent of the other three dimensions, just as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right, and front-rear are independent of (and perpendicular to) each other.
A sufficiently small ant would be able to move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual still position in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller curved dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the extra circular dimension could be about one Planck length, a size far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluza-Klein theory.
Wohnut Honza Homola advises how to practice on an electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-point harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone who is interested in musical theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola a.k.a. Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
Education puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, since graduation twenty years ago, lives as a graphic designer.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnut, from which, unfortunately, it is not possible to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as is Brother Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j, the leader of the Wohnuts.
Start your training on a single string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen to and watch Honza, what can be invented with twelve harmonies on two strings and how nice it is starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, watch out for the tuning change, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonic and you will try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
As best as possible, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the big celebration, recognizes Hradec Dvorak
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
Were you not nervous when he played, yet he was accompanied by a great whistling?
I didn’t notice it much, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You scored a penalty after half an hour, but you also got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, there was a corner and then a penalty.
After that you got up and in the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
Hard to tell.
I agree that we played well after the goal we scored until the break.
In the cabin we thought we wanted to keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn’t.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the hosts said something about their game, probably they were not very happy with it.
You have scored on the opponent’s field for the first time, while you may not have scored a goal at home yet.
Why is there such a difference?
I don't think it's that different, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plze<0xC5><0x88>, that’s a different category.
Four matches you were waiting for a goal, you were not afraid that after the last match it could be similar?
Probably not, but of course we are glad that since the last match we do not have to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
A lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun region near the Vatnaj<0xC3><0xB6>kull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometer-long crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel.
This is what scientists are most concerned about...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, moreover, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the J<0xC3><0xB6>kulsa á Fj<0xC3><0xB6>llum river and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption, there is a strong smell of sulfur, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
This is definitely not a tourist-friendly eruption, as was the case with the Fimmv<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>uháls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger, and there are much more gases," says volcanologist Armann H<0xC3><0xB6>skuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange grade (second highest) for Bár<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and the yellow (third) for Askja apply.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on wings
A flying day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, Peggy Valentino, an acrobat, climbed out of the cockpit and into the upper wing of the biplane, as well as between the wings.
There, it relies only on the strength of the muscles.
The aviation day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting aviation pieces.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing cover.
Wingwalking is an acrobatics that originated in the United States.
After the First World War, many former pilots tried to enforce it.
Due to the high number of deaths, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of air days.
After the start, Peggy climbs out of the cockpit onto the top wing.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the following performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter jet came to the surface with Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so-called on the numbers).
Such a lineup could be seen for the first time by aviation fans in the Czech Republic.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone a breathtaking aerobatics with a plane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was in the Army Reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
Like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
At the same place there is also another pearl of the Cheb air day, the Beechcraft C45H Expeditor twin-engine.
At the airport, he couldn't miss the big machine.
Its polished aluminum cover shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force was also admired.
A small airliner jumped behind the recanted Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from the German Hof to the flying day.
German neighbours demonstrated in Cheb with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-member formation of B<0xC3><0xBC>cker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhyová: A dramatic return to the camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borhy traded her parental worries for the work ones.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously does not know any of this.
Moderating the TV news was going well for her, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months!
It’s only been two weeks since the blonde ended the six-week period, during which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not regularly appear in the main news program of TV Nova.
According to Blesk.cz, a regular return is expected in a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda now needs her more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen, and it was a hit in the black.
Exhibitions a year in Prague?
Hall would sell out, planning a farewell Jagr
It would be great if something like this could happen during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition entitled Golden Match, in which the impressive Nagan team met again.
Even the players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, it is possible to find one or two days during the tournament when there is complete freedom and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell it to Gum (Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>légr) or B<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x8F> <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (organizer of the Jihlava match), who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I fly in like that...
But you don’t want to play in the national team.
Or did the meeting in Jihlava somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and in representation are decisive performances.
One thing is, people would love to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players was great.
The man revived the stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing, however, was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it is good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavom<0xC3><0xAD>r Lener, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echmánek on the alternator.
Can you remember your first game?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames, and three young people: me, Robert Hol<0xC3><0xAD>k and Robert Reichel, joined the three of us.
It was everyone’s first start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, we can't say that.
Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek caught in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
I'll never be surprised by Hashan on ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can’t (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized Jagra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
He also did a great job.
He was training with me one night, and he was a bit of a pain in the ass.
And now he's catching it fabulously.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, football players start qualifying
Prominent guests came to the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, national team coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the figure in the black cap, that's Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around half past twelve among the last.
We have a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be happy?” he said when he appeared in front of a journalist in the national team.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday 1st September: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autographiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná)
Fans can support Rosicky and Co. before Wednesday's match against the United States (20:15).
The national team has opened Tuesday training for them, which starts at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which neither Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> nor the Czechs will miss.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
This is what Vrba’s coach praises, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to focus on.
Now we are going to focus on the Netherlands.
There is an advantage when you have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have never been done before," said Vrba, who has been leading the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The national team has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
She drew 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results have not yet been significant.
Not until now.
The match against the Netherlands will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could manage a general against the USA.
The first half of the year was to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player in the 23-man nomination to have health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he didn’t make it to Wednesday’s game against the U.S., coach Vrba would have called in another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A woman in Britain describes how she thought she would die after being misdiagnosed for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she had only a few years left to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest as motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA), a disease with a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be strapped to a wheelchair and dead by the time she was thirty.
A mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
Every day I fell and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and had several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor’s departure from the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was spying, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered, I was in shock, completely panicked.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen I would be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my faculties.
I was all alone and planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up and hugged her and said, “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, or you’d be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening.”
After passing several genetic tests, he was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turn of the economy, taxes rise
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local taxes on firms in the country have risen slightly over the past year, with firms in Washington no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined contributed $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, a 3.8 percent increase over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Tax burdens – state and local – rose 4.3% to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9% last year, the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were cut.
According to a study conducted by professional firm Ernst & Young and political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3%, than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from trade taxes, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 percent, has the least tax revenue from business.
The researchers say that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to firms, which this year for three consecutive years with growth of -1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2% year-on-year from $9.6 billion in 2012.
The apparent increase in the value of real estate, however, is not so much driving up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business income also seems to be increasing.
Companies in the region have published a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland's corporate income taxes raised $1 billion, the most in the region.
Although they are heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below the average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three counties (all with the same tax rate), at 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study didn't evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering the corporate tax rate from 6.9% to 6%, just like Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax — the structure of compensating for cost increases by raising prices under which most businesses are organized — in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia rose 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and nationwide trade tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total tax revenues from sales to state and local governments rising to 6.2 percent compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may lag behind others because cutting government spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin’s Novorossia and Lafat’s scissors
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government units have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
According to him, the support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions on Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose a form of further strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided on Tuesday night.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new president of the European Union.
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit as the head of the European Council, the so-called EU president who heads the summits of the member states.
Herman Van Rompuy will be replaced by Herman Van Rompuy in December.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman who will become Vice-President of the future European Commission has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it is not talked about.
Helping an incurable and long-suffering patient with his death?
In the Czech Republic, where the law does not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
Nevertheless, the statements of the doctors who addressed the LN show that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The most difficult chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) about three hundred people, 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in Motol in Prague.
We don’t know 100% if it will be successful.
But if we don’t try, we won’t find out,” says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
It's the CIA's handwriting, they needed a war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
“The severe sanctions that were announced in view of the downing of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army,” he said.
According to the lawmaker, the CIA's handwriting is also known from this.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and parties are once again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are racing to see who the voters like best.
The server Lidovky.cz has selected unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
Seventy years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A fierce siege began.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka constantly asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally complied, and included this ground unit as one of its forces during the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Don’t rush anywhere and get some sleep.
The last days of vacation are upon us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage at a normal work pace can be a chore for many.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: do not rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: 'We keep our fingers crossed'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has said she has not lost hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're holding her thumbs.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services saying she suffered a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy in the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious".
Reactions have not been long in coming, including incredible online support from celebrities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by headlines
That the media distort the reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me a lot lately, the more apt the word annoys me.
This applies in particular to the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headline reads, “Israel Attacks Gaza.”
Only in the text you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
The headline reads, “Both Sides Violated the Armistice.”
Does the journalistic community realize that it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans of “Jewish swine” and similar atrocities, I was shocked.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews they were destined for the destruction of the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please give a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdog of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided to liquidate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
You may also want to consider one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go to their “own” countries, like Gaza, the answer is, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch healthcare (I have seen firsthand how the top private Hadassah Hospital, which is funded by the sponsorship of Jews from all over the world, is regularly visited and treated by Arabs).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform them that Hamas aims to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of the world’s terrorist organizations.
Please be informed that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area may have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, which the Gaza governors do not pay for, and are even upset that power supplies are sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate into Israeli territory, but in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Information’s claim Monday morning: An online retailer – a video producer and hundreds of other things – is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for one billion seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was set to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players to stream games online – in Business Insider’s words, “YouTube for live streaming.”
Twitch interface.
On YouTube, there are already popular "Let's play" videos, the kind where mudrlants (mostly older) give the games a remake of the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to the fore a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch did not excite anyone, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn’t work out even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Emmet Shear, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us achieve it faster.
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch them, it’s hard to understand what’s so great about playing games instead of just watching them.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder at 3:00 a.m. playing Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 shots to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s, most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Rogers Banners of our electronic age complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of play or humor, their Twitch channel probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is the fourth-highest on the Internet.
How will Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it would have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: the hordes of young men advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of gaming” and the media doesn’t seem to be reluctant, even as – swallowed – viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy scriptures are the word of God."
Original video attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that go against their religion, they often ask us the question: Who are you going to believe?
The Word of God or the Word of Man?
It is as if human investigation is completely worthless compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who added further lines of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It's like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts pretending to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "motivated" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but these texts were written by no one but mere mortals with some degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an <0xC3><0xBC>ber-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would not have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into more and more separate denominations seeking disputable truths, each claiming in some way divine guidance, regardless of the continuing divergence and separation in each direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, the Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Zarathustra Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia Book are all believed to be the only "absolute truth" and "true boha.
The only logical explanation is probably that to some extent everyone is wrong.
None of the above books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of Western Michigan.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (defences) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
Therefore, they cannot be said to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies—each of which may also contain prophecies that were not fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often biased politically motivated authors, thereby explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He’s right that Genesis has more than one author, and it’s certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e., the five Books of "Moses" and do not attribute any of them to Moses, since he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Doceti and the Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in some kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these changes refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Jewish religion, the New Testament authors decided to ridicule him, and Ba'al Zebul was changed to Beelzebub's "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible has been deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century CE in a series of commission decisions at the Diet of Nicaea.
The four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple show of hands, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the canon thus evolved out of the bond of the early church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to the books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items, we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved, if God were the real author of this haphazard mixture of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by very enlightened people, quite the contrary!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it may be, from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How can anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.

To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
However, creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why is that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, the one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God’s “work” as “worshiping creation instead of the creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God Himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that a god could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it’s a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they are HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that men have approved or rejected in their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere erring men.

The participant of the bucket challenge dislocated her jaw
When she poured ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom screamed, damaging the structure of her facial bones.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed during a bucket call by dislodging her jaw.
While she was pouring ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged the structure of the bones in her face.
"The water was so cold that I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.

Attacker stabs nine people at Chinese school, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China News Agency, violently broke into an elementary school building in the morning and attacked it around 11:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen was later killed by a high-altitude jump, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many couples have only one child in line with government policies.
Zeman showed first graders in Lány how he had to sit at school
The youngest students were taken to their classroom, where they waited with the teacher for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone at school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that is not what awaits you, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first-graders puzzles as a gift.

Nova's New Art Director Is David Fiala
David Fiala has been the new Art Director of News and Publicity for Nova TV since September 1.
He will replace Alan Záruba, who led the creative department of the entire Nova Group from 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of the Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has participated in the realization of a complete visual transformation of the news reports of Television News, Strepiny, Prásk! and other journalistic programs of Nova TV.
David Fiala has a very good command of the synergy of communication between the editorial staff, studio management and the graphics department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the path we want to take in the visuals of Nova’s news,” says Nova’s creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, naked photos of celebrities were leaked to the public
Screenshot with a list of leaked files
An anonymous user posted nude and pornographic images of American celebrities on 4chan, according to Mashable.com.
He allegedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the pictures as fake, but several of the affected pictures have already admitted authenticity.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played, for example, in Lethal Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos for enrichment.
U.S. magazines have reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but 4chan reports that the hacker prefers to get money from the community.
According to the server The Next Web, it is very likely that this is indeed a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub that made it possible to obtain passwords for user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool worked, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their Apple ID password.
What matters is the length of the password, not its complexity.
Suitable length is at least 12 characters.
The leak of nude images of celebrities should be considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times better secured than computers in homes or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it only runs on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in a timely manner, and most importantly, you will have space to delete failed images, so they will not unnecessarily take up space in online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet are offered to the readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valá<0xC5><0xA1>ek in PDF format.
A Smart Way to Save on College Scripts
Since the price of a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an up-and-coming second-year student came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from senior classmates, offering nominal compensation to delay their resale.
“I got the math book, which normally costs $180, for ten a semester and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
Spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options for coping with these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s are becoming the preferred choice for students.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the semester book often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookshops on campus, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
The survey shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Neebo’s vice president Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Shops, less than half of all textbooks are purchased at university bookstores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $ 290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy it on Chegg.com, in a retail store specializing in textbooks, a new one for $ 239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind other people’s comments or wear and tear, the teaching texts used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, “Calculus” sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” on Amazon.com.
The new one sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not significant for the work in the seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering renting textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about $20 a semester.
Learn the terms and conditions of the store where you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlights, or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends Calculus for six months for about $61.
Thus, according to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, since many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He saw it for himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found in the well a torso of rifles from the end of the war
The well is a short walk from St. George's Church.
We discovered the vegetation around and began to pull out the age-old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we hit a barrel," Radomil Novák said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found that it was the torso of an attacking German rifle used by the SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novak added.
All wooden structural things have decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
But her body is preserved - she keeps her shape.
How did you end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't have done it.
They were throwing weapons in the woods,” the finder said.
The rifle was the only thing the Rainbow Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>ky movement had found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully groped the mud so that some kind of disaster did not happen, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find will end up in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet freed a prisoner of the Czech Republic
Exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... they're calling me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, the director of the POW Liberation Center, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
Colonel-General Vladimir Ruban in a televised debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they were—or should be—that Ruban specified with his counterpart on the other end of the telephone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Just yesterday - when we were negotiating an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number at 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners of war during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not yet the Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who are joining the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers will capture them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after questioning, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they believe they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists – and among them, perhaps, a Czech – they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
Q. And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say that it has already exceeded a hundred men.
We have long since stopped counting how many people we have helped.
But we only liberated them... not saved them from the war if they decided to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we are not.
That's it.
And every day more and more are added.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a simple human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How have you managed to build the respect of both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe that captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers Corps, I had gained some authority earlier.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or for the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even being taken prisoner in a prisoner exchange... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
Q: How many executions and tortures do you know about?
... (long pause)... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
This is only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There is no indication that the Ukrainian military is doing anything like this.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can’t give the numbers and I don’t want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and maybe democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists are already fed up with oligarchs and are their implacable opponents - to life and death.
As we say, they ate them up to their throats.
The same dreams and desires, by the way, were also manifested on the Maidan.
And now I am speculating a little: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other one to be small.
This sentence of mine, however, contains an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, what do you think of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and I show soldiers or militants my bare hands.
And they always have me on both sides of the 200 or 300 meters on the fly or in the optical sight.
I can always see the faces of the people pointing at me... and they can pull the trigger at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters – in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times the fear.
Why, then, should I hide my opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk "the rabbit".
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal from which to fear or have respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly mimics the behavior of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament in a war, to beg for it, to play tricks on it, to threaten to resign... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, rest on weeping emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Jacenuk?
She acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he doesn't fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
Sylvester Stallone’s expendable 3 returned less than $30 million from the $90 million budget in the U.S. and Sin City: The Woman I Would Kill For returned only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz grossed just $14.6 million in its first weekend, and movies for kids like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in The Telegraph, the quality of children’s films is to blame.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year for children's films, and How to Train Your Dragon 2 as a "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer movie premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality as last year's hits.
According to some commentators, the change in audience access and the higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to accept it and not try to chase after what has already been.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood box office blockbuster movies, Netflix’s Internet-enabled earnings reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book rights and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In the light of the current collapse, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the release of possible big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimo<0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0xAF> and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply “cyclical.” He told the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about sales.”
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for an invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
A South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
In the province, there is an underground launch pad for Scud missiles.
It is another in a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people showed up at Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police at about eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed overnight with them and were picked up Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek had the win on his leg
The 23-year-old forward could decide, but he failed in his two biggest chances.
After the goal, the main shot called close to three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended on the goalkeeper Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>a.
I had it on my feet, I had to give it a chance.
I'm angry at myself," he said, throwing ashes on his head.
"I should have put it under the lid a little bit," he mused.
Sigma's defense didn't let Opava do much of it, except for Mikul's 11-minute incursion, which was covered by Reichl's goalie.
Then they began to push the Hanáci, but the chances are in the block defending the home was not allowed and missiles from a distance caught Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
We spent 15 minutes comparing, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more out of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vas<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek didn’t change his chances, so it ended 0-0,” said Hanák coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvod.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the line-up, where in addition to the two injured were missing Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k with a three-goal scorer Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are guests in Silesia from Sigma.
Contrary to their previous policies, they were not allowed to enter.
The substitutes deserve a discharge.
Sigma looked more footballing, but we didn’t let it work except for one standard,” Slezan<0xC3><0xBA> coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness.
I think the draw is deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got to four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who after the defeat with Znojmo conditioned his millionth deposit in the cashier diametrically different performances in subsequent matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so it can't be that the boys don't want to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the address of the sleeping gunman, Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek: "I believe it will come and when he gives a goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first goal, I will replace him immediately so that he can save goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice been to Venice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González I<0xC3><0xB1>árritu suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days indicated that interest in the 71st Venice Festival had somewhat declined.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed, but less appealing, images like the documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s The View of Silence and other social-themed films, from American 99 homes to Iranian Tales, have been released.
Heroes of the Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and it has allegedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute place in a hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has affected such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but present only in the context of films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of the representatives of the comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino became the main event.
He also appeared in two films.
In the out-of-competition story of Insight, directed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison from the novel by Philip Roth, the 74-year-old has a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of his fame who suffers from depression at the end of both his career and his personal life.
But to see him the very next day as an odd-looking hardware store owner from a rural town in the David Gordon Green film Manglehorn was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Performance by an Actor should not be missed - but does the Pacino-format artist still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and that of the Italian in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims the land from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
In fact, this year’s Italian film is doing very well in Venice.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first film to receive a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen as a view of family relationships between clans that fight for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and actors.
He was also interested in the chamber psychothriller Hungry Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who, with her misguided anxiety, almost kills her own child.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not receive a warm reception, neither the Ransom for Glory, nor 3 hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, namely Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival shots have depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film, She’s Funny That Way, an out-of-competition comedy set in Venice and filmed in the style of 1940s American merry-go-rounds, managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police caught four producers of methamphetamine in Prague, drugs drove from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who from last November until this August produced and sold methamphetamine in Prague 9," police spokeswoman Jana R<0xC3><0xB6>ssler said in a statement.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlarska Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was a drug buyer in Poland and a dose seller in the group.
The next day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, on the basis of the prior consent of the public prosecutor.
The last of the four policemen were found on Wednesday morning, August 20, at the premises of the Male<0xC5><0xA1>ice incinerator," the spokeswoman said.
For the transport of medicines from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of activities.
In the workshop of the Letensk area, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vova street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced methamphetamine, supplied various tools and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He then weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags and sold methamphetamine.
He was assisted in transporting drugs from Poland or selling them to drug addicts by a 25-year-old woman who had not been punished yet.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," R<0xC3><0xB6>ssler added.
Criminals also carried out several house searches on the basis of a judge’s order, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, injection syringes, hoses and other aids and items that, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been fined seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times for property crimes since 1995, and the woman had not been sentenced," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was conditionally convicted of a sexual abuse offence in 2006 and the 37-year-old auto mechanic, who is being prosecuted at large, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator finally filed a motion with the public prosecutor for the imposition of detention, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as that of the other defendants.
Police are still working with the man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things as part of its other products for a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, in Italy, handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board will serve as a good example.
If you like it, prepare more than 40 000 CZK.
The exact price is 43,405 CZK.
The customer will receive a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
It is probably not surprising that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse.
If chess doesn’t seem like a valuable enough gift to you, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (manually, of course) in a scale of 1:1,8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disruption of grammar schools and secondary schools does not make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that gymnasts have good employment.
The start of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in the schools over the last 14 days.
These are usually routine matters, such as transferring pots from the summer store back to the classrooms and stuffing chalk.
They're gonna have a little bit more fun at the high school in Gorizia.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private one.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
“The French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says a key ally of Francois Hollande.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to “show its support” for the militantly-minded socialist president, whose new distribution of power has not met with the approval of a majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, clapping his hands.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France’s controversial 35-hour work week, despite passionate speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who earlier this week proposed loosening the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain “cohesive” with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubir drew a line at him over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for having "lost faith in the future" because of her.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the ultra-conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is also naked, and they were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last even until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call to dissolve Parliament, saying she was convinced it could win an early election and was ready to lead the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extreme conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion needs to think that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new leadership of the capital.
Other playrooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will also be no restrictions on dog walking.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in the parliament before the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling on their territory.
But the games will not disappear, the decree on gambling will not change yet.
This is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we wouldn’t even technically be able to do that given, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current parliament, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
The referendum on the general ban on gambling is being prepared on the day of the municipal elections in the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, there is a ban on gambling, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal for places to the City Hall, is particularly complaining about this, which it would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of And<0xC4><0x9B>l.
The decree regulating the walking of dogs the city is preparing for several months, it is not yet completed.
The location of the halls and busking issues are dealt with by city ordinances.
They can be issued or edited only by the representative office of the capital city.
Town Halls have only an advisory voice, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed a victory for Scottish independence proponents at his fingertips.
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making that mistake a third time, when it nearly placed the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich on billboards across Scotland.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect by threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to drive the money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond is well aware of this, and has repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he is willing to respect the “sovereign will of the Scottish people” if Scottish voters vote for independence, and to start promoting a single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
However, the debate about what kind of currency Scotland will have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, the job opportunities and the defence of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling backed London bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of healthcare.
As Salmond put it, “he got into bed with the Conservatives.”
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent-minded housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland can be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it causes him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: the Scots should not jump out and must accept what is.

The end was the best of the holidays, the last week, which was no longer going anywhere and we just lay back and wandered with Grandma's summer, the silence before the storm, the peace before the stress.
New clothes, when you could get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
The reading of the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, the whistling of a mountain bike around the Imperial to the rear behind Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun stroked its back and shoulders, tapped the rays of farewell.
In the evening, a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep until half-past eleven, in a week it will be worse, moments before falling asleep they stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up in the morning at half-past seven.
Monday's coming.
Usually it doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer sneers maliciously in front of the school.
The school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A., is there to p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>lo<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xAD> in a ghostly light on a square and to feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight.
Zápotock<0xC3><0xBD> with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more drawn, girls more busty.
There's scumbags out there, to avoid them, just as it's interesting how unmistakably they stick together and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls, who came screaming, are laughing hysterically at something right now, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same with me.
And new first-years, some nervous and others delighted, why do they come here at all?
Because they have to, compulsory military education.
So inside, the cold dampness of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with a mop, unfortunately still the same one who lends the student a key to the tin box where textbooks can be left and there are still so few of them.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in memory, now it does not happen, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just the idea of the stomach getting cramped and the head starting to hurt.
A head that will take the math lesson even worse, that diabolical game for the chosen ones, among whom I do not belong and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, God forbid the fives, hide from testing, fit into the bench and best sublimate, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream up stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space, where no one competes with anyone, no one competes with anyone, no one competes with anyone.
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's only day one, just like it was years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She faces an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the cabin of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without outside help, she gave birth to a little girl, whom she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting the umbilical cord, hid under a jacket and carried to a road feeder, where she laid it in the bushes located a few tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I had to go to the bathroom, where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the cord with the scissors I wore to school," she said, adding that she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
“The next day she returned to the scene, put the child’s body in her backpack and drove it away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother’s house in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov Brod,” the lawsuit states, noting that it is not entirely clear when the death occurred.
It could have been tens of minutes, or even hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or inserted under a jacket, hypothermia, or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, at an undetermined time from February to April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in the Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ko Brod region, gave birth to herself secretly.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without verifying that she was born alive, without cutting and ligating the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Eventually, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of his partner.
Even for this reason, he is not now in court, only he was punished for a sin against the law on burial.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He was manipulating the baby against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not the right one, but it came to me at that moment as a human one," the defendant did not hide her indignation, which allegedly was subject to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears came to her eyes as she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she had left when she came of age.
She didn’t want to kill.
“They come to see me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn’t buy equipment because I didn’t want children, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can’t explain it to you,” she said to the judge.
However, she refused to act with the intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, she said, was born dead.
Even during pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I have limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I’ve also cut down on smoking,” she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible on her in both cases, she told everyone, even on repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was dehydrated.
Even my friend.
The main hearing at the Hradec Králové court will continue on Tuesday with the statements of court experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened with a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, possibly an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise Closes to $3 Billion Acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise ship operator in the world, has advanced in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
Trade by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company that competes with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but warned that negotiations still might not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the meetings were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Headquartered in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The $22 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies are competing to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007, when it closed a deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its present form since 2000, when it merged with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
As of the end of June, Genting had a 28% equity stake, Apollo had a 20% stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP had an 8% stake.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offerings include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote
A group of people loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates in Hong Kong’s 2017 election should be present.
All candidates must first receive the support of an appointing committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democracy activists to renew their promise and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center with the protests of the “Occupy Central” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tensions, with Chinese leaders worried that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report outlining China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city’s business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be hosted by Premier Li, is being organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Ronghsun, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Offices, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences during the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start talks on “state sovereignty” with eastern Ukraine
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the breakaway areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin’s remark was not intended to imply that areas of eastern Ukraine under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking region would be empowered to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call for the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is consistent with the obvious strategy it has followed since the outbreak of the unrest five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant de facto independence to the newly declared Novorossiya, so that instead of joining the West, it can be linked to Russia.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as “Novorossia” or “New Russia,” a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency has published Putin’s words that a “prisoner of illusion” is anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians have launched campaigns ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government forces are attacking civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal issues, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev’s leadership for several months and is meant to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas about threats to cultural and language rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention by the Kremlin spokesman, who was supposed to correct a “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks, underscored the Russian leadership’s approach to resolving the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population of two million are ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million population are not Russians and opinion polls conducted before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have negotiated in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would link Russia’s mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia’s Rostov and Crimea are also a hub for mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inauguration speech on June 7, proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers — after new elections — consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed another insurgent advance last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far away as Crimea.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical complexes with a population of 500,000, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also implicated in the scandal with the revealed photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greece and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were leaked to the internet in the biggest celebrity photo hack scandal.
The hacker claims to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the iCloud leak, personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece were reportedly leaked to the public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told online newspapers that the hack was “shameless” and those who became its target “feel humiliated”.
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of herself falling apart by the pool.
For example, Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: “This is a clear violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos of hacked phones is just like selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers make up Lébra, even without winning
The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week seems to be a thing of the past.
Even if they brought only a point for goalless draw from Opava in the end.
After all, the club's boss was a little appeased by the commitment and combativeness.
The money for the paychecks could come to the club soon.
"I'm keeping another game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr said, adding that despite not winning, Sigma's players had convinced him with improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment with which we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I can forgive him for not winning.
If we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I’m sure we haven’t lost yet,” Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava passed the initial pressure of the home team, then equalized the game and in the second half it was already better.
After the victory, Kalvod's supporters reached, but did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To our complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one changed chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in the players' attitude was caused only by his threats.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the side of the coach or from the fans," Lébr said.
The pressure must be calculated by Sigma.
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of the way.
I tried not to admit it," young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Václav Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the striker who did not turn Sigma’s biggest opportunity into Saturday’s match, left the question entirely without comment.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
They're all trying to get at us.
Today we showed that if we fight and we all ride our asses, we can do it,” he said.
They took the warnings to heart.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized that, and today you could see that they took Mr. Lebra's warning to heart.
Even before that, it wasn’t about not wanting to fight and flaunting it,” said the Olomouc coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes.
It took us a long time to come to terms with the hardness and realize what the second league was all about.
“It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next matches Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd like to believe that," he added.
