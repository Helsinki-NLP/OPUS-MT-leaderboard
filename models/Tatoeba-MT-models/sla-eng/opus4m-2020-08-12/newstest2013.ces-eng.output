The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders have justified their policy by the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
However, Brennan’s centre refers to such fraud as a myth, with electoral fraud being less common in the United States than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the last ten years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the US, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that have made it difficult for the election process or to enter the election list.
This phenomenon was recorded after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting electoral law in 41 countries were submitted in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph and a document of American state citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the electoral period in advance, invalidate the right to vote on the day of the election and withdraw the electoral right of citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, he did not require any U.S. state to submit an identity card to the voters.
The first State to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law was confirmed in 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this procedure to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have supported the proposals of such laws in 34 countries in order to force voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebek, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age allowing to vote, do not have any identity card with a photograph issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have this identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% under $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age therefore do not have the required identity card with the photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their preference for democratic candidates are not entitled in several states to use their identity card with a photograph exhibited by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required citizenship documents for the elections.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that stipulate the obligation of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It must be noted that two of the three Spanish prefer the democratic side.
In 2011, Republican legislators supported laws in eight states that disrupt the voter registration on the day of the elections.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns helped to register some 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of voters elected in advance were African-Americans, although only 13% were elected in the country.
The Spanish were the same.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, representing 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have taken a very strong stand against the approval of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Democratic governors blocked several draft laws by their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, they managed to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph.
However, the new rules put in place will make the exercise of voting rights completely indisputable in 2012.
Democratic critics are primarily talking about the pre-emptivity of approved laws and consider them to be a clear attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key countries.
The 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the countries where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the assembly of voters needed to win the presidential election.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: to complete the examination or not?
The PSA test resulted in faulty results, which were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has further increased the indifference of men who have already hesitated to go to the examination at all.
Should I be being investigated or not?
We've asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the USA, high levels of contamination among individual tested groups have been shown and it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who had been examined and those who had not.
This study also showed after 12 years of separation that those who do not go to the examination have a 30% to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old examination if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are imprecise.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of risk of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, do not necessarily treat prostate cancer that has no impact on life in the long term, and focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we will propose active supervision and, if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often, we set criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which type not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to interview your doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember has created an instrument that allows to be evaluated for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of illness by adopting healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented if everyone ate healthy and moved well enough.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by inheritance.
Some percent also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes cost 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebek today," he turns his head to André Beaulieu.
Intimidating: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying of cancer decreases by half.
Weight
Telecommunications and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and limb, esophagus, salivary and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Food
That organisation also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid wetlands for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by drying, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet reached clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are controversial according to the SCC.
Although one of them suggests that prostate cancer will be reduced, another study suggests an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about our concerns and precedents in the family with our doctor.
"To undergo an examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson surveyed
The announcement of Higgs Boson's likely discovery sparked a legitimate commotion last summer.
There is a belief that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then it's the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty that it is Higgs's boss.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during a major physical congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all data are still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, suppose it is Higgs’ boss, since the risks of error appear to be small, and let's see what's really going on.
In this world, there is a completely undeniable law that states that two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it is subject to a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to Pauli’s principle.
And on the other end, there are barefoot, sneaky anarchists who don't appreciate anything at all -- definitely not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: meatballs, which we leave undetected here, and "power particles", which spread great natural forces and with which Higgs's boson is probably related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic as you might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "light particles", which is the "bearer" of electromagnetic power.
When particles with an electric charge accelerate or change direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into the pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "strengtheners of power".
A more stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, except that "disrupt" requires a different field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, like the frozen pond level, that only a very large log.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge particle accelerator as an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large clothing accelerator with cordless circuits is a circle with a circuit 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
An analogy with an electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and matter.
The electromagnetic field does not respond to all particles or all materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others will never keep a piece of paper on their own.
And it's also true that with the Higgs field they don't react to all the particles: those that do have a certain amount of matter, while others (such as photon, let's look at it) don't have it.
And Mrs. Nováková is asking what all these research is for, what are they "to us"?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and forecasts of SM.
In addition, few physicists literally wish that they could be found because the smallest difference could open the space of "new physics" and heal some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model still has huge flaws, it brings no explanation of gravity (oh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's matter (again, ooh!).
However, CERN has not yet found such a gap.
Responses
The responses of these studies in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novákov can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be none.
Look at this: At the beginning of the 1960 ’ s, the pioneers had no idea of the revolution in Bell’s labs or of their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said this - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, application can result from all the tools that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan it at first, now serves as the eye of all digital cameras in the world and awarded him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC have to change our lives, but that means that one never really knows...
Palliative Care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission for Dignified Dying, Quebek has recently become involved in a sensitive end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue shortly and the bill is being drafted at the same time.
Much work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to see this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't get ready for this," he adds.
The disease has accomplished its work: an enormous weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom alone or just to eat himself.
She looks away at a delicious breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In a lifetime, one learns that men are standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Going back to the child’s stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person" or whether he accepts the return, the psychologist claims.
According to a number of people involved in palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter their homes with Victor-Gadbois palliative care suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is up to three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who care about them do not provide them with so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear to die "to be strangled in full consciousness".
But the illness allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then she'll let us put a breathing device on her.
Still, they look forward to the final visit of their son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, body care is provided in cooperation with a group of volunteers with the help of nutrition.
That's what palliative care looks like, if there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he may be given a handful of brandy or Pepsi, according to his taste.
Diabetics no longer need to guard their sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
They brought beer to Mr. X last night, who died later last night.
This morning his son will finish his beer to honor his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In Victor-Gadbois' home, they go one by one, but they don't look alike.
In addition to a thirty - nine - year - old man who rejoices at his last encounter with his family, thoroughly based on pillows, while toasting him to his honor, a tragically thirty - year - old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two young children, dies after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"For six months there have always been three or five beds for cancer patients under 45 years of age," Dr Christiane Martel said with concerns.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care intended to alleviate suffering once the patient has reached the final stage of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or at the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Home Palliative Treatment Company in the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of availability of medical care in Quebek that causes a number of doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by tops in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disapproval of such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebek medical system is not efficient enough to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in emergency care in enormous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients should not be asked to die for lack of adequate care.
At the same time, it is true that a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the unfavorable forecast.
Helène Richard's hopes for survival were completely minimal when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, telling us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There's no such thing as all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of those who wish to die thank their nursing doctors for failing to fulfill their wishes when a team of palliative cunts eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Company, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which will be effective until the end of the day, whether by impact or by constant sedation.
It cannot be seen that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who will not be cured of pain will have an ever-increasing opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given sedatives always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia" means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebek
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still talking about what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, unionists and mafias are mixed.
This "discipline" came from the Quebec tax collectors very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has been torn apart since we took fundamental measures," says Ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebek MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It led to a 2011 scandal on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebek, which then was approved by liberal Quebek Prime Minister Jean Charest only after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct link between industry, the opaque financing of the parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the ministry of transport has spared billions of dollars in contracts," when some people held their instincts to gain a stake in them!
Charbonneau's commission "has led to the demission of two mayors," he adds with the hope that it will succeed in "discovering the cunning of some people".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the "Marteau types" officers, who have since 2009 made sure that the Montreal "cartel of money pipelines" significantly reduces the inflatability of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of searches and accused of fraud and corruption by a number of public officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillacourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused sensations when the Commission explained the "system" of procurement.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to a mob broker who then transferred the money to the Union Montreal side, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Since 2000, Zambia has been generous to all parties and has devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organised an illegal search for funds for former liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines whose prices were overset
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very Chilean.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and pocketbooks worth $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money providers that he had set the price.
Other public actors in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-working.
Martin Dumont, the organizer of the mayor's party, then accused Tremblay of unconcernedly closing his eyes to a parallel budget that brought dirty money into his treasury.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay resigned in early November, thus dropping Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivičre-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, it has been anti-sales land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a thriving real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "he's pulling strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the wet ant system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
The process, according to her, is "sick but positive".
We are in the phase of wound cleaning, but it is necessary to establish our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be returned.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have estranged hundreds of millions of dollars", but in particular he fears the role of "messengers informed of this scheme" unless they get wet in these shells!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of the Québek electoral campaigns comes from dirty money, and ironically he adds, "I heard it's just a faint diversion to reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to the parties to $100, but it does not think the situation will resolve: "Until the election spending is severely limited, dirty political money will disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the procurement and financing system of the parties: "We cannot go any further; if we focus courageously on the essence of things, we can build again on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story portrayed the image of Quebek and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all who mock him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG isn't FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went together, or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day, I move on with them.
The tech team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier when there's a game.
Everything's going so fast in football.
But I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontine until after my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved by degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
Support from this summer is used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out a player like me has a greater taste in the game and wants to give maximum power.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's got a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my efficiency.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have easily entered the eight-finals.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a difficult opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first so that we can play in the eight-finals back at home.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
The budget's already got...
In order for Paris to become a great European club, it must win titles and join history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had a chance to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually it's true that with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's going to work this year.
Even though large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to get a title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media is expecting too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something in the paper that we're not comfortable with.
One asks what more people can ask of you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to adjust our game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Liza's masters, we've proven we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn't made it to the eight-finals in the second season, and they've invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you could expect to have a head start in front of the other 15 points!
That insults the other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille Clubs, which did not have much success last season, moved with the new PSG to the next phase.
That shows how awesome the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It looks like the PSG is relying on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovich is very efficient and he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's the star of the 1st League.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
On our team we respect man and player.
And he respects the people around him.
What he's accomplished is truly exceptional.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French representation?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
I'm also doing a good game in the team today.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the team.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance appropriate.
How do you look at Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team for the first month?
He's talking results for him.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I did not experience such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negative current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
As is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euro...), so a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it is moving on the border about $10 (the exchange rate is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, it is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance, which took place in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money", "the competitive dollar and the euro" and "the period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the procedure in the video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and sometimes even trade back).
The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are depository books of current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between the two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction shall be electronically signed by the dual key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in a public book of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in recording this new transaction in this book.
It is carried out by means of the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is a file cutting phase; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, and then they'll cut the whole thing off.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (equivalent to zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other knots will easily check its correctness.
Transactions will then be irreparably displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user would like to pay twice the same money very quickly behind him (up to ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of both transactions - the other will be abandoned because each one has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is shared regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred million, so the margin space here is...
The difficulty of the task is also increased by the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and there has been an alienation of stored bitcoins.
"The used hole does not affect the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paimum, a company for payments of real money used by Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of laundering dirty money through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of Bitcoins do not.
In November, "groovy discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars has been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to turn bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or an uncontactable mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder shall manage his identity and thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up with traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized by phone", says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB envisages in its report a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Suroba).
NATO and US troops should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside whom we had punished because we considered them to be terrorists.
And so did we, because we lost 88 killed soldiers, and all those injuries and injuries.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often rurals who refuse the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks joined them.
They now experience tolerance and often help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted by the Mandlons thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly fashion.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attack with an aerial escort.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered to be their type of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, who have been completely controlled by Al-Ka'id, but their situation has not improved until now.
The former mujahedins, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, empowered state land, which they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They have been discredited; most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people long for a government they won't make thieves.
A number of young people want to leave just like those who have managed to exploit American generosity: capital flight is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they came to know the modern world and were intrigued by its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; currently 5 million people live in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already here.
Will the authorities that will be placed at her head be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should be looking forward to some degree of decentralisation following the example of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so there was a suspension of the post of prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially when the elections are scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is functioning, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
It's a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, it would be necessary for government control of infrastructure.
Word has spread that Afghanistan has huge, growing wealth.
And it just brought back the feeling that the Western states were here just to empower them.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore ore or copper on the spot and without means for transporting raw materials through the mountains, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the mine on Mes Ayanak copper and have allowed international archeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of the imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls and boys' lycea, French universities, French institutions, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "get a heart and soul" initiative has been in place to try to reconcile aid and military activities, in which the ministry of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, has achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages, thanks to the countless French NGOs.
These work, involving a large number of local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestation, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of the working area.
What kind of memory do we leave behind after two billion euros in military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order to free these farmers from the insurgency led by foreign groups, they wish, in their own words, to achieve minor civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard Work at the Egyptian Institute
President Muhammad Murcie has joined another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the declaration of a constitution that temporarily confers unlimited powers on it, it decided to play the bank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal speculation.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's disunity.
From the opposition's point of view, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues "contravening his word" and "slapping the law".
However, his followers ensure that it is a means of turning as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of explaining the article to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects the protests.
As confirmed in the interview for American weekly Time, Muhammad Murcie seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this quickly organised vote is being put before the ultimatum by the Egyptian people: "You will either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers" which should otherwise end after the new constitution has been approved.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the aforementioned constitutional assembly with the vast majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was announced, they knocked on the door with no way to push their opinions.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities have imitated their steps.
11 replacements were quickly added yesterday morning to achieve their capacity.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution have often been unanimously voted out.
The commentators continued to argue that one of the many disputes that day revolved around... prayer hours when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, finally remains in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that "the principles of the law of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Criminalism", objected liberals who saw only a verbal problem.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular for matters relating to the verification of conformity of laws with the law of Sharia.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, it is disturbing because "the people called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy in this."
The concerns of liberals are even more stirred by the fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the existing one.
"There has been no concrete religious consequence so far.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not broke, but university workers, many of whom studied in French schools," mild concern Alexis Blueet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
It agrees, however, that "there may be differences as to the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, pz. row.].
And in the future, the question of the extent to which civilian judges are competent to express themselves may arise."
Yesterday's approved text, apart from its religious pages, is highly criticized because of the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that there have been significant restrictions against the former regime.
Another disputed place: powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army representatives, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, there will be no prohibition of dealing with civilians in military courts, as requested by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
This association speaks of its doubts in relation to the text they believe is directed against freedom.
The criminal act of blasphemy is maintained and the offence is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef of the organization Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
That word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to appear in a television show last night, the event is scheduled for this afternoon.
The state's head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
Holy places, buds of the world and sea from the saturated salt solution await Ukrainian tourists in Israel
The earth that is promised in itself combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the inviolability of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow down to holy places
To visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God's mercy will descend upon all who enter this "bath".
And Galilee, instead of Jesus' miracles, turned water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most sacred places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the road of pain, or Jesus Christ’s way (Latin Via Dolores).
It begins at the fortress Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was held, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly button of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was grown, from which they made the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Grief, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave notes of wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Take the path along the vertical
The destruction of the fortress of Masada remained a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at a altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in mountain climbing can gain it by their own means.
The others will take the rope to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, there is a famous Hermon ski resort in the altitude of 1600-2040 m, which enjoys a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists are transported from the foot of the hill by a shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods supposedly lived at the top of the mountain.
Visiting a Unique Museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit everyone on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In its exhibition are widely represented by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with manikins of spa users and spa care providers from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private museum of Rally, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the lands in which they perished.
Ukraine is also listed.
Improve Your Health
Israel’s three main spa centers lie on the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can also bathe in winter months because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C.] and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C.].
The dead sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year long.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest mainland point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution that can easily maintain on the surface and people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Set out here to succumb to treatment with salt water - saltwater, and medicinal mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the air, diabetes to treat your palate.
Touch the Mysterious Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was the famous maritime route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The memories of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
In fact, tourists love to walk along narrow streets named after the signs of the beast.
It is said that if you press the walls in the street of "your" sign, happiness will be favorably favored.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other lands to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "get" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate of Pontus.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
It is better to take money with you, not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now there is 1 dollar about 3.8 shekel).
Buses are especially the city's transport, but there is a tram in Jerusalem and the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper city.
It's basically a subway.
Traveling all types of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with a change of 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening till sunset on Saturday, he stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you can only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without sheds and meals containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes made of lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, balllets made of minced cinnamon - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
Therefore, there are very many fat cats who gracefully "walk according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Previous cats love popular places, and with the taste they go into every kind.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And to borrow a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums average 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country and to rest.
The promised country visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Big and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While members and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling 'false' certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force under which every migrant working will be required to pass a test of Russian language knowledge.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the sectors of services, housing and utilities, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Language knowledge will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to people who successfully succeeded in obtaining an examination and an academic degree until the fall of the USSR in 1991.
Enjoyance, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: What does that really mean?
What will change the obligation to know the Russian language and visitors themselves?
So above all - the representatives of the migration service respond - will allow this to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slavery work."
Many people are talking today about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explained FMS Prime Minister Viktor Sebelev in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should start before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in non-professional immigrants, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - says with Sebelev's conviction - the future migrant is condemned to confront dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "show" to the horrible, cramped hostels in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will spend months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their country, but when they arrive they will cheat them, entertain their passports, pay their promised wages," the head of the Head of the Tajik Labour Administration, MS Tolib Sharipov, confirmed.
Don't bother!
Moreover, many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it's not their fault as much as their misfortune: only very few Turkmenistani, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least adequate basic education.
Their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need proper clothes, shoes, and equipment for school.
As children grow up to be productive age, they must go to work at the earliest opportunity.
Without the knowledge of language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and worthless."
It is true that, in view of the language test law, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
The testing will only take place in those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even pass the tests, or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers live illegally in Russia as before.
"Welcome, or the Unauthorized is forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all these language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and that's what blackmail is all about.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists about his experience with the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuskadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that false documents of migrants for registration were not only false.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of language examination.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hope of making it easier to complete the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That's two and a half times the amount of the official test: it's going to cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to ensure that the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy evidence, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time the time needed to complete the basics course of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where there is no need for active human interaction.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not launch an illegal arms market
The share of criminal offences using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia submits a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the case of shootings at weddings without victims was raised, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can get a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the committee of pride for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaj, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "crushing screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "insane tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasilj Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in conversation with the Russian BBC editor.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 offences were committed in six months 2012 using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the legislation in the field of civil weapons will not force the perpetrators to move to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can now be found at a low price in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Barañec, who worked for ten years at the offices of the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept weapons orders
The first one, "armed or military path", means a weapon that was stolen during the Caucasus fights.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasus themselves," said Barañec.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
The Ombudsman explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from officials of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires were founded intentionally - to cover the mannequin," said the former soldier.
They also contribute according to the words of Barance and the gun manufacturers.
"There are now private armoury companies that are not competitive on the international market and are dumping weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly large numbers of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small production, and there is a mafia that organised their smooth production," the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supply to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was processed in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists have collected reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "with the fault of the official agents whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from armed conflicts came from 14% of the cases where weapons were stolen in their production, 5% being "black archaeology".
A arms dealer who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeology" have long been purchased - are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers drive for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
Through the Ensign, the bidder will buy a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros for a piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is, the police are good at painting, and so whenever they start to burn a plan in clarifying crimes, they will conduct a check-up with traffickers with illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The sellers most often find themselves with the buyer through their acquaintances.
I've been visiting websites and blogs until a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the test platform, where there's going to be a man who would lead me to the corner, where we'll act together.
The prize I learned was there.
Military Rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
If I'm going to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman, the advisor. - I have a friend, but I don't trust him.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to settle the daughter's tooth loss."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He's also going to give it to me because he knows I'm not going to marry him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid - 1990s when he was working on a publication on the subject.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photos of "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier remembers.
The buyer, according to Baraněce, is not offered rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
Me, a potential client, I'm just not buying - we're going with a salesman to the woods and we're going to build a target.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and if I make sure the gun shoots well, we start acting," the expert describes the procedure.
Bin on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to the web site and groups on "Vkontakte", where you can buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"All you have to do is have a certain amount of money," they say in an ad on the website "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Ivan" (the inscription is retained).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently blew up a huge network of posted websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can scrape a shovel.
People rush like hungry fish into bait and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military officer Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: web pages are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make a payment via an ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photograph and a description of the instructions on where the gun is hidden," says journalist of the NGO "The Right to Gun" Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that when you place an order on the website you can lose your weapons and find yourself behind bars.

"People drag themselves like hungry fish on bait and then they get coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When you buy illegal firearms, you will normally pay an estimated amount of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Gun" you'll get a Makarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of such crimes in Russia declined by a total of 7% compared to the January-October 2011 period, accounting for 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of stolen and extorted weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the United States
Work on a cash register at McDonald's will take up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave is going to turn into a ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
All this action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries received by regular workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, the aim of the organisers of the protests is to achieve their creation in their trade organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday" when the cheap sales orgy hit America, took millions of people, and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, who worldwide work on 2.2 million people, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational companies of business chains whose goods are intended for people of lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores buy only at work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because they pay their employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the costs of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 per month.
Typical Walmart gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't correspond to the level of expenditure, the employees say.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is on average 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully on the consumer's shoulders, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's attorneys point out that the protest was only held in nine countries and society should not have caused practically any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
In total, her cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
The representative of Dan Fogelman said in an interview for Huffington Post's left-wing website that jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all about "further media sensation" organised by trade unions.
"Unoccupied treasury!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's commercial houses (they are not very popular in this advanced city, and therefore they are almost not there), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
He is currently making minimum wages for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York $7.25 an hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wages, but only slightly, and on average they receive their regular workers in New York $8.90 an hour.
There's no less pay in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work at a part-time desk and live with their parents will be employed by McDonald.
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I meet constantly in conversation with the "McDonald" workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses start receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of rapid refreshment.
American laws prohibit the administration from defending the establishment of trade unions and punishing union activists by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult to introduce a union organisation in a fast food business for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
I don't think so.
On this day there were also loud protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of this event was at the "McDonald" meeting in the vicinity of Times Square, where several local democratic politicians came forward, in particular a member of the town council of Jumaane Williams, who said "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters also welcomed the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayoral candidate Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must together stand up to support the workers of fastfood in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times reported, it was the greatest event of its kind in the history of the American sphere of rapid refreshment.
But only a few hundred people participated, although not all of them were quick - food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
If this event becomes a spark that ignites the flames of the mass movement, it is unclear yet.
"So far, the brain has been able to lie on average."
Among the fans of modern technology virtual reality is the popular theme of extended reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the fries of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also submitted a patent application.
The interview with the leader of an interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Isadim shows that the scientists of this company have seen the past.
It is a prospect of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us what your research team is up to?
- We deal with the interaction of a person with machines, but at the same time we are trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, most of all touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because it is a very interesting possibility for all to manage using gestures.
- What else are we going to do in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output stream has not been particularly so far.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but it's not appreciated?
- There is certainly no way to view him as anything - there is a question of privacy, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not gestures, just those big, short ones.
The gesture would not be filmed by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to bracelet size.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How will you ask me, for example, to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can better detect human reactions.
These may, for example, be laser sensors that provide relatively good deep resolution, which is very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution today, depth or something?
- In fact, the present generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like the matrix and the depth.
In the current perspective, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So very important is the speed, the number of images per second.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and the current data stream 30 images per second are frankly a little bit less, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, while the current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 mss).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
The equivalent of such a device would be very useful for me at work, but I just don't need that much touch, but I need some extra footage in a second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a receiver of a reflected signal.
And the third camera -- it's actually a common sensor of the visible band.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the amount of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system Kinect, play with camera location distortions and see how it helps to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think that with regard to the everyday use of technology-enlarged reality using special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "transferable" form of expansion of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones, projection screens and so on.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touchy response!
My hands can't feel a thing!
What are the answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that extended reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of the tangible impressions could easily be the eighth breakthrough.
For the time being, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the other hand as a certain kind of background for displaying.
It's an excellent way to record compressions!
But there are also technologies that really focus on adding tangibleity to these "eyes in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic rays at the defined point where the finger is located creates a tangible feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve ending in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
So he thinks he's feeling what he seems to be feeling at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking in an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running lines (not like in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain lying becomes a goal, it is a job for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the complete beginnings.
Tasty instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrohrad avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list have already been significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose profits exceed the city's framework, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the all-out vote.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at fashion pubs and at the vernisages.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they're exhibited, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical Petrohrad narrators, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a prominent man of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets makes a smile on the face of the citizens, heightens everyone’s mood.
Recently he took the bottle into his hand and became a petrohrad bottlemaker because he matured into this complex role with his whole Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red as a designer in terms of image and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and the public.
Although in general it is true that anything that differs slightly from gray is an act of aggression and arousing bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That's when the wave of free old unofficial artists crossed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonev who led us to "Puskinské 10", and the other waves were not.
It lures me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except words.
- And it all happened at your art clinic... - It was important for me to find myself at the centre of the culture of Pettierburg where all the best creative powers should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a place on Pushkinské 10, and there was a music-art club, a Bohemian club, a home of the Petersburg bohemian.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought the cord with the project "Early Van Gogh".
The cord and his friends sang under a rink of light songs, dressed in adjacent trimmings, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-Gallivic times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboidov - that's the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and permanent guests went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000 the survey was organized in the press, the special price was "People in Our City".
In the nominee "The Artist of the Year", I was appointed, thus ending my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits that capture current and insight.
I'm going to have a program exhibition called the Russian Museum of Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, being that way today is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is wiped clean, the tragedy is taken away.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by totalitarian disguise in order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, they focus on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him your hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We've seen you as a city bottlemaker recently. - A culture town should have a hero like that.
And who would it be if it wasn't me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's been a breakdown of cultures.
People used to meet in noises, for God's sake, she loved one simple other people.
Today everything has broken into microcommunity, today it's very difficult to like everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to be liked by everyone.
Today you have to think about who you're going to like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand viewers will come to the Mikhailov Stas!
- He's gonna be approached by fans, sexually involved.
And there's 300 people coming to the cultural land, and 10,000 won't come, and the result is less management, less money, less everything.
I've got fans, and the main thing is, no one's gonna cheat on them, and they're not gonna break what's been experienced.
When I was young, I used to paint pictures of a collector hanging on a wall with Falk and Lario.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often get confused.
They say:Cultural culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's different.
I'm a man of culture last day, I grew up on examples of artists living in poverty and dying in poverty, refusing money for painting paintings.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
Cyril, what's the drawback in Pettenburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is this notion: an employee through culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper emperors it was not so in everything, the emperors may not have understood culture too much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they're stuck in a corner somewhere, because there's a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Today's taste buds.
The same is true of Erart, but it is different from saying that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petterburg is?
- Petrburk - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
And on our eel, art is going bad.
We need cultural soil, but today we have writers more than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
There's only a weak layer like that in our house.
We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented under the St. Petersburg grant
To give birth in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with grounders on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: How can you keep your family in a state of trouble or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says a highly built scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Schternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better living conditions on Mars, they reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500 ° C] on the surface of Venus.
It's only possible to live there in great heights or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists started to solve reproduction issues in space with flora.
About half a century ago, experiments were made on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbits are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then an insect was taken out into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979 a crimp egg was sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a state of weightlessness.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the way out.
But then trouble starts.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find resistance, stand on its own feet and start moving," says Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) head RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find resistance, the birds are chaotically falling and making cotmels.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds had a complete extinction of instincts.
Birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, within four days, they just died.
"We had the birds hatched twice, but then we rejected it because it is simply impossible to work with them," said the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew on the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been broadcast into space.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts should be carried out," Vladimir Sychev said.
After landing on the ground, a progeny was born with space rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to get close to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when losing their normal environment.
Man, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens rule by abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Těreškov's greatest danger.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tea's gone, and no one on Earth could tell if they could make it to space.
Is she able to have a baby after a flight like this?
"But no one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the missile-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after a flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Těreškovová's daughter gave birth.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988 the son of the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savička was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We only have a few cosmonauts who have been born after many years and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts learn the skills needed to work in an open universe.
Water mimics the state of gravity.
Although water is a comfortable yet strange environment for adults, it is a natural life for young children.
It seems that small ichtians confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother’s fertile water and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only two weeks will pass.
"It is very little for a child to forget something," says New Baby Swimming instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short - if the condition of the newborn child is more natural, then for women it is more natural to have inevitable gravity, attractive strength.
In a state of weightlessness occurs very quickly to reduce abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, the ability of the body to eject the foetus.
This can be left aside if muscle stimulants work during delivery.
After all, it is possible for the baby to take place in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism will expel the fetus.
"What next?" asked Valerij Poljakov in complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by earthly attraction, it cannot properly form a bone or a system of muscles.
A newborn on an orbital track cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a burden in which he can train.
He will simply be spared what he needs unconditionally for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring on Earth a disabled person who will be totally unsuited to the local environment," says the chairman of the Bioethics Commission RAN Igor Pestov.
So giving birth to children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, there will be a time when the earthlings will be released into their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the NKKU: Control of the schwartz system failed to blame politicians
Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in relation to public contracts, but in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálna.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us," comments the current situation of Kala.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter's approach to the so-called "schwartz system" is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother an entrepreneur with his controls - is he prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits anything, it cannot prevent the Prime Minister from acting in an office which is obliged to control and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the House of Representatives, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties comparing legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was it specifically about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, is followed by individual national legislation and then also by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the control has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation may be "more strict and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote itself to the application of law.
What can this project really do for you, what does it do for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop trying to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits if it does not have such a positive effect.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price in order to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit of contracts, we do not necessarily need to achieve that.
Maybe the system will be absorbed by such a amount of paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with translating legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NKKU here, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way as us, also has a college, only forms in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities do the same.
The powers are also somewhat similar, of course, because Germany has a social arrangement, so these Courts of Auditors also have at the level of the federal countries - in this way the system differs slightly from ours.
The BRH can only control the federal money, represented by state funds.
The public funds managed by the provinces and the municipalities are controlled there from the level of the municipal accounting courts.
As far as legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better in everything.
Is it also necessary that they have better controllers?
I'm sure you don't, but again, I don't like that comparison.
But it has to be said that even countries that we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit in working with our office, would there?
With regard to domestic legislation, which meant amendments to the Public Procurement Act to your office, are its effects already manifest?
Since the duration of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet evident in our control actions.
Since we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
So far, we are only seeing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new instrument of "detection of the risks of insolvency", through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there will naturally be changes in the limits, conditions of certain types of procurement will be adjusted and so on.
So you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit, or another burden of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that it will be hard on itself and not be able to keep them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, persons under control are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does the law thus strengthen?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who have formal doubts that have no effect on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother an entrepreneur with the controls of the so-called "schwartz system" - and what does that mean?
Is the Schwarz system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits anything, neither can the Prime Minister prevent an office which is obliged to control and enforce its duties.
He can say, "Let's change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're gonna do anything like that.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are relatively strict rules as to what is to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing from us.
The roads are frozen, mostly but slippery.
In several places of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, though, the carriages are slippery, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were rolling this morning, but places were frozen and snowy as well.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it is expected to warm slightly.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Circle Mountains.
The places were also less visible due to fog, resulting from data on the dispatch of regional road users.
The R6 and first-class communications in the region are now free of restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some crossings where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also rolling.
But in some sections there are still leftovers of frozen snow and places of frozen snow.
Above all, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubický and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic there is a threat of frost, in higher positions and on the mountains there may be a strange layer of snow on the communications, reports on its pages of the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
Road drivers warn drivers against freezing, it can be especially in higher positions in the Pardubic region.
It can be found in the vicinity of Lanskroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Policek, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav.
The snow is especially on roads in Krkonoše and Orlické Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to half clear without collisions.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a weak wind.
Plzeň region
Roads in the Plzeň region are rolling this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures moving between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The seats must also count with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This comes out of the information of the district roadmasters.
D5 is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by communication controllers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
But there may be frozen sections in southern Plzeňska and Tahovska.
Communication from the second and third classes is wet and also in this case notices of frozen sections apply.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the Forest.
Olomouc Region
With snowcrays on the road today, drivers must count to the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical spill, she remained on the Red Sea saddle and on her way to the Villian Cross.
Roadmen rushed into the field at night, snowing about three centimeters [three cm] to Šumpersk, according to road managers.
In other parts of the region, tickets are usually free of restrictions.
"In Šumpersk lies the remains of snow in the highest positions.
With snowballs on the Red Sea saddle, drivers have to count towards Jesenik," the ČTK driver of the highway traffic management said today.
In the field at night their colleagues also went to Jesenick, the roads to and from the highest positions are now according to them after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In Olomouck, roads are free of restrictions, but in Sternbersk drivers should be careful in the forest sections where wet carriages remain.
Ustecký kraj, Liberecký kraj
A few difficult places are reported this morning by a roader in the north of the Czech Republic.
In addition to several places with snow or ice attacked, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice on Ústeck is closed, resulting from a police database.
Temperatures are kept below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Mediterranean, on the other hand, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported mainly by road passengers from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, it was the ideal conditions for her at night - during the day of rain and concealing snow, at night clear and cold.
Unfavourable conditions are also reported from the main moves on the I/13 road at the border of Ustec and Liberec Region.
The closing from Telnice to Knínice forced the bent branches of the trees, which bent to the carriage under the snow.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to collect positive energy
How do you feel about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap Tap, we make fun of it, and we say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to push the end of the world away or prevent it.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national benefit we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20th from 21:00, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was probably my idea, and then we came up with everything with our artist Honzo Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world will be passed on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
Is she very popular on YouTube today, too, at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in complete conclusion, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It's sung by all the interpreters at all three concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be connected in a unique direct transmission to the Czech TV.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video is played by Tomáš Hanák, also by Xindl X...
How did you get along with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertained.
What will be the profit from concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the Barrier-Free Educational Centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Tap Civil Association in the Jedličk Institute.
Students of the Jedličk school are regularly attended by lecturers and are engaged in activities that entertain and interest them.
Students themselves do not have the means to turn themselves in as lecturers, so we are trying to enable them to do so.
As part of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several music groups and interpreters will perform at each concert.
What did you choose them by?
We've been trying to put together a program that will address all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrate with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombast action" for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time in Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and personally, while we are in the US, I would like to connect with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of disabled people.
How do you manage these roads logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, her carts must travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry along a large amount of cargo and a toolbox...
However, so far it has always been without problems, both ČSA and British Airways have been excellently prepared to see how many times I have been amazed.
Even in Moscow, from which we had recently returned, that was no problem.
Visits abroad can compare how individuals differ in barrier-freeness, public access to disabled and the like.
What have you two been up to?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in full effect in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, where it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move himself in the center of the city.
There's no such thing as a way to give the carts priority in the elevator.
Fortunately, civil society is already in the process of trying to alert people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, do we still have to catch up with a more mature country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with severe handicaps move independently in public, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not uncommon for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, on the contrary, with The Tap Tap a little bit ahead!
Respect for the public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things start to change for real.
So far, these are unique cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years, which made you start it in 1998?
I took up as a tutor at the Jedličk Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something to do.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing a saxophone, so I started an interesting music ring with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our moderator, Ladja Angelovich, says, it got a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity hasn't come in years or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to connect with well-known singers and also to work actively to promote the band.
We realized that a job that can't be seen is essentially not there.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to reach out to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to be able to do something different.
Showbusiness is full of things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is regret, that's natural...
But that regret is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for the whole society.
Did it also help this success that you're a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be in many ways uncompromising and require some discipline.
I mean, that's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on concert trips, they will quickly abandon them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
At present, the Tap Tap band has 20 members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only the only ship Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, we can't stop it.
Who has the will and the taste always has the door open in us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00 p.m.
It will take place in Prague incheba arena, Brno Fledě and Ostrava Plynoj with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be joined by telemost at the concert of the band The Tap Tap Tap "The End of the World Canceled"
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multi-functional barrier-free education centre STUDeo at the Jedličk Institute in Prague in the volume of CZK 25 million
The entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 have free admission tickets in the pre-sale Bohemiaticket
Polish and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency as the second country in the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the next years.
However, Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
For years, Polish enthusiasts were devoted to space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 represented the ideas of his pioneering work The entrance to cosmonautics.
The thoughts of a young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after the years of Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won Robert Esnault-Pelteri and André Louis Hirscha's prize for entering cosmonautics in France.
The remembered Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a railway uniform was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to disperse the sink or to stop it.
The information on this cloth is only known from the time stamp.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to revolve around missiles.
The study was provided by the Chamber of Technology of Armed Forces in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Professor Gustav Mokrzyckiegim.
It is clear from the materials preserved that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But the arrival of the German troops was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric rocket racer designed by the engineer Rogozinski appeared in a professional press and in the following year the work of Rocket - torpedo aircraft and rocket launcher of the aircraft author Lelyví-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee) was involved in all projects of military use of missile technology.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activity ended the start of the war.
Other works dedicated to cosmonautice appear after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Society of Astronautics).
For the first time, there is a reference to society in the November 1954 issue of Problem magazine, where four major articles are devoted to astronomy.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already under way, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautic Federation (founded 1951) and has become a regular member of the PTA in autumn.
And the following year, the first President of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function lasted until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The 1,800-metre-long rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the Bledov Desert flight test of a two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development type was already supposed to be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962 another development was suspended.
The first RM rockets were followed by the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differed in the size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, there was a development of the Meteor-2 rocket at the Air Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a useful load of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
The following versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslavlaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively discussion in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalised economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, nothing to limit the movement of private capital, along with harmless financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in labour prices (wage) there is a price voltage.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer seeks to remain competitive in importing cheap goods by "substantiating" the price of the competitor in order to bring about a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad or to shop there cheaply or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its unemployment, the social expenditure of the State is rising.
The whole situation is reinforced by the total reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social social damage he has done in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistical data are required.
The ruthless practices of private capital create in individual economies a situation where individual governments are forced to enter into competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments give private capital to the population regardless of social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in changes in applicable laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to adopt a price dictatorship of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.
This is also the case with the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, but also with the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In SRNA, there have been many years of public food outlets for the poor who cannot eat their own work.
The number of these people goes back to millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for the well-employed to receive such wages that they must be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary members of the Federal Parliament.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation when people are forced to either emigrate as they were in the 19th century or to live behind the hungry wages at the edge of society in the hope that private investment will eventually come to the country.
But where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, or Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt, or Africans are still working for a fraction of European wages.
That's what Latin America is all about.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot capitalise on its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital of the mother-in-law insists that the State must not intervene in the economy.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, in fact, it now governs politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
The evidence is that there is virtually all-powerful and all-state lobbying.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
In SRNA, the situation is that state ministries are tasking the drafting of laws to private law firms which are closely related to industry.
These draft laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as Western-type institutions do, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into the situation as described by Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in complete decomposition and authorities have become violent.
For bribes, unlawful gain of favor and with the use of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ... "The characteristic people did not resort to the office at all, so one day as a result of this defiance was eight months without consuls" ... "It really began to talk about the fact that the only cure in a bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Appianos thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed the permanent democracy into self-government.
The conclusion As in ancient times, the current society is based on an inconsiderate preference of its own benefit, regardless of the whole community's interest.
Private capital is no longer in its essence able to understand and apply the overall benefit.
The result is now, like then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform a deeper scale.
The causality of the arrival of Fascist and Communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalisation of the 19th and 20th centuries economic systems.
In the current state, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered a break with the expectation of another round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and internal European level, the Czech Republic government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
Sting in Fragile's song, whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have always been a lot of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel, argue its right to self-defence, and Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is in the recurrent waves of murder by the culprit and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view of the curtain, a view of who has been served primarily for 95 years of ongoing tension (based on Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the historical facts available, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
Human history is primarily the history of the power struggle.
In every era, we can track down some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether they were always those personalities who were completely autonomous in their steps or whether someone behind their throne was directing their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must accept that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and its resulting power could not occur in the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone else is above them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschild.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased in the 1990s to stop linking their name with the high criminal acts in which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth or both.
They have a major stake in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where central bank shares are not running or preparing wars (before Afghanistan attacked it was 7 countries, after Iraq was attacked it was 5 countries, after Gaddafi was overthrown only four, but in the meantime Russia submitted the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank of Rothschieldov Bank of America, began to issue his own (understand government) money during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began spending his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, was murdered in 1963, Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their longing for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by the highest, 33rd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove large monarchist states in Europe, the second was to remove colonial domination in particular from Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a prelude to such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families headed by Rothschieldy is working on is triggering the crisis and then offering a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED to avoid the recurrence of crises such as those caused in 1907).
So after they succeeded in killing Habsburg's successor, R-U, Ferdinand's throne in Sarajevo, to unleash the first world war, they destroyed Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, militarily and economically unfoundedly, Germany's surrender (no longer needed war to destroy Imperial Russia) and then the fragmentation of Central European power, Austria, took place.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers allowed the political process to create a latent conflict situation by placing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the assumption of radicalisation of the debilitating masses and then simply by subduing the Germans with a strong enough force, the culprits of the labelling and simple solution of the leader and by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also by playing, the function of the fifth column, at the start of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds set up the Zionist Movement, whose branch sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea and Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has already created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, the first conflicts with the local Arab population have begun.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out if Hitler broke out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or if everything he did in his plan was difficult to estimate, then the suffering of European Jews in concentration created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany’s war reparations were earned in World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the outbreak of war III.
If international bankers manage to deploy it, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the first-line victims, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let's just take a sharp look at how people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power was at the beginning of all things?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to choose in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is Netanyahu, a typical example of Fascism, of international loyal bankers, a policy that does everything to unleash war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to turn into a global conflict and, in view of Iran's control over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all world oil (a swimming corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is now the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their vision is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a completely controlled being.
"And he forces all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell who is not named after the beast or the numeral of its name.
You have to understand that: who has the sense to count the numbers of the beast.
This number denotes a person and it's number sixty-six."
Film Argo: When the worst is, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown chess of Mohamed Réz Páhlaví, who after the revolution fled to the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, there was no positive starting point - she could not afford to throw a move across the deck, as she would be a major threat to trust with allies in other countries.
The release of hostages, but in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the Theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after the negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their role at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America brought small victories.
Six employees escaped from it just before the embassy.
After complex peripetions, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, assisted by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff, which in the country looked at locations to shoot a sci-fi big film.
A combination of genres
The plan, which invented an expert on "exploration" by Tony Mendez, also required cooperation from Hollywood.
For the legend to be credible, a film project was written in specialized magazines, a press conference was organized, a fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically understood political thriller, at the same time called "caper motion", a story of a successful piece, a hint - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, moods change - on the one hand, documentaryly understood sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic time photographs of events and the way in which the same situation was presented in the film - there are no big differences in this.
On the other hand, lightened passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight excess.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - the men in the suits are discussing the situation at the desks, in the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a mocked actor he became a respected director, and his acting also ceased to be a target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck's shot that doesn't take place in the director's home Boston.
The quote for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also exhibits it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in reconstructing the real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its transparency, which simultaneously mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history is clearly moving.
Similar effects are achieved by Affleck and his associates in scenes of fiction (false headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story he told does not offer much in the film sense of tense scenes.
He's doing pretty well with it, sometimes he'll come up with something real - everything doesn't work out so elegantly there (the scene in which the threatening crisis at Tehran Airport will turn the phone in America and the rave after the rave seems quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the liquefaction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood associates, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing its dramatic move, it's a picture that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciate the realization and retro style of evolutionary thrillers in the 1970s.
But it's hard to break.
As a reminder of one way so far, living history and proof of how exaggerated the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but enough.
Rules for the inflating of balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnichargey.com server, which publishes an annual survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led by the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the right organiser of the Patrick Nacher survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women is already among the nominal absurdities.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance prices, as insurance companies are objectively less at risk.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
A controversial EU regulation should include the mandatory incorporation of bio-substances into fuel materials, which is detrimental to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or the Directive on the size of hens, for which it has significantly betrayed eggs this year.
The criticism previously faced a de facto ban on the use of the expression anointing butter or the elimination of classic lamps from the sale.
Qualitative bananas are to be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a State or a group of states (so now the Czech Republic also enforces the requirements of its banks by the threat of veto).
The interests of the lobby also stood because, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach at least 14 cm in length and should not show an "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has, however, defended itself by harmonising the existing uneven national standards that have complicated trade.
EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened, through the opposition of some countries, with the indication that existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in a survey may also be the EU regulation last year, under which the sale of inflatable balloons must be obliged to point out that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred here to American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children for strangulation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under the age of 14 when they blow up in crevices.
Curious ideas are also born at home
A relatively absurd rule for European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire has nominated for the survey, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food stocks that could be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, certain volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The survey organisers were also intrigued by the idea of paying some countries for having no sea and the idea of granting grants on a grant application.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are beset by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palace (ČSSD) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain had been born in our country, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, it was to become full of warehouses that he had to export.
The EU, according to the Palace, was to pay hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic's further to ports.
Finally, the European Commission came across the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant was offered by the Ministry of Local Development, managed by Minister Pavl Němec (US-DEU), specifically to write down a request for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While the regulation is easily critical in the Member States, EU regulatory efforts and more effective functioning and development of the whole Union are more likely to be recognised by a number of experts.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have forced themselves to do in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion between the Czech Republic also stirs up the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic in Brussels must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and not always succeeds in this match.
Although Czechs maintained the marking of the Olomouc formations after six years of fighting the Germans and the Rakas, the local rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed native by our manufacturers.
Rum designations can only carry products of cane distillate, not sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-renowned cheeses of feta and gorgonzol, marzipan from German Lübeck or parmish ham have already been found, for example, carlovar, mountain and trebonian carp and chorech hops.
The EU’s trademark can then also be proud of the Pardubic feather and the mountain pipe.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it works in our country without problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't watch the country steal for the last 20 years, the thieves running around, the people getting taxed and the age of retirement.
I didn't have the ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you're on your way to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All this time I said that I would go to battle for the Castle according to the outcome in the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a function, my function is an instrument of how I can carry out my visions.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is not only that we as a nation are broadcasting at the pub and at television, but that we are going to slap anyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, the media, who degonize and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie, are added.
I've been told that I'm paying the press or that I've been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have embarked on the battle for the Castle with these substantive and criminal responsibilities of politicians and property returns of over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to handle this?
As a citizen, when I lobbied for leadership to be a free trade, it worked.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or on the right, they will reject it on purpose, and it will delay the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential of obtaining support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party chatter and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are turning me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against bad thinking.
You're freaking out when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business venture in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Someone might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they've been talked about by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only be left with passwords.
And that's not enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce criminal and material responsibility for example?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on their side to push it.
If I am elected president, there is no problem in organising a direct television broadcast, where I will ask the Presidents of Parliament's parties to legislate substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and the public prosecutor.
And if they did, they'd have to tell us why they didn't want her.
If there is a strong personality that will name the dangers, it can be pushed to the political scene.
Take the president's direct election, it was public pressure.
On the level, I say I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
In politics, I've just started and I'm going to try to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and back in the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been around a lot of famous people whether or not they'd run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, the one who refused for a lot of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who was covering scams with light-fueled oils.
I ran with people really unhappy, but now I'm on the ropes.
Sixty percent of the people didn't go to the polls, and those who went to the polls mostly chose a representative of the establishment.
We're only two independents in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate so that change will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as for the direct choice of mayors or heaths.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential party, and I don't have the money for it.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign. My transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have any money?
Are you talking about the property confessions that are yours?
I estimate private property for about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property of about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of art works for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, he was gallant to women and he was fighting bad and bad.
You drive Aston Martin, you have 60 million dollars worth of property, and you don't have money to campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put too much money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Do I owe you that?
I've hit the campaign for two and a half million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program is probably not so interested.
And I don't have a campaign to pay off my own.
The cost of the campaign is essentially going to cover what I'm going to get from the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, like I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I'm not running.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to stop these activities?
But that doesn't have to do with the pay.
As promised, I have partially suppressed my activities.
For example, the travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How old were you as a businessman to take a month?
Two hundred to four hundred, which I'm taking further.
And if I was president, I'd quit my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of Law.
The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not just in the head - for example Spikenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"This building seems cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally it is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT tech in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, this house is nice."
I ask, however, what else do we need the library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-fashioned libraries are voluntarily attended today, are they?
Spikenisse, a place close to Rotterdam without his own job opportunities, which are not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision fell to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive has not been in any distasteful way.
And so the city council found out that there is only one way to become a master of statistics: we have to have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of madly bold column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with normal tranquility and at the competition in 2003 appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still glancing around and shoving its shoulders, Maas was holding his gifts in his size and ended his activistly justified speech with the words "Dear Town Hall!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spikenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30m-euro mountain was completed.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and private houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was marked the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which has so far not been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, where you would rather expect a white facade, is richer for a bit of contemporary architecture.
First of all, Spikenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of his existence.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression: reading eldorado under the cheese lid.
Although the elevator rides through the mountain range, the real spatial and reading passions will be revealed only when you walk through topography.
From all sides, the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cabron and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books.
"Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly uncomfortably and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have built the classic spatial configuration upside down and the reader space has been pushed from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is skillfully used: there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and central domestic techniques in the center.
Special comfort is the black bookshelves on books, which are once-covered walls, one parapet, and the other side of the stairs.
The appearance, structure, and smell of each other seem strange.
Even the architects and construction engineers swear upon the unknown building material by twisting their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at Spikenisse Town Hall, on a request from Standard magazine.
So one day in a French farm, we ran into a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years it has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a basis for the roots of a millimeter fleece made of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time-effective.
A thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then is ripe to be thrown into a bulky waste.
For the library, the rouna - for the first time in such a quantity - was painted on boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
The effect of heat and pressure on the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) will color in dark, homogeneous and heavy material, which smells a little like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.
You'll get to the top of 105 stairs.
At the end of almost 500 metres of long travel, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and figurines in flower shops.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the mountain of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is despite many glass surfaces of a demonstration project on ecology," Trouborst said.
It warms and cools the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines in just a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden vases, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as a shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The air conditioning in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even referred to Boekenberg as "the long-awaited soul" Spikenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to open a book a few weeks ago to give away a book from his personal fund.
Thus, the optical gaps should first be filled in a not fully equipped library that currently has 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, now everyone has a relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This has been done by the MVRDV in royal discipline, which is called the creation of an identity in a professional sargon.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
Whatever's young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szaboa is balancing Berlin on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signalled that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to the establishment of an unmanned zone.
That's where NATO eventually planted it.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy now, in the direction of a policy that was so-called US-controlled, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just settling in on their role, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign policy.
To a foreign policy they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows willingness to take positions in the case of national interests and positions which are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of other powers, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large residence in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but not the elite in Arab countries.
Anyway, that's what plays the part.
But I wouldn't want to attribute too much importance to it, it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany's relations with the US deteriorate when Germany abstained from voting on Palestine in the event of both important decisions?
I think there is a great deal of understanding for the German attitude in Europe and even in the US.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a fracture as Libya.
Perhaps even Germany will earn some respect.
This signals that it must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the U.S. has made a clear statement for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always been due to American domestic policy.
I think Obama's government seems to have a very secret understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, stand out in public.
I think that differences of opinion are not at all as great as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very excited about Netanyahu politics at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
So they can't be part of a wider line, and instead they have to push things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes a bigger role, anti-German sentiments will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to various neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU is currently failing to fill this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America study together the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Shabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Mark Protection" in China: When Couma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a designation which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it uses protection for as long as they are not sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it's not clear if they're entitled.
"For foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office who specializes in violating the protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case will land on my desk.
Forgers already have a few extra letters to sign up for their brand.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way German companies are also legally copied, such as the manufacturer of the sports goods of Puma.
Pattloch is opening an orderly with stamp office records in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had there to protect the Zegna DF Puma brand. An artificial name that also parasiates on the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and violating intellectual property.
There are several storehouses in large cities where counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different. By entrusting his mandate, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies receive from the trade mark office the right to use the label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages business, we have to deny it," Pattloch calls.
"The mark is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to CLSA market research company, China is the largest luxury product type and fastest growing market with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, erasure of questionable records in the register of stamps can be difficult to achieve, and it costs something.
Driving can last up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed the lawsuits because the name in question became "market reality" after a long time.
When the defendant has bad luck, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the construction machinery Sana, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps for the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to that of the Mercedes.
Geely, who bought the Volvo, originally used a blue logo that resembled the BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of Lacoste fashion goods lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
While the CTMO's trademark admits that there were shortcomings there in 2010 due to too few employees and spaces.
But last year, "the progress of the work process has returned from an emergency to normal".
For example, the number of pending proceedings on objections dropped by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something against doing it is expensive
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
That's a record, and that means that China is running a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were selected for the fees.
This simply means that each login costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth several times to start the dispute, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans had achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts had been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter secured Chinese rights to Freudenberg's brand further.
We would have warned ourselves, because in Germany last name cannot be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO's brand office also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg gained rights, but the opponent is still fighting in the dispute.
You need to be very careful.
The case is now under consideration at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company's archives they even had to examine a hundred years old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered "a high six-digit amount in euros" in vain to settle the dispute.
"That's what you see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East threatens to affect Europe as well.
And that's in case the impersonators get unprotected stamps there.
In Germany, for example, one Chinese producer wanted to sign off on Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This business area has long since given up, yet it has been able to reverse registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advises German businesses to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Aliens would rather have "anything that is worth protecting, report in China as well," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he will probably have to pay the licence fees for his own name by contrast, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed from the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Kicking, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation - and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who died on AIDS are happy about it.
A story of a connection that transcends much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's moccasins are looking for the floorboard and they find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - rush, mom and each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it out of his textile shoes when he joins the voices with his woolly wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is testing a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher in human genetics to a native.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every congregation voice has a different text and in a very foreign language - a Zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help With Your Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that there are about 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of that 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died on AIDS.
HIV is already positive for over 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died on AIDS, the community of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany found in the village of Esitjen.
70 of them attend secondary school.
A patronage may be taken over in 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees a child a school uniform, a school uniform and a warm meal a day at Gogo Centre.
Imbongi means "story teller" in the Zulu language or also "the praiser".
Gas can't be spoken in this space by anyone but singing.
For almost ten years he has been practicing the choir of songs in this strange soft language and sometimes also brings them back to where they originally come from: South Africa.
At a distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, there is a village in Eshiteni, northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which depends on the mightiness of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay huts or straw huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitania, you can see in the small state of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The cut of the male foreskin, which proves to reduce the risk of the disease by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity within them, and it is not uncommon that they die in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school degree, they don't stand a chance in a poor country anymore.
At first, it was the private placement of individuals who, in a few euros a year, allowed the child to be sent to school and given one warm meal a day.
A year later, however, a congregation of Voices for Africa was formed, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died on AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Lightning and itching belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who are the most affected groups?
Syphilis and capillary occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha’s Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilid reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are common, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (pulmonary), capillary and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in us, but about 20 percent of newly infected people are HIV-infected.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavirs are common among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilid infections according to the Constitution of Robert Kocha increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected people has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urinating, swelling, abdominal pain and blisters or nipples.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore not be observed.
How can you protect yourself?
Disease hazards can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by contamination from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, particularly in the case of frequent alterations of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, most SPIs can be cured and no later effects can be prevented.
Thanks to the patronage, the gifts of charity, and, last but not least, the fees that the congregation will make by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Essiten," said the president of the association, Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany manages the village of Zodwa Domini, a self-confident woman who can enforce.
It also ensures that weaned children find shelter, such as in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu language is called to old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them married 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that their children arrived on time each day in school uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone go to a shelter in Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the community as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two hens and together with the American health organization PSI made sure that many people in the village were given HIV tests.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarchy of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This country's approved way of life is also responsible for the fact that HIV has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To at least support cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once in two, three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combat, confidence in the future and confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy but also tears to many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjen, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, the Ezulweni Valley is more than famous.
"Go to Eshiten, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an air line of 8733 kilometers from here, to the asshole singers in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, you can see the light shining here.
Messenger: NASA Discovered on Mercury Ice · Global Voices
The Messenger probe found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as follows from three studies published Thursday by an expert magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water came from comets or perhaps asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the lead scientists working on the Messinger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us explain how water and other basic elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, undetected earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images, a small window into endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun around Neptune, Ceres is not according to the new concept of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 "planet".
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the worse identifying ones are pink-coloured "new-diverse" in the birth hall of the stars.
This area where stars form - scientists call it unromanticly W5 - discovered Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia in the distance of 6,500 light-years.
This alternating glow of dying stars has captured NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The hollow ring consists of a material that the star wrinkled during the dying process.
In the giant Nebula Trifid, which is 5400 light years away from Earth, comes from the gas and dust of a new star.
A photograph of the galactic cradle was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Star of the Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", is seen at night with only an eye.
But with the telescope, they're better off coloring.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer on this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellations of the Aquarius.
Its similarity with the planetary planet has brought to this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photographs is the source of unusual coloring.
This baby among the stars was able to detect in full beauty as much as the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps it's the remains of Saturn's moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: a veritable galaxy
Pictures of the spiral galaxies become real works of art according to their coloration.
The footage published by the European Southern Observatory shows several thousand light-years away from the Trifid Nebula in the shooter's constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (split into three parts, triclonal), because the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar obstetrician into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosh, astronomers photographed a premonition of cosmic collisions: 400 million light years away from the Earth, they are married to the cores of two merging galaxies and must inevitably collide.
This birth of the star was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it the South Windmill.
The photograph from Hubble's space telescope shows the cut of the Iris nebula in Cefe's constellation.
This 1,400 light-years distant nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever-increasing new arrivals.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosette nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was not until shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was mostly found in the universe.
Our views on the universe: the most important telescopes
He reportedly invented it in 1608 before Galileo Galileo used it to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views they mediate are getting deeper.
The world's largest view was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope on the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In the American Arizona stands Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge.
Mirror Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Its diameter, however, reaches about 10 feet [11 m].
The disadvantage of cheap design: the telescope is provided with a high angle hook, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high intensity of the light current.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, will match the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Radio telescopes in Arecib (Portorico) search the universe for alien signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for alien intelligence - can help any computer owner that will make its computer performance available.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a Very Large Telescope here, and it honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 metres full and consists of almost 1000 mirrors.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two of Keck's telescopes in the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest until 2007.
They offer immediately two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also monitors the universe and the IRTTF telescope.
Also on Mauna Kea is to create a new giant telescope - with a 30-metre diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions of the universe give us Hubble's cosmic telescope.
It has been providing remote worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets have been identified since the start of the mission.
The image documents the latest preparations before launching the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webb's space telescope (JWST) will be launched into space first in 2018 on board the Ariane5.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Great Bang.
Scientists believe that ice is also on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet far closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown for several decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily and you will live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be Bible - trained.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be Bible - trained.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call driving up Talyš wildly romantic.
The microbus runs along the road with many corners along densely forested hills, rough rivers and simple rural conditions.
Everything's green and juicy, it almost looks like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this right here is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasus ethnic group of the Talys lives, which is not very well known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and live to a very high age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts too much monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours at 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The mythical wealth for which the country owes oil to the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the means to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Grand Eurovision Award in May - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulajev said.
She's the director of a museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Talysh from the surrounding area, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulajev shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the disputed star of this museum was the shepherd of the sheep who was allegedly 168 years old by Müslümov.
Of course, there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest person with the documents was 122 years old, the age of Müslüm seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajev.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children, said at the age of 136 he had yet to father a daughter.
So he wasn't wrong about Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at Max Planck's Institute in Rostock, heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Absolutely many people of high age live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when there are no matrices.
Each day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is, people in the area around Leric often experience Bible age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijan's Farid Mugimzadeh guide explains this to the Talysh special genes.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuleva Museum believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
However, the caloric diet of the Talysh who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, does not seem to be as healthy as it is from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps young people alive? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajev.
At 97 years of age, it is still relatively young.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttermilk that he never tires of.
Under one roof there are eight people, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter. Both are ancient ancestors.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical stomach drinks "armada".
Mirzaeva’s white teeth form a perfect row and hide a long, dark blonde copy under her robe, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like they kept their color on.
"I never used shampoo either," Mirzaeva said.
A month's pension to life is enough.
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never once bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was World War II.
But it all improved when the oar was taken over by the "loved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds weird from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult that is made around the image of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no limit.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajev receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros). This is for the here-in-here ratios the benefit from which you can enjoy well.
And perhaps the long-suffering son of Mirzaeva is right: "Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, they're cared for, and they're happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Disputed demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep disunity.
The future constitution based on the law of the Sharia is being discussed sharply.
The Egyptian president did not save on the floor.
We have to make a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, in front of people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the entire nation, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, hopelessly puzzled in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" on the Nile, granted to the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he temporarily restricted the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate at the American University in Southern California really wants to save is that neither the Egyptians nor the world have any clarity.
Is the judiciary supposed to be deposed?
234 paragraphs, which have been approved in a 15 - hour night marathon by a staunch constitutional assembly with the overwhelming majority of Islamists, are partly disturbing.
As in earlier constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it can be feared that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of the Shariah.
At the very least, it sheds light on the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to the Shariah, it is necessary to consult with the Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
That may not be necessary, but it may mean that clerics will supervise the legislation, which would bring a de facto withdrawal of their own rightfulness to justice.
There's a lot of interpretation in the draft constitution.
The problem is also that the civilian powers of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its moral and values".
This is formulated on the legal side so vaguely that by means of this paragraph the state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
In an understandable speech, it means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the hannobite or slanders the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
What remains unclear, however, is what is shameful and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally doubtful that there is a prohibition on "insulting people".
In this case, is the President's cartoon or a joke at the expense of law enforcement?
A matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Mursi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human voting.
"The Revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the overwhelming Islamist population.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual squalor on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to apply.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej stated that the draft constitution belonged to "the dump of history".
Through the services of brief Twitter reports, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to carry out "a coup against democracy".
"If he announces the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition member Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, our brothers' blood has not yet been punished," Egyptian media quoted Chalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood has declared uprodemonstrations, but out of caution not at Tahrir Square, but after a public prayer on the second bank of the Nile before Cairo University.
She was attended by many women and Salafists who called, "People demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Mursey, "Clean the earth!" and assured them, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The battle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrír, where it all began, would likely cause a state similar to that of the civil war.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brotherhood declared that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had made their voices loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide which way the country is going.
For one thing, the majority are considered to be in favour of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not exist once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is awarded by Hafiza Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-four-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were either in prison or in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Mursi's extension of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he has actually cancelled it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the match of ideological factions in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get back at him.
A protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you cannot control anymore."
Norwegian Rakfisk: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country’s secret of success be associated with a local appetite for extremely stinking fish?
Take a few extra cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie down for a week.
That's how you get the scent of the paralysing smell of the raccoon, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and there is a pervasive smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salty trout fermented in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to meet at a festival dedicated to what they call the best, most subduing food.
"You eat cheese and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than a rakfisk," said Howard.
The drink can smell good.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that's been on a long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, fish were soaked in air-tight barrels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well - fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt dwindled with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Noras were forced to leave their land and seek employment, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, who was much richer than Norway recently, are streaming into the country at work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, even though a relatively odourous part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even though it's expensive, a small glass of beer or a sandwich will get you out at £9 ($14) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and it seems that most people do so.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned by people who are reluctant.
Instead, the shooting is called an "event of July 22nd".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceable country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth is behind the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic prosperity.
We're, as they say, considerate people.
Her English, like the English of most of the people here, is absolutely amazing.
We don't show off, we don't like showing off.
Norway manages its oil wealth very carefully - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial collapse were throwing away money they didn't have, the Norwegians had ropes tight in their town.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the front for something to eat - I've had enough raccoon.
Such a moose burger is certainly something else and is beautifully juicy.
But there's a smelly fish back here tonight.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where a rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for their most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV transmission that has a moderator with a butterfly surrounded by plates with a raccoon.
It's like a Eurovision singing contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Howard."
It's called applause and laughter.
A man might fall out of a chair, perhaps with an aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and at the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked even in the best times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent incoming workers from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential Sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
At the time of the establishment of the outgoing Felipe Calderon, Mexico was doing well, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking hands with the American president, President Pena Niet gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural city of Valle del Bravo, they remember him well.
Citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in the airport and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These motorways are a huge improvement in the face of the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring a real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MP for the side of President Pen Niet, the Institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Ambassador Olver admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there is much to be expected inside of Enriqua Pena Niet.
And he rejects the statement of the opposition characterizing the new president as a human being without material content.
He's a very direct man, very interested in an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a person who can listen.
But on the other side of the state this is not the impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Stuck under highway approaches in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called to help deal with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially violent violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in empty places next to a huge landfill.
At the time of Pena Nieto’s governorship, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieta say that in his office he failed to deal adequately with the problem of women's murder.
And in a worse case, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a lost quarter, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body was washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of blows on it, and the postmortem stiffness had begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the image on the wall next to the cross, where the only word is "justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a pimp.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and notices," he says.
Sherpa, received by President Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised that during his term in office they will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," says Member Alvera of the Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of mistreatment, says the military prosecutor
The D.A. is trying to dissuade Bradley Manning's allegations of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case rejected on the basis of harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the rude treatment alleged to have suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor May Ashden Fein, during a cross-examination of Private Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits Manning had had with his unit officers during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination that occurred during the hearing conducted on the motion for defence rejected the case brought against Manning because of the gross treatment at the time of the detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein passed along with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after meeting with Manning in Quantico prison, where he was held in a surveillance regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officer Manning asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was regarded as "excellent" and overall treatment in the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though officers of Manning directly asked how they were treated, Fein argued.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be dealt with, but they did not.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after they discussed concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I did not mention them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a commission assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The army stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the suicide surveillance regime) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the wardens in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the improved quality of life I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at the naval infantry base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and he passed out once because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very distressing.
"My world crashed only on Arifjan base, on the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantico he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, blanket, nicknames, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying there was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face, when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn around.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint regarding the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he filed in a Thursday statement regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked before the guards and other fellow prisoners in the morning count.
Manning confessed that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when counting.
On Friday’s hearing, Judge Manning stated that he had concluded by order of his guards that he had a blanket to hide, but he admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning confessed that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said the officer said he could use his underwear belt or his nicknames to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning confessed that his underwear, his nicknames, and glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the event of his conviction before a military court whose beginning is expected at the beginning of next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said that he planned Manning to plead guilty to lower crimes and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as valid.
The Pentagon stated that Manning had been held in accordance with the provisions concerning all detainees held in custody with maximum guard.
The charges brought against Manning include aid to the enemy, unlawful use of Internet reporting, transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If charged at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made it through the crowd, and I arrived in the room for an immigration agenda where I encountered a problem.
The rods pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexiconos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So I ended up with the Mexican American sign later.
But that was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's country, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood up for the "Extranjeros" front.
I was thinking about the moment this week that the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited President Obama's White House.
On the program, they had the usual issues to discuss when the leaders of the two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are equally likely to stay in Mexico as they are traveling to the United States.
It wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader to sign half the Mexican territory into the United States under the threat of weapons.
But for Mexicans who think within centuries, not minutes, the comments are everywhere.
So a minute after the U.S. representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how Americans intervene in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will set foot on the war path.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people the country offers opportunities to, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seems, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are now living an American dream, going to good schools, and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living an American dream, not a Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats and view us as an inferior race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they'd never have left him.
And now we would not be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally travelled to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans understand what they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of any.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have any roots.
In Mexico, they look at us like Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and push political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unwilling to deal with their family members in a much closer way.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another cycle of bloodshed suggests that every such event is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary conjectures about who started it, many buildings were destroyed, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, an Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelites and the Palestinians seem to be trapped in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring changed the old order, and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their death - dealing situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be not many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the cease-fire closed on November 21st, the fighting this week has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been ruling in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelites to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the imprisonment of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the saddest and most populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And in fact, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its warring rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can judge very well that time is on their side.
Islamists have gained greater influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a renewed regional power that was once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The prominent people of Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is engulfed around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the party/mile of Hizbollah is ruling, through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly prone to Islamism, can sit Bashar Assad, until Jordan, where the Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, in the southern wing of Israel, he changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the far most populous and central Arab country, the balance in the region.
The Huss Mubarak, a secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be expelled by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s supporters of the hard line will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli missile system The iron dome proved its value and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of the Government, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, in Israel it has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, from a part of the wall that attacks the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian state may once be, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the 22 January election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't fire rockets like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It'll be better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hard line may win, but the Arab spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have too much love for Israel, their primary priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence spending is higher than the expenses of all its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a new war with local superpowers will hardly help new Arab governments to recover their economies.
President Mursi's cooperation with President Barack Obama in achieving a cease-fire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates the denial of Palestinians' rights to self-determination of a barrel of gunpowder, which one day must explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographic situation is further worsening as the Arab population grows.
Bloodguilt against Gaza, which takes place every few years to push Hamas, will be increasingly taxed by diplomatic means.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world and the following newspapers: two states when Israel passes over for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping fire will give pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must sit down to stop the supply of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from the outside must also push for harmony between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations for the creation of the Palestinian State.
President Obama also has his share in getting Israel to the table.
During his first election period, he neglected the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to join the process.
That's sadly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws on ugly cigarette packs entered into force in Australia
Unseemly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are displayed warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, came into force, and branded logos and colors replaced the general olive green boxes with disgusting images of sick body parts and showing children and newborns who are sick as a result of their parents ’ smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the name boxes of the marks printed in the same small letter is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of their appeal.
It's based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking at 26 years of age, 99% of the chances are they'll never start smoking.
"Even for very young children you can see that you understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry strongly lobbyed against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation there will be serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes from silicone used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding laws to Australia's highest court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts describe the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from direct viewing, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you," says Becky Freeman, a research worker in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman noted an increase in social networking marks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it will apply new rules rather than on marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new legislation - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia is significantly trading.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
Now they have spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures don't have any effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I can stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that single boxes make it harder for him to straighten out.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we'll close the shop'," he said and threw his hands away.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
On my last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for the following years is quite annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and child development experts are increasingly coming with praise for boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go in interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us today are constantly attached to a screen, we have no chance of enjoying the boredom.
So should we support boredom?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more leisure time.
But according to Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (The History of Boredy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact my boredom has a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription was found on the walls of Pompeii concerning boredom, from the first century of our anniversary.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the York University of Ontario, Canada.
After considering research literature and presenting the idea to the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would please me, but I was not able to do it".
The difference between boredom and apathy is that a person is not involved in anything, but he wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything about apathy.
It says that the core of boredom is "a disturbance in the attention process associated with the bad mood and the feeling of slow-running time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, people tend to see a problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bordeaux in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment where participants listened to a tape on which a person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so silently that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or seductive task, it can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not to wake up."
In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and snorting that he often looks at as a sign of boredom can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more alert.
"The study shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and maintain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all had boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the loudspeaker, a particularly long film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
In order to help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the Boredom Proneness Scale.
The pillar includes questions like "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally inconclusive.
In 1991 Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knew that "adulting is a top time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to play gambling or to abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nuda is a way of braining how to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should be doing.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn to have fun but gain more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical of her.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are away from the reach of constant squabbles of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly being restimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise shuts down."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and a football player from southeastern Colorado, faces charges of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - holding a few grams of marijuana and smoke that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he was driving with several friends in Lamar, on plans near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After finding a policeman in a marijuana car, Mr Orozco was issued with a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - minor offences in which $100 is fined each - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote on the legalisation of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana offences have already been abolished here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The Police Department has ceased to accuse adults aged 21 and older of holding a small quantity that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing marijuana cases and still accuse people of being held.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver are voting towards the Western mountains to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana trades in their municipalities.
"This thing is going so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The governors in the state of Washington are gossiping.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is first in front of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State liquor license board.
But as Mr. Smith has allowed, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we can follow," he said.
The Washington Law, so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which the state licensing system will not yet exist, but legal restraint will.
And there are hard mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to export the State directive on "corresponding approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in cannabis up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"It will not be more difficult to place licensed trade in cannabis than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Hemp, a recently established research group.
On 21 November, police chief Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers, informing them that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute crimes for holding a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years of age and that the police "with immediate effect" will stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, he faces charges of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute a criminal offence that was a criminal offence at the time of their occurrence," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer accuses adults of holding a small amount.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all pending detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time pursuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the Colorado voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And opposite reactions across the country revealed a deep disunity between local officials in view of this great state-owned green experiment.
For the district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants of marijuana possession, and a local spokesman for the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to view a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are best placed to become national testing cases for the legalisation of drugs.
The defence and state authorities are planning new borders for legalised sales and are also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The marijuana legalization attorneys hope the Ministry of Justice will stand by.
Despite several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, which attracted attention, the federal government mostly left in operation trades in medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to go door-to-door to capture a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will oppose the state's regulatory trades with recreational marijuana permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to President Obama's administration.
Several of the cities of Colorado are not waiting for the federal procedure.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana trade, even if it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where we will issue a license to someone and then we will have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our municipality voted against this supplement.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, against what it voted for.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today's university students are not the only ones being attacked in their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about college at Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother were studying at the university, which I thought was the world's largest home of knowledge, a modern, sophisticated Greek symposium that motivated two pillars of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, I had packed my suitcases for two weeks after entering Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, and I went back to the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson reveredly declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from the stolen pots.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this lullaby of supposed enlightenment it was both big and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly built advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I, a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask me why I'm only pulling it out now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right from Wednesday suffer similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative Oxford students is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Association of Junior Yearbooks (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political opinions they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcomed".
They request the establishment of a position in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that they can communicate their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary programme entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student political activity, which has made the conservative a freak and neo-Nazi.
The show featured a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OCCA), who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.
In other colleges conservative students say that because of the introduction of higher education, they are treated as "promised lambs".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday news that "the left-wing influence at universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old elected President Ouca Stephanie Cheryl says that there has been a deterioration in the access of JCR members to people on the right from Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he said.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one.
I entered September 1986, 18-year-old and in a debilitating way shy.
Hatred against the conservative side was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had refused to grant the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in the financing of higher education.
Atmospherics would also be troubled by Stalinists.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students were meeting with each other and the teachers, I got a taste of the diaper that was supposed to come.
I found out that not only do professors of silence approve of the swelling of conservative pupils, but they also participate.
The policy of the mining strike, privatisation and government's opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa has been introduced into the wood-covered auditoriums.
My first lecture was on the translation of French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've been through a lot of trouble.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very gallant.
"Thatcher refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were moaning.
I've got tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, that is, if you are not too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt said.
I went back to my room crushed.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight click on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being conservative is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later at the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (what irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
He beats each other up, doesn't he?
I felt like they must have felt gay before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet similar thinking people just after dark?
Would I have to change into a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they developed as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's advisor to foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
This place hated for its provinciality and pettyness and for its propensity for a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he took the post of professor at Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel from Oxford to my parents ’ home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased Metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a dreamy city.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes were flushed.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted from frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience has deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the course of the course, when another history professor declared in absolute seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing inside the studio, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me and I called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-term.
A nail in the coffin of my Oxford career knocked over my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns of Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I snuggled inside, and after five minutes, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a smug weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and toxicity in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers came, but also to this day behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Works", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Nate Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host the exhibition Valentina Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Works", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," she says with her irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "or signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will last until March 3rd, repeats private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important noblemen, from Princess Salima Aga Chan through the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise: from the simple tailor from the town of Vogher in northern Italy to the idol of international "bohemian dumplings".
It's nothing wrong to like royal families.
"They don't at least touch a pack of cigarettes into a great carpet, like some wonderful celebrity pop-music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy plenty and elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance over fame.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazz plays Valentina
Don't forget the charism of the designer, even the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been a long time since we went to him for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything, he reverberated and felt his spirit.
All the invited ones were able to feel important and loved," recalls the top model who began working with him during the Paris Week of Supreme Fashion in 1995.
"Never goes out of style because his proposals are works of art," he concludes.
Show of birth
Gravani's life is not a story of possession, but of truly restored love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a special 70-metre-long passage that offers an exchange of roles: the visitor changes into a model and marches the passage to observe the "community" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces wear as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore in "Night", or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience of models shines names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, "you can't forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's husbands.
"I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women, because it undermines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Ferria.
"I really like the colors that he uses, they brighten up a lot and give the spark to his face.
The proportions are perfect."
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampala d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally met in the late '90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentine to the occasion of the celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Eduardo de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had dresses with bellows, chopped-up life, and no arms.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is easy to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has saved the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The golden comb of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
The creation of these silk garments required four months of work and 25 "holls" (as the designer calls his shives) to create ivory color with pearls on them, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the boundary of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "return of clients from the high society".
Valentino is now his best example during the years of elite "savoire-être".
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and distinguished by the order of the Honorary Legion collects as much honor as any of the husbands of his clients.
"My attention was always drawn to his choice, calm, adjusted and perfect appearance," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago for a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was wonderful, time left no trace of him."
If the princess says so...
The hardest craft in the world: cheese carriers in the area of the volcano Kawah Ien
For four euros, carriers in the area of the Indonesian volcano gamble with their life and health as they carry 70 kilos of cheese down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting cheese from the volcano Kawah Ien in the east of the island of Java.
As a result, it has to blow every day to the bottom of the crater, where it escapes the raw gases from the inside of the Earth and when it is in contact with the air, it passes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur, which together weighs up to 70 kilos, he carries them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets along hard stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for exhausted carriers to climb the turtle’s pace up because they maintain balance and carefully reflect on their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives as it happened to a French tourist who fell off the Kawah Ien rocks years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ien earn five cents for each kilo of cheese they earn
When they're up there, they're smashing their way around tourists who take pictures of them like they're monkeys in the circus, and they're tired of taking heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company put down a little bit below, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
This is a company called PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of cheese.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this growth has its place in everyday life and is used to produce lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening sugar.
"Because they usually carry 70 kilos, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each time," explains Anto, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is destroyed at the end, but it can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
Although it appears to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is a triple of what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wages of miners are very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees are paid for coffee collection (1.2 rupees) per day, and the salary in 14 days is two million rupees (167 rupees)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a gardener.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and work was not as difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing in Indonesia as the cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, shortness of breath, still coughing, and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto is risking his life three times a day in the volcano Kawah Ien, whose sulphur has already begun to collect its tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
My asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that are escaping from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," promises more than permanent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man with fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the work of carriers.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the cheese does not stop turning out at night and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto turns into a crater and lights up a little light road that he has fastened on his helmet and bought it himself for his money.
About 400 stretchers carry cheese from the bottom of the crater on the shoulder
Although the company has high incomes, the production of sulphur due to cost savings has neither mechanised nor provided equipment to carriers operating on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photo fee, which, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (€1.2), is being selected by nature park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle and not for people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades, since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work as long as possible because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and catches the miners in thick fumes coming out of the volcano, the miners are so insistent that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulder caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who weighs his basket on his back, can carry only 50 kilos at 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his colleagues evict 15 tons of cheese in the volcano, which then three trucks drive a steep road between the goose and the warehouse in Tamsara, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares and opens her mouth wide, with a few teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, he also earns by lowering the cheese.
Time is running out, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world endures from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore wants a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans speculate that they have no children, careers, stress, and living and education costs.
"Singapur's population needs growth."
I'm married, and I'm a patriot, and you're my wife and you're a patriot, so let's fulfill our civic duty and give birth to a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the commercial on menthol candy, but still - or perhaps that's why - the video was widely distributed in Singapore earlier this year on YouTube.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local conjectures of the type "we'll put the cove in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency that created the video hopes that they will be able to point out this problem in a funny way.
Art director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people "fulfill their civic duty".
"It's only about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a subject we had to touch.
We knew that the government had tried many things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible, such as putting together a rap to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it lightly is the Singapore government.
Every year, he spends $1,300 on encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides as much as $15,000 per child, renews maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore is currently 1.2 children per woman with regard to population breakdown.
Finally, the birth rate of the value of 2, which is considered to be the rate of recovery, exceeded in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the union of marriage and family of the National Population Office, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options regarding life goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy has made a drastic effort to increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has caused disfavor among the local population.
On some Singapore web pages you can see undiscovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapore recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate business.
The City Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can promote youthful lifestyles and repel developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers development company, claims that their shoe boxes sell far faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, by selling for days to weeks faster than larger-scale houses.
That's why our cash flow is much better."
However, it accepts that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, talking to the Singaporeans working in a financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a major impact.
"People are still stressed out, houses are expensive, as are education, so many people put off," says a young official.
"The rest of you have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever government is trying to force citizens to have children, they are ultimately Singaporeans who have the last word for starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or a "area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance".
What is privacy for a person under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from ElPeridiodico reported five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" on a personal level and as "user name and password" when it was a social network.
"My biggest secret would not be published," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom may know about it, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing with the FBI.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up an account on Twitter so that I could express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14 - year - old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them pointed to anything, nor did they want an address or a phone number.
"If they insist on me or demand it from me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These boys are not strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"They blackmailed a friend on a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never found out who he was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't check in.
"You just activated your private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of people known in awkward or awkward situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to get the right orientation on social networks, they need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a tool for searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Pransky, a graduate of teaching at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Migrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are only learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at the age when they are not yet mature".
Also in order to be smart - as far as the environment is concerned - at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras also mentions some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, would you like it if someone published your picture the way you published your friend's?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
When you tag people in party photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone need to know all the time what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they must behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"A man is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and the same should be done on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first - grade teacher, and an education counselor, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If she understands every delusion, they have a good basis to talk to the children about the consequences that the establishment of an online account can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guardia is of the view that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "do not speak to strangers".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru ended today without a Declaration from Lima, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven present presidents.
Efe repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Offices, who initially determined that the document would be published at the end of the summit, stated that it would be published later on the Peruvian government website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollant Humal in a few short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message "confidential session, audio transmission is blocked".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by press speakers from some governments who were present, but not by the Peruvian speaker.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participants with presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail with a "conclusion statement" from the summit, but it is only a statement by President Humalog, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and, even on this occasion, the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, although the press was zealously required.
On the official pages of the ASPA it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were broadcast, but they totally prevented the flow of information.
The summit concluded, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru President Ollanta Humal and Chile President Sebastián Piñer met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing the defence speech of both sides to discuss the dispute that opened up Lima against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humalog, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, a convention and international courts," Piñer added and welcomed President Humalog with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents of the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on maritime borders with Nicaragua, and that decision was considered entirely incorrect by Colombia.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rousseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of then President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humal was charged with opening the morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The President read the final document informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects were planned between the South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries would "take important steps towards a goal in the form of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended".
He reported that actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters" were supported.
When Europe is in crisis, "it is not meant to have economic consolidation (Latin America) of a winning nature, but it is supposed to serve to expand our productivity and show our people a better future," Humalog added.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of various places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian President said in a read speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the transverse axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute that is disputed by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (S Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will be able to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and most comprehensive form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to take part in the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Neta.
In the framework of the summit, the EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the area.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal where "from South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on state television TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now there is virtually one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the members of the countries of Unasur support.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community, however, there are still areas of return that want to bring us back to the past," he noted.
The President of Ecuador, inter alia, said he agreed to the repurchase of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states would be reduced and those who had signed the San José Pact on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"Those who are in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States," Equator's reference to political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be interviewed in Swedish territory for alleged sexual delicacy, while "the Swedish own legislation allows for a video conference call to be conducted by the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since the moment he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But the threat is that his physical and mental condition will worsen because he is closed in a small space without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
That would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that discussions had taken place with London to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón runs a series of procedures at various European offices," he said.
He said, "If the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it'll all be over."
And if Sweden listens to Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation allows, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be put to an end tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press and explained that he certainly does not tolerate "subdimension, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of free press are not us, mean and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in profit, pressure and blackmail services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that not even such journalists, "no bankers, no hegemonic country and no bourgeoisie control Ecuador", and suggested that if re-elected, "he will continue to change in the right direction and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding the membership of the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and pusism wrapped up in legality" because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered the "quite appropriate" wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the verdict is not accepted.
"It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to assess them from a wide perspective in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope in settling the maritime border dispute that is settled in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to look for international instances if both countries commit to a verdict, however hard it may be".
With regard to the possibility that he would run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to go in line for a third term, he noted that he perceived this option "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult".
Correa announced that if he loses his election in February 2013, he will be out of public life.
"I have never personally cared much, but an unfair situation such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be rectified by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential period and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, it's the same for me.
I've already made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Madur, who says that President Chávez left for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the state of the President," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador today attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a flash struck me," she relates in her memories of a moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "relent a little", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness himself on his thighs and began to inform himself about it, with the intention that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is no doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came into it in 1994 after several battles with disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) since the age of 22, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then neither did the director of the hospital of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) say goodbye, "because he had a cut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and live full life.
However, there are many people who do not know and lose their disease until the virus has destroyed the organism and broadcast the immune system, and they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "means a great success that the duration of life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, with this information confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist at HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the extent to which patients are affected by the immune system, which is diagnosed with the disease, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "live without problems in maintaining treatment until 75 years of age", the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth noting that the average length of life of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died on AIDS has decreased significantly from 6 678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS) year), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS.
Only in the state of Jalisco have 255 people died in 2011 and until this year 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die as a result?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of drugs. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, or the late stage of the disease."
She adds: "Nine out of ten patients come in when an associated infection occurs, and all we have to do to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease first, and therefore it is necessary to offer tests to determine the disease to all those who ask for it".
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a private laboratory only because his friend did so, and despite his low age, he had already contracted AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather die three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsiblely, I look after myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the journalist MILENIO JALISCO today in World AIDS Day to motivate those who are afraid.
"Let them take the tests, if they've risked it, let them know that if they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the panel
Health programs and ordinary citizens are a major disaster, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is looking for information on HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "condoms have actually increased, previously given us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Teens are among the most susceptible to new diseases.
"What do you want?" is a common issue of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health professionals who want to avoid teens, says the reporter.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution should be changed, not only by the counters, but by the hundred in the public toilet dispensers, in places where young people often go.
"It is not a promotion of promiscuity.
It's not even about paying for beer and motels, as Governor Emilio González reacted to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who are already leading a sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) have been reported.
This situation marks the fourth place in Mexico in the new and found cases of AIDS and the 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of the disease is sexually transmitted, 6% by blood route and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people on one registered case who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Groupo Vitro's debt under the Mexico tender, creates a slight precedent for any national firm with branches in a neighbouring country and the issue of solvency.
Therefore, the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of a judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale at the Northern Texas Court of Appeal leaves a Mexican company without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the second bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against three irregularities to the main Mexican glass manufacturer.
The introduction is to say that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is to determine the judicial procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, which is determined by the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the vote of the branches of the internal enterprise structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority would not have been reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws accept this option.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Audit Institute guaranteed internal debts.
In addition, it is true that even after the vote was taken out of branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. funds of "sup", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This data is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different point of view, Vitro blames the court on the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - on the background of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, González Sady's family company will appeal for a new assessment directly with the Court of Appeal to ensure that the evaluation takes place in full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If it fails here, it will require, as a remedy, a review of the process by a higher authority, in this case, the United States Supreme Court.
In the case, it is serious that the court has ignored a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae service detailing the Vitro procedure under the Competition Act, indicating that the company has been relieved by resorting to agreements signed by both countries in order to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Law.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, which is the rules for international insolvency cases which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: Penalty for Vitro and the State.
Overall evaluation
Without notice, the Mexican Air Force's criminal notification against the former owner of Gaston Azcárrag Andradem, who was ordered from fraudulent negotiations, was on the table for several months, and the vessel has already passed, according to a professional organisation of pilots.
The institution headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Maureenau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to the Authority, it has systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by the latter, in which it selected 198 million pesos from Fideikomis F/589 from IXE.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of shares by the Professional Hotel Administration (Administrativora Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcárraga Andrade is a major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The siege of the Dragon Martu
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of associations met at the site of the Universidad de Caribe, in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution centre with products from a "land with a big wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, Canacintra (Camara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unify the governors of the south-east zone to stand up against a monumental area that would partially devastate protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of business with ACTA
The request by the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed in Japan the ACTA Trade Agreement, known under the English acronym ACTA, under the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propedad Industrial) has been removed.
It is well known that despite the fact that the Senate itself has excluded the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect those short-terms, the development company Homex places on the market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of the four identical offerings to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive is born
The merger of leading companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has created an association with the business name Competival, which will aim to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world-class Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been connected to this hall sport for over 60 years and has processed the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes does.
Reyes was before he was brain-punched in 2008 on a wheelchair, lit up in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a junior player, player of the national BSN basketball league, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as I was the president of the national BSN League in the 1990s, the national team general and the chairman of the Federation," Reyes recalled when visiting reporters of the newspaper Primer Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has been living for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and reminders of his long career, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest movement of all guards, those who resemble his actions in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the championships - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
Then the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gaussie, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon a victory at the championship, Gaussa would contribute to the next one."
The championship, when Los Vaqueros played Gaussa for the team, enjoyed, but only for a long time, since he was already president of the basketball Federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's place on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world championship in 1990, where we ended up in the quarter, but we should have had the bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final pitch," said Reyes.
Is the team from the World Cup in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was a national team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we beat up a team of the United States that was pretty much like the one that blew out the bronze on the world championship.
The team had not only Mincy, Gaussie, Ramon Rivase, Fica López and Piculína (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quiote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition but who was able to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy was a team of Olympic qualifications in 1995 in Argentina's Neuquén.
With players on the soupist, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and Junior Player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded from the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from the international tournaments are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his acting in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flore Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmatia and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much from young people.
Which success do you consider to be the greatest in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s the national league of BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the distribution of youth categories by region.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, judges' assistants and referees.
Nice to meet you.
What do you do now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my day, I enjoy grandkids, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, world famous John Ross Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, in which he embodyed a man who acted irresistibly and was manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewing's crude oil magnate in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died according to an official family announcement provided by Dallas Warner Bros to Associated Press on Friday afternoon for cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment she died in the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his whole life," Linda Gray said in a statement.
The Hagmans diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a debilitating tumor in his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman celebrated himself on TV as a decent guy in a light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (gina) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in films included roles that were well accepted by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colours.
But it was up to Hangman's masterly performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star peak.
The dramatic series of CBS stations about the Ewing clan and others around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jara?", which was supposed to raise expectations about the work of full emotion when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations of viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in sazko offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in watching.
The November part of 1980, in which the answer was revealed, was watched on average by 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most popular entertainment show since the end of the MASH series in 1983, which was followed by 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin fired on J.R. (which was played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on the canvas and beyond".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten pieces of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second row have been completed and the sixth was just rolling," the television station reported.
Right after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or the TNT station about how the show would proceed.
A native from Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who radiated in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried happiness on theatre scenes in New York City and then served in England from 1952 to 1956 in aviation.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, who he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could hurt or hurt anyone," said Prens Association.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he assisted the patients who were afraid.
"I work for them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense "Don't worry, it'll be a little awkward, but you'll be well."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the Mayan calendar's "long number", which is due December 21st, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what would happen to him in the next few months: a catastrophal hurricane named Sandy, a budgetary disaster that some call "long Armageddon", and a growing conflict in which Israel is drawn, a place in which Christians theorizing about the end of the world begin the Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most japocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When a person discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means bad to an apocalyptic thinking good.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, expert assistant Barry Vacker holds the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We understand why these thoughts expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how different from real life examples.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a professional assistant to art history and anthropology, were brought together to organize a course with the simple name End of the World.
"We do not join the '2012' because we always count on the possibility of having a course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatful destruction", students must study, create projects and perform final tests.
In Penn State the final test will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"Standed out in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students who entered 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mail questions about whether there was still room.
Students themselves ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Rutgers University in Camden, 23 years old Bridged Robinson, a student in the field of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
So apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour where it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessing student, including a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project discussed Mayan predictions and in some way we are twisting them," said Julie Zeglenová, 21-year-old student of the last year at the University of Temple of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that reaches back centuries, which people react to changing their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The bloom of these speculations has caused the internet.
"Otherwise, people don't think about it," he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English - speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew there was a course on "the end of the world", answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and suggested an exception to the highest authority.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had been discussed over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or to philosophy that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period at which the world would disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several of them said they intended to go to the "end of the world" ceremony.
"I'm going to call a few friends to laugh together," said 20-year-old communication student Samir Ford.
