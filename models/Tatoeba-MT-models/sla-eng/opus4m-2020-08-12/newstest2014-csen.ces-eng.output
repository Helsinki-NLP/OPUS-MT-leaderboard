The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money for repairs of decaying highway networks, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that monitor every mile that the motorist leaves and which transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate the obsolete system of financing American main roads.
Normally, the lean design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of a variety of associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small boxes that would record the miles captured and perhaps even where you are going – and then use this information to form a tax measure.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move to the system in which the driver pays for a mile [km] of the road he travels over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS surveillance, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It is not a matter of when we can choose much," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, who plans to start monitoring the stolen kilometres for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is for.
I'd like to raise the fact that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay at pump stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars will drive a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of payments for a lost mile.
"It appears to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is popular with urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change the behaviour patterns of drivers, which can help, for example, limit traffic congestion and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers take this system into account when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Schuster (Representative of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also saw this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The representatives of the Free Market of the Reason Foundation are also inclined to believe that drivers will pay for the lost miles.
"It is not a tax that will disappear in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for the strategy in the organisation Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to pay for a kilometer.
The US Senate approved a pilot project last year for $90 million, which would include about 10,000 cars.
The House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means to offend many kilometres outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax for miles lost, instead of taxes for gasoline.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York's looking into the project right now.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight cars.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, is studying with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, is not just a protagonist.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with equipment, the drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
"The Big Brother surveillance and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who manages the strategy and operation at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-blown monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a huge heavy-duty technological infrastructure that inevitably expands to the records of day-to-day visits and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few countries that is trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the car will run, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance).
This company was initially not involved in the government's assistance in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging insurance market where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would drive.
But this device, which is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only adds limited amounts of information that are regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do so if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programs.
They're much cheaper and less subtle ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will come to this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra charges at parking hours to provide insurance by mileage and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"The motorists will be willing to join because of the value of the beneficiaries they are offered," the city's projection document says.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all the discussions on the payment per kilometre are not just a huge problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the Bay of San Francisco say that Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by increasing the gas tax.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles who do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"No radical operations are needed when it is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Sobotka negotiates for the CzechSSD.
Social democracy is slutting, people and grandmothers are talking together, and they're preparing a joint procedure.
If the Social Democrats are confused within a few weeks, they will be sitting at the negotiating table with the perfectly integrated partners who will put on the table a complete list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
ČSSD's envoys will then either swallow acidic coalition grapes, or nod on a vicious minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days in a wave of sympathy, struck for the first time.
Yesterday, he failed to master the political chemium and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator behind the party is only him, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the play and now to the citizens.
He shouldn't lie, in his personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hasek, the most recent leader of social democracy.
He added he didn't get any credit for being the first vice president.
"I will communicate my decision on 10 November at the VVV," said Hasek.
The vice-president of the Czech Republic Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jerome Tejc spoke similarly.
Of course, he warned that he had been elected just two days ago.
The two MPs then announced that they would do anything to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound in one voice.
"I am a member of ČSSD for 15 years, I have always been loyal to her brand and respected the decisions of the foreign authorities."
That's another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget in his appeal to Sobotko's resignation and exclusion from the negotiating team that 57 percent of August's UVV had fallen asleep on the fact that Bohuslav Sobotka was a party's candidate for prime minister?
However, ČSSD's chief made a powerful army of enemies by calling the VVV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a variety of gossips and rumors, possibly recall the real mistakes of Sobotko's political career.
There will be powerful washing of dirty laundry, signs of dark alliances between the chlorobaron Zdenek Bakala and the Sobotka Wing.
A friendly relationship between Boguslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radko Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes erupt in the South Moravian or Moravian Silesian organization ČSSD.
The words of the Istrian Prime Minister and Sobotkov's ally Peter Kaynar are sure: "I signed Chartu 77 to prevent the country from being ruled by idiots."
If the UVV had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritualize their functions.
Traitors will burn their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning CzechSSD chief will then end with the name Bohuslav Pyrrhha.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Socha: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just breathes out, "It's hard."
Cooperation with the organization team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so fast.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information on the essentials.
For example, for three months now, we have been complaining about how individual villages will be officially marked so that we can do a number of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
There's a lot of things they keep communicating.
Is there at least an Olympic village delivered?
But it's not a catastrophic state anymore.
We were walking around empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does that mean, they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, so that's what happened a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that by the time we arrive there on January 26th as a prelude, there will still be glue.
And if they don't, then what?
President Putin, would you think he'd send an army there?
That's probably how it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that Olympic village = Potemkin's village.
Rather, they may not be able to complete the details, for example, if they do not make the journey.
Maybe they'll have a trip in such a state that we'll have to take a pair of London game wands with us.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there's about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the carnivores will go in that three-way they took out.
Martin Sáblík's speedster also needs to be questioned, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should be there by 26 January.
What houses in the Olympic village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things on the subway so that we wouldn't just believe the blueprints.
We are preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a common agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, his plan beats the giant secret dumps.
Winter sports fans are already cutting meters to start Olympic games in Sochi, while others are increasingly concerned about preparing them.
The Russian Olympics, even though they don't start until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparation and conduct of the games will not at least disrupt nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be heading in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, however, the Russians had a very high - ranking platypus, and Canada’s Olympics have entered the history of the Olympics as being more illogical to the environment.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken for granted.
Reporters from AP agency last week discovered a huge landfill of building material in the village of Achstyr near Sochi.
So they found a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foams already in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have disappeared and the landfill has disappeared.
Just for a second.
Last week, reporters were given a view of the landfill about the size of three football pitches.
Not only has there been a number of such places in the area, the British newspaper The Times described.
There are Russian railways, a state monopoly that builds about 60km between Soča airport and sports resort.
The company, which already enjoyed 280 billion rubles, led one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the landfill was founded by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are desperate.
According to the people of Achstyr, all of them have been driving trucks full of waste material for three months and nights.
According to experts, the waste contaminates the local river Mzymt, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"Water from here contaminates juicy water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said the British newspaper Vladimir Kimajev of the environmental nonprofit organisation EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian Organising Committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
To compare: Socha games will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 amounted to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working at an exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth on a protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers align themselves with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support the Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with their parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, the property itself being somewhat weighed down.
It was further demanded that there be two generations in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clear space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly weighing plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In creating the proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories linked to the place."
"Three different features of the house are connected several times through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' home is on the garden level with an old blueberry to which family traditions and memories are related.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, different from the various final façades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed using panels of boards, the part where the office is, is rejected white and the remaining elements remain in clean concrete production without further modification.
Many walls of the house are completely glassed, making the interior of the house very connected with the exterior.
The home of the parents, namely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in a young couple's household.
A young couple enters the house at the main entrance to the hall and then climbs up the stairs to their quarters.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their constructions allow a lot of natural light to fade through them.
That's why the architects tried to separate the house from the others and impress him with something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as an open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
Only the glass wall with sliding doors separates it from the terrace.
Living area with a dining and kitchen area in a young couple's household.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely crosses the terrace, from which is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the highest floor is defined in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house at the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall, and then climb up the stairs from there.
Defend academic freedom, it applies to Zeman and ODS.
Repeatedly in recent months, I have called for open letters from students, teachers and the management of secondary and higher education schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign conducted by President Milos Zeman at school.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to give a lecture by the Honourable President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci during the pre-election period, even received an appeal in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the Czech Republic's national holiday.
Here is a list of school leaders who were not brave enough to visit Miloš Zeman: Technical University in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now in Pardubice meeting with the continuation of policy enforcement in higher schools.
The newly elected ODS Member, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and also seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying as the mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD's Haytmans, who simultaneously forged the role of an MP and a hejtman, and as well as they degrade both professions?
Because you're telling people that they can handle both of these challenging functions on the left back.
I know, we have a case here of Michael Hasek who manages even a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly an example of a person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpanka Franíková, who rather left the post of parliamentary office so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's post is that the combination of functions will break the political integrity of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubic ODS sees your current performance on both posts as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your school without becoming a dean.
I think your students will have the same opinion as I do and the Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters in the next election will be counting on you.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice, they don't add cabbage bubbles, they don't add chemistry to it.
More than a thousand tonnes of acidic cabbages want to be produced in Slovakia's Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October, and it'll take about six months.
He's been making healthy treats here since 1925 in a traditional way, so he's been walking right in the big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our employees will find a 10-mile route for the shift.
Each of the ten tanks includes fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the head of the Slovak Fruta Fruta David Kladroba race.
The cabbage heads are taken directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclav.
Fruit employees then clean the vegetables, remove the costs and throw them into the ring.
From there, already chopped cabbage falls into pools with a six-meter depth, where they work tirelessly on hookers dressed in white clothes and shavings.
That's how they seal out the unwanted air.
The last layer of cabbage will be covered with a sail and loaded with water.
"The green ring will then betray six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of leaven-supporting substances," said Director Kladroba.
Natural processes correspond to domestic production, individual layers of workers spill salt and cumin.
The cabbage is on its way to the filling line after the fermentation.
It is packed in a sweet, acidic infusion into bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies oxygenated cabbages primarily to the domestic and Slovak markets.
He also registers his interest in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence snitch, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German Ambassador Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who was handed to the media Friday in Berlin, states: “Despite my efforts to prove positive, my government continues to act as fugitives to the opposition and seeks to criminalise political acts with heavy lawsuits that give no room for defence. ”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges raised by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find a way to do so. ”
The tension between the U.S. and Germany began to rise when an allegation arose that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament that runs the parliamentary panel that oversees reporting, said that if there was any chance of hearing Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US”, this should be done.
Mr Sträbel, Member of Parliament for the German side of the Greens, published on his Twitter post a photo of him with Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was escorted by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former NSA contractor, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe" there, said a member of parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a severe and persistent campaign involving the persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression ” gave him courage.
Citizens at large and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an unjustifiable system of widespread public service surveillance.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved".
We're sorry to kill you, but we're innocent, the Red Khmer boys are defending themselves.
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Red Khmer Rouge and Kheeu Samphan was the former head of state.
Under the governments of the Red Khmers, which in 1975 to 1979 relied on a mixture of Maoism and Nationalism, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population there.
This commander of the notorious S-21 prison gave the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the actual extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything and then intervene and remedy the situation," Khieu Samphan announced in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Red Khmer Quadratics "to treat people wrongly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" to the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told AFP that she could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted of guilt."
"She doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subjects wouldn't have killed," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than monsters."
The court was also to see the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer Ieng Sara regime, who died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found an incompetent trial for dementia in September 2012.
The leader of the Red Khmer Rouge Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge a sum of up to $100 for the storage of a hand luggage on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 per hand luggage and $2 per coffee or soda, although on Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new fee for hand luggage applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says he will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if the passengers wait with payment until the entrance to the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's spokeswoman said that a hundred dollar fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payments in advance.
"We would not like to choose this fee," she said.
Air carriers began to charge their first and second luggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and packed in hand luggage hidden in storage space as much as possible, so there was often no space in this space.
Fees are one of the ways passengers learn to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the point of this new fee really is not to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the front gate of Frontier can bring a luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the front will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the website and the cancellation procedures would be adjusted to ensure that passengers would know about the fee before they came to the gate.
Frontier’s new fee for its hand luggage will not be valid until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who demand it should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional cost of luggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
However, most of the fees for hand luggage were not affected.
Spirit Airlines first paid for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegian Air followed suit.
The only company with such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says Air Traffic Advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s manual luggage fee would amount to USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former head of the Midwest Airlines company, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met the unusual charge of Spirit for hand luggage.
"Arriving was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth and fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance took place in a flash."
Frontier will also apply the charges for coffee, tea, soda and juice following the example of Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be added for free.
The water will continue to be served free.
In 2008, US Airways briefly attempted to impose the charges for drinks, but after the passengers complained of it seven months later, it did not give up and no other significant airline imitated it.
Frontier's last move to pay for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy the flight directly from this airline is its last attempt to direct customers directly to their website.
Air carriers pay internet travellers such as Orbitz from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier did not move further in this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought through an internet travel agency only half a mile under the loyalty programme.
On Wednesdays, she cut the reward for the miles she ran to 25 percent of the miles of the road.
So the journey with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased through an internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
Customers are also allowed to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales dropped by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
Republic seeks to solve Frontier’s financial problems by selling this airline.
The NSA does not blame hackers for the crash, but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some said on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov sites were not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by an attack by the DDoS (distributed service rejection) is not true.
Earlier this evening, the sensors of online servers recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the pages are still unavailable for some users.
Previously, the NSA spokesman for ABC News reported that the Agency's internal sensitive networks were not at all at risk.
The speaker said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for excluding NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target web site with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls.
This cyber tactics are relatively simple and the sense of the attacks is not to infiltrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, formerly nicknamed No such agency, has become the main focus of public attention and the target of bite criticism in the past months on the undetection of NSA secret files from the Agency and their disillusionment by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency sparked earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
Bombardier’s profit has fallen as a result of a drop in supplies and orders
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday a 15 % decrease in net profit, which is due to a lower number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
In addition, Bombardier, based in Montreal, has not published any aviation test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations since next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and thus raised the question of whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not fill the estimates, and stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange dropped by 8 percent.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from "higher returns" on Thursday to "performance of the sector" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we expected smaller aircraft deliveries mostly, the profit margin in the area of transport has greatly disappointed us," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market scepticism will increase over this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will break into the bottom of the market, which are now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March, and after a few months of delay in September, the first flight took place.
However, the number of compulsory CSeries orders reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director, Pierre Beaudoin, expected that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Leaders also assured analysts and media Thursday that the programme was proceeding as planned.
‘The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,’ said Beaudoin in a conference call and noted that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the update and we did.
That's what's going to happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that implementation will be moved to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
From 172 million USD, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter of September, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted yields for one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnout has dropped marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, he had only added 45 aircraft during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low receipt of orders and the overall state of the market have disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Profits in the aviation industry decreased by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said that the profits in this division increased by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion by 30 September, which is a marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
Leaders stated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette, decreased by $8.5 per cent during Thursday afternoon’s trade to $4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a ten percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
A cocaine lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information on to the king of the underworld of Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster about a major police investigation because he feared that his drug addiction would come out, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had to provide sensitive information on the investigation of his drug smuggling activities after becoming a cocaine suspect to the head of the subworld of Neil Scarborough.
A lawyer whose name was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated as the best lawyer was arrested at home in 2011, following the police surveillance of Scarborough, who had been represented in previous drug proceedings.
The police saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular drug user in Class A.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he sought to obtain with regret information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were then monitored in a large investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police detained heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) reported to criminals for fear of coming to his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, faced a shameful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty after three weeks of trial of defending justice in two cases.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to holding cocaine.
The lawyer fell after Scarborough's police investigation revealed that he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspects watched, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place drugs of 60 percent purity under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Then Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, having a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer went home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
In court it was reported that traces of Class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but he denied the use of cocaine, and he said that he was talking to a suspected drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation was part of a “confidential communication”.
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all arrested and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him for work matters at home.
However, the court heard that after key arrests he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than an attorney in the criminal field? ”
Mr Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who's supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation sought as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, he dishonored it.
He got too close with some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta refused and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, after hearing police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire, he said: “Mr. Ditta, a criminal lawyer in the criminal area, himself, became a criminal when he started getting drugs from organized criminals. ”
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups, which gave him the task of gathering valuable information on police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire confidence and confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire led an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstructing justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminal to justice.
This case should serve all criminals as a warning that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of association in order to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta organized an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream work would be to legally represent clients from the death cell block in America, as a guest at dinner he wished Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for work he cited inequality.
He was negotiating a government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babish.
In the elections, the people won fourteen members, i.e. only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of YES.
However, they enter into negotiations on the government at least with one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to speculate on the outline of a possible coalition, Jan Kasal - a man who has agreed to the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be a reminder of the first negotiation in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal then," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"It is a horrifying report and it is appropriate to ask what Parliament will prevent it from simply removing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the paper, which considers the bill to be a non-constitutional one, said.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the CapitalFM Group, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be pre-empted because it is extended by the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us out, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star daily, the bill's proposal actually gives the government “complete control over the media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “has sustained a severe wound” and criticise the bill's proposal as “solid”.
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of the Islamic gunman at the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the authorities was reversed by the Kenyan media when it broadcasts a security camera on which troops sent to the site of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury goods business.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to the hearing, but the call was later withdrawn after the press pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, together with the risk of "listing off" or can be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The tribunal shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is enough fine to eliminate most radio stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that when they shut up the media, they can do what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the newspaper Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and send us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been a target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to remove the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their fat salaries to about 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which are thus among the highest in the world.
They need to fight, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what interest
More and more Czechs are taking their money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in the spasms in the region.
The most money is spent on the side by Rakas, who save an average of 181 euros a month.
More than Czechs will save people in Slovakia.
This results from a survey of Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the cooks is improving, and two - thirds of those questioned plan to spend more money on the side.
While Czechs are in the middle of a carpenter's ladder, in Romania and Serbia people are still using very few products.
For example, almost every other Serbian according to the survey will save at home "under the pillow".
In the country this year, there have been an increase in the number of people who save monthly amounts.
Last month, thousands to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents were set aside for a variety of types of savings, and this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly contribution in the year-on-year comparison, however, declined slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit between savings products is pension insurance.
This favors 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to estimate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is declining, as did last year’s interest in investment funds.
You're only using 16 percent of the respondents, and last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what income they earn on individual products.
Above all, young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is engaged.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best knowledge of the returns of their money, with 73 percent of those questioned among people over 50 years of age.
In the international comparison of Erste Češi, they are leading the use of online banking, which 44% of people regularly use.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Raccoons with a 12 per cent distance.
UN celebrates new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is working immediately on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which started overnight in Rio de Janeiro, the Australian diplomats played a key role in the pursuit of "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that it is now time to "uplift over national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the objectives of sustainable development that the MDG is building on.
Concerns about the security of Mozambique are escalating due to a conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samara Machela, the founder’s president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo for a rare public demonstration to call peace slogans.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Out of fear for the future of her country, she exchanged her company's clothing for a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the T-shirt on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
After two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the party of Renamo were received, some of the worst conflicts since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, originally supported by the White Government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, he became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt in the country, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and local investors.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake because the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and coal bearings in the north-west can, over the next few years, bring investment worth more than $50 billion from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and the American Andarko.
The ruling side of Frelimo, the dominant political power since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
Renamo argues that the government has caused recent conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional garden of the Renamo Party on 17 September.
The violent attack of the former rebels culminated when government forces attacked the base of the party of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said to the Financial Times spokesman of the party of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing him of starting the conflicts of Renamo because he said he attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to ease his fear of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama had seen himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "everything that remained of his power to try to prove to the government that he could order his own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that the party to the 1992 peace agreement was withdrawn from Renamo.
The FT list said he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our aim is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have made it possible to ease the tension between these parties, blown up by a series of conflicts this year, just a little.
She is a nerd between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator, and neither one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The site of Renamo, which was seeking electoral change, has already said that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the shrinking movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
Since 1992, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the party of Renamo, has been declining since 1992 while the newer party, as expected, will improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – who ends his second term next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want more parties to the democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the party of Renamo has, but it has carried out vicious terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between the north and the south.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, the port on which mining companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to ask if Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good", Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent floods of abductions.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that it is for him to be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Protester Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life, ” says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that “the brute force cannot be equal to the cunning, ” while the artusian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myths would be “too wild and in some cases too outrageous for schooling,” said Crossley-Holland, who agrees for careful selection of works of age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been trading this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are among the seductive stories with the “sublime” message for children as a “turn off”.
Crossley-Holland, who from English translated epos Beowulf and who also writes Penguin Book and British National Bachelors, says: “You can have good intentions, but you can do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children needs a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
The Brno Starry will take visitors to space in the new digital industry
At first sight, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can climb into new comfortable seats and over their heads a projected area of 17 meters in diameter in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order to be perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered across the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno Starry Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of classical personal computers," noted starry technician Tomáš Hladík.
The digital industry can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The viewers will stare right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The starry management plans in the hall to project the purchased shows and their own creation.
There's two shows on the show since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about astronaut training, fly out into space, turn to centrifuge, and then see from thinking examples how challenging astronauts face the conditions of space.
The second show is for children and has the name Magic Utes - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose pestro - colored inhabitants lived a quiet life until the explosion of a nearby volcano.
The whole digitium cost about fifty million crowns, which the Ministry of Education paid mostly.
The city of Brno and the starry from its budget contributed in smaller amounts.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, projector twelve million.
"The rest was absorbed by audiovisual technology and computers," explained Dušek.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the starry facility passed two years ago.
According to Director Dusk, 25 to 30,000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We studied 11 THOUSAND INSTRUMENTS!
We know where they want you to go to work!
In November of last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 adverts offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 adverts (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
As early as 2005, when the survey took place for the first time, it accounted for 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it stood at around 60 per cent.
According to the analysis, the promotion of labour opportunities reflects to a large extent the current labour market situation.
An example may be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25 900 ads were published in the same monitored period, which was less than half in 2012.
The job offer on the Internet is focused on a narrower, particularly more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions including those of the workers, according to the author of the analysis of Pavlín Štětnová.
The degree of representation of selected professional groups varies between the two media.
On the Internet, the leading spots were ads looking for managers and managers, trade representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the other hand, large representations are mainly those of professional and professional professions.
Of course, the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertising are education.
Other areas monitored included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the demand for foreign language knowledge was expressed in three percent of ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In just two percent of ads, employers required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
'Computer literacy' claims appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of ads.
The requirements for practice are fully linked to qualified professions.
In particular, it is the production manager and other managers.
For workers' professions it is mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, supplemented by the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employers shall also specify in half of their advertisements the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most common skills required, communication skills have been emerging in the first place in advertising for a long time.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York was the birthplace of solo comedy performances in America: nearly a hundred years ago, a variety artist named Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the assembled people using the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the institution of solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to play in the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes a performance by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as a "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy performance in Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, so did the comedy world.
Several comics participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as the show in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll took off with his sitcom (a cheerfully spicy "League" on a fantastic FXX football theme) and now he has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", but the most famous was the rapidly spreading series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a lewd, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest drivers of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV Land show called Sit down Comedy with David Steinberg.
There's a meeting at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He said that when he's here, he walks down the alley between two buildings and he says, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
Oil prices further dropped to $96 per barrel
The price of oil on Friday continued to decline as concerns about high stocks were exported by the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-hunting manufacturing sector.
During the late morning, the American oil supply indicator dropped 14 cents per barrel in European electronic commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, 39 cents fell, and for the month of October, he was 5.8 percent behind.
The wealth of oil in the past few weeks has weighed the price.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two Chinese production reports prompted a higher demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to increase by 7.8 percent in the past two weak decades.
Oil Brent, an indicator for international oil also used by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Stock Exchange in London by 26 cents to $18.58 a barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Hasch.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
There must be such pressure that Martin Hasek is relieved of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so fragile.
Martin Hasek protects himself with the promise he made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politicians have (Mr Babiš has the material, but it is a question of whether they are politicians).
A better program promoted by a liar is unreliable.
In politics, he doesn't apologize. In politics, he gives up.
Mr. Hasch, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements say so to me, if you haven't really lied - here you see how complicated it is with lying), you will leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who has made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakness whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
You either want to be proud, be a missing person or be a life-long skeet.
You may find it unfair to address only you, but you're the leader and they're just the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to close your ears for a while, regroup your forces, sit this shame down and then attack again, but that's how partisans or scoundrels behave.
You, I repeat, are in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court blocked the regulation concerning the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial regulation requiring changes in the detention and search programme for persons at the New York Police Department and appealed the case against the judge.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until a decision of appeal was taken by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of people's stopping and questioning.
The city's conclusions and its correctional regulations were raised, including the decision to grant supervision to the police department to help change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the delay requested on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be dismissed because she had been in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge by not acting as a judge in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of the undertaking, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement that she had reacted openly to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unlawfully targeting blacks and Spaniards as part of their programme to stop and search people.
It has established independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and has ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test cameras carried on the body in certain areas where the most frequent stops are made.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the retention method and the address of the people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
Oral reasons for the city's appeal are scheduled sometimes after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
There has been some form of stopping and searching for persons for about a number of decades, but recorded inspections under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases it was blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, there were four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, a lawsuit that became a case of group action.
Supporters of the changes to the police department's detention and search programme claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police department and may influence how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents claim that change will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that it will lose money, but will not solve the wider problem when the police force is under pressure after the number of thousands of people has decreased in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not stopped the practice of stopping and searching persons who were constitutional, but had reformed the way in which the NYPD police department conducted the inspections.
Five shopping centers face low attendance
It comes from the real estate consulting companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Prague Bohnice is opening to the public The Kraków shopping center will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfying performance affects about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large centre towards locality and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, or possibly dead spots center," said Michal Sotak of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the retail property department, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi faces about a fifth of the shopping malls with low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport availability, low reception categories of local residents or market overcrowding in a given location.
Some of the projects opened up almost fully occupied, but their results were largely unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must try more to 'attract' their customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Sotak, the employment of shopping centres is generally stable, even with some centres it rises because the tenants were willing in the crisis to reduce the rent and accompany some units.
"It is true, however, that recently some projects have been opened which are not fully occupied and the average employment is thus reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc),” added Sotak.
The malls opened in the last two years are being marketed very slowly according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a building area for a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinition centres', aimed at buying and serving daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Sotak, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Sotak added.
In Prague he sees the space for the prepared shopping center on the Victory Square, and according to him they have the clear potential of the streets of Na Příkopa and Václavské plaza.
"Extensive expansion of retail parks that allow traders to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities at favourable rental and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, in particular their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of the business houses of Prior, which benefit from a good location," Dita Kubanková from DTZ added.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping centres with a total of over 2.2 million square meters of gross rentable areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic remains about 50 square meters per thousand population.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tip.
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of “breaking into the phone, watching and confrontation” to confirm the fraudulent tip on the love relationship that Charles Clarke, the then interior minister, was to be involved in.
State Attorney Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey trial said that the news of the world caught in May 2005 a false report that Clarke was seen with his “attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper assigned a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and infiltrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had called her and left her voicemails.
"The State representative suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the person who stands outside and hopes that people will get caught outside, but the person who likes to push people's stories to see what they say," Mr Edis said.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to study stories: hacking into the phone, watching, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about breaking into the phone?
He says no, we say: “But surely he knows. ”
The families about the love relationship that Clarke is involved with were first captured by the NotW News Department, when the sources that were sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You are wasting your time, she is with Charles."
The recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were identified as “Projects”.
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, the former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup were overseeing Mrs. Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message saying to her: “I got a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and that I would love to talk to Charles about. ”
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other important figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court Thursday, it was reported that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing the co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other people in order to hack into the phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherstaff admitted to hacking into the phone.
The disclosure of NSA increases social paranoia by the State
One day in peace, by the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing over the U.S. Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On instructions from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Home Reporting Agency, the aim of the mission was to obtain photos of the roof of the US forward patrol located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. National Intelligence Director, reiterated in September that the United States was not using its foreign reporting capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a co-worker, has begun to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, the European government and leading entrepreneurs, they no longer know if they have to trust the director's words.
Following reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying in Brazil's oil company and has gained access to the data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, there has been general paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone might have been tapped for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then the potential targets are also the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has seen intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden to date that the United States has transferred the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks some skills in the field of IT and the Internet, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
The German Parliament is calling for votes that we should produce a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and open them slowly again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to car and farmer.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical feasibility of American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is shocking for some companies that have so far believed that China’s biggest surveillance threat is still shocking.
There is a major shift in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have widely realized that the data stored in the US falls under the jurisdiction of the US and are therefore potentially offensive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance trading community, about 10 percent of non-American members have cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s general directors, says: “We have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German dignitaries argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is carried out is no surprise.
It's always been happening.
"It has been a major topic for many years, and it has not changed significantly even during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the Agrochemical Society BASF.
Americans are spying on us at business and industrial level, just like we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to brag about the measures they have taken to prevent, where appropriate, the advantage of the attacker.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive or leaving an unprotected notebook in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Automobile Board, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises employees to consider whether to not use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign routes because of the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then fired.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global market leaders in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France next to Russia and Israel in a second row of perpetrators who are involved in the hacking activity for economic rapporteurs, right behind China.
A member of the board of the German risk-free company concluded that in terms of economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal news agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: “Services know very well that all countries, even though they are working together to combat terrorism, are spying on their allies. ”
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe that he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a confused wrestling ghost in his high school gym, believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found creaked in a flat spiritual behind the stands at the gymnasium where he went on January 11.
Sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old youth refuses to do so.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They are convinced that it opposes logic, physical laws and common sense," said Crump.
They think it's to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag," he said.
State Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and he noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore announced at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts, wherever they take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for ordinary investigations," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of “suffocational suffocation. ”
According to Moore, however, the second autopsy indicated another cause of death.
"There are several questions which must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death for an order to investigate a crime or a violation of civil rights, he will ask the FBI and its execution.
The deputy sheriff's office in Lowndes County wasn't immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators were watching.
The parents of the youth hope that the videos will contain a clue leading to the discovery of how their son died.
CDC issued a directive on allergy in children for schools
In the centre of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a set of guidelines was issued to help in the event of child allergy to food at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies is rising.
One of the 20 kids in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The Directives provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about child allergy to food and how to react to allergic reactions, if any.
It also recommends that schools have adrenalin available – most often using an automatic EpiPen injector – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The national legislative authorities have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, “It’s like someone is fucking my tongue, ” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue, ” or “My tongue is itching. ”
Parents of intersexual children may choose “unspecified sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an ambiguous gender.
Newborn children will no longer be classed solely with male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex for such children, and it allows them to refer to their birth certificate as “unspecified” or “unspecified”.
The purpose of the law is to stop pushing parents to rush their child into surgery to determine sex, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person after many years said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'm going to be a slatan made by a doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 children, one is born, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (ovary or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to determine sex, it is better to use the best available information and determine it rather than wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said that the new German law “seems to be a good thing. ”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
Gender determination can be performed without surgery and can then wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how a child develops sexual responsibility is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-bound, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual structure, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female, or “third sex ” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first "unsexless" person in June when she won a court appeal so that she could retain the status of "unsexed" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have, in addition to M (man) and F (woman), a third designation, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a report in France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition for the removal of “sex theory ” from school textbooks.
The U.S. Catholic website also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn over two more pillars of civilization.”
A newborn mother in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see the children have sex at birth.
"Paternity itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said to the website on parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was kind of like a board that could be erased and crossed again.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation by saying that sex is a complex matter and that doctors can sometimes make wrong decisions because they do not know how children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to deal with children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is susceptible.
He created a new concept of “sexuality” and argued that the social causes and effects of the environment – how parents raised their child – affected children’s genes and hormones and created a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one instance in 1966, known as “John/John, ” his theory became controversial.
To the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged by miscircumcised circumcision, he recommended that their child be completely castrated, his testicles removed, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he had surgery back on the boy and married his wife.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors have been “using this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared “dissatisfaction with the result”.
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36 - year - old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex machine.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live “a satisfying life”.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the outer organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
He got female hormones when he was 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18 he was sent to a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop properly its sexual structure.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took a dose of testosterone, and had his chest removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice, based in California, fears that the German law “calls for sneezing and stigmatizing”.
"Many activists are afraid that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose “uncertain” for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll induce intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
It's a battle that a little child shouldn't be seduced at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a gender disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “entitle” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgens insensitive syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania in children's psychiatry.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space to not rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to take some tests and think about it and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have an amazing child, and you're looking forward to it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in the decision-making process and takes away the anxiety that the parents are having because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he identifies himself with more – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the authority to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension was rising, the fear was escalating.
The man threatened to set the whole house on fire.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslavi and a squad of voluntary firefighters, have therefore taken to the site.
A police negotiator who tried to excuse the man’s irrational behavior came to his place.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
That's how the attack unit must have entered the house, which destroyed the man and tied him up.
The aggressor then finished his examination at the juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic catch station.
The firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were rescued from the house.
He didn't put a man on a police negotiator, so he went to his command.
Message: Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton's candidate in 2012.
This discovery is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times magazine received a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president’s top associates had an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011 to assess whether the removal of Biden would help revive Obama’s pale hope of reelection.
According to the National Political Writer for Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head of the White House office Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the election by transferring the former Secretary of State of Clinton to the post of Vice President.
Potential change was a highly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisors — including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign, Jim Messina, and former chief advisors in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “Objam's chances would not significantly increase”.
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering the replacement of Biden Clinton.
“I have studied a number of things intensively, and this was one of them,” said Daley.
You should not forget that the president had terrible prospects at that time, so we said, “Christ, what are we supposed to do? ”
While Daley described research as “the proper care, ” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to see if this move would pay off in the elections.
"The campaigns do not spend such money on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered," Martin said at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential card mix-up.
While Daley said that he did not think that the president was “aware of the potential change, ” the former head of the office admitted that it was“ possible ” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double down” definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on Biden's runoff.
“Perhaps,” said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
The British entrepreneur produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a glowing pammel.
He came up with the idea when he read a medical discussion on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – increases the pH level in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lick, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: “It’s an amazing substance, but as far as production is concerned, we’re at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you’ll get about 2 g of this substance.”
The protein used in ice cream reacts with your tongue in neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH increases and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish glowing is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unusual flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold tickets.
His next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says: “I would really like to make an invisible ice cream. ”
Basically, it's impossible because of the break in the light of the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I'm counting on us to find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up for a long time and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a caregiver.
After two years, my apartment didn't show up for sugar, and this year probably won't be any different.
But statistics show I'm a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year, Halloween will be celebrated by most Americans — in fact 158 million of them — and will spend $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, 1.2 billion is expected to go into costumes.
This year they're the last shot of the fashion of sexy, non-living objects.
Sex doesn't just have to be women anymore; sex can also be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies through the dead parade, and I bet the Daft Punk Spacemen will be able to get to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we put our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $330 million on animal pet costumes this year.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not wasting time.
According to Nielsen, Americans are going to lose $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark sticks.
This is an amazing report for 41 million Christmases who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we're going to buy, and believe me, we're going to consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Sugar Association, almost 16,000 tonnes will be sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never broken.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than creepy houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1,200 haunted houses in the United States, which, according to the American Scary Houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes the amazing photos that you're scared of and that your friend will give you on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will look at the picture and post a comment as "you're looking good."
And in the end, there's not much about pumpkins.
When we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us to a great pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and cutting a pumpkin lantern is kind of like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “baby in pumpkins” started with Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. census office, Americans are spending about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you are looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut their pumpkins weighing almost one tonne.
A series of Land Rovers announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
There are improved brakes, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of the Bowler Motorsport, said: “The players in the Bowler races have changed. ”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an attainable way to world class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this path in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defendor Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In February, the Defender Challenge will offer a school day and a test day as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have early elections
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election.
A week after the last interview for Aktuálna.cz said that there is no other way out and every government has voted last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, with the life expectancy of the beginning election period estimated within two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a slightly more balanced decision."
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not allow his side to lose voters as it did this year in other elections (roughly 300,000 votes lost in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that early elections would be held, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in the Czech Republic, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party's leadership, announced that either he or Michal Hasek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"The leaders of the democratic party as little boys follow the head of the state to enable them to turn aside."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so foolishly done in my life," added President TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (who he faced in the struggle for presidential office) he shook: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to empower the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first drafts of laws in Parliament, including the Farsi Treaty Register, which before the elections discussed parliamentary committees but with early elections fell under the table.
The president of TOP 09 in the interview for the Current.cz argues that such speed is given by "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the election leader of the ANO Martin Komárek movement accused TOP 09 in the electoral battle of the idea of establishing a register of contracts "stolen" the ANO movement programme.
TOP 09 has now taken the lead - just dusted the proposal, which has been stepped into the second reading.
Fire Departments have come to rescue a lost puppy who's been trapped 15 metres above ground on a dangerous ground in a quarry.
Corkspaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man who had been imprisoned in a quarry saw him.
Firefighters were salting on the rock wall to save the dog from certain deaths.
Puppies were liberated by fire squads who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous ground in a 15 - foot [15 m] quarry above ground.
Ruby's nine-month-old cockerel escaped after a small car accident Sunday afternoon, and he survived for three days on Wednesday until he was exonerated from the quarry.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and their friend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, feverishly after his lost dog, they searched and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 2:15 p.m., a bright - looking poet caught Ruby on a rock - mass project 15 meters above the ground.
In place, he rushed a technical rescue team from the Clackheaton fire station and went down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up on a rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrows during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got some cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team’s expert commander, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby’s luck was great during his escape. ”
There was a possibility that he would be badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and besides exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “When I looked at the rescue action, I was afraid. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in your arms again.
The vet said if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there. ”
Firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he definitely didn't leave after 18 years of age, Katy Perry.
During an interview for the Australian radio show this week, this pop star said that for Jagger’s song “Old Habitats Die Hard” from 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she said, “That was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me.”
In a statement from Thursday's Jagger (70), the representative said he categorically refused to make Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said: “Maybe he is confusing him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the host singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerevan: Split Europe Gives Scots Choices
Next day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that his entry into Schengen would be a condition for independent Scotland's membership in the EU.
This led to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's wave.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this was not reflected in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they are satisfied.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen right now, an offer of continued disagreement would be a cheap concession for Brussels for whatever the Scots really want.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And in addition, so old that he became a digger, a news duck that “independence means passport control, ” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting thought in this bearded story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade London homing for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: a great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Across Europe, the parties are influenced by dedicated opposition to the EU or by the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of the Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came out of nowhere and has already used almost five million votes in the September federal elections, making the Bundestag essentially the "screw" of the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
There has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the national economy-increased index, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates favourable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to reduce revenue and public expenditure – which Germany is encouraging.
With current budget and currency problems, there is a deeper cause of European underperformance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies for consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it is for the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not even any freeze on wages in the world would prevent Europe's petrochemical industry from being trampled on by cheap U.S. shale oil.
The result is a pervasive mutiny, especially in France, once enthusiastic EU supporters.
After the war, political elites in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany at bay and allow Paris to stand up in the world at Washington level.
But Paris no longer needs and imposes its own economic policy in Europe as a proof of political legitimacy, and has left its fate to the worn-out French economy.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Penová, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for British Labour that they cannot assume that the cutting of the right will automatically be positive on the left.
How does Le Penn handle its newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc can dominate the European Parliament for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
At the same time, I think that the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will be lost in due course.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be transformed into something more free in the sense of "Europe (the sovereign) nations", already favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of telling Berlin and Brussels when to leave us.
I assume that Scotland would do well in the relaxed arrangements of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries would be easier in a non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The government of SNP in Scotland is, surprisingly, the most successful political movement not pursuing austerity measures in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011, thanks to opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now elected independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Adults
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics achieve puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is approaching
It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts say one of the triggers of earlier puberty can be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so obvious in boys.
The former CNN rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family problems.
Should the mother be frightened when her daughter starts to grow breasts and hair on the shame of 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplovitz, explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure that it was not usually a sign of rapid growth towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair and armpits and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the past 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age of the first period.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When the breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first period,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book ‘Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem’.
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before 8 years of age, the girl is considered “advanced”.
In most cases the process will slow down or stop – which can be carefully monitored by children’s doctors.
Rapid growth may be the reason why endocrinologist tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which may eventually lead to an end to growth and maturation in adulthood.
Recommendations on medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the child’s age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
With regard to drug use, Kaplovitz is cautious, but admits that “the suppression of puberty can alleviate problems with the behavior of a girl and her feelings that she is different from her peers. ”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods.
"They are worried they can get pregnant, or how they can manage hygiene," Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter began to have a period of 10 years.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation together, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a related set of evidence that hormones are at fault in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – achieve puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz insists that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001 he helped with a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which links body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Spaniards tend to achieve puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already under the age of hair loss in the face and in shame, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Child Doctors (AAP) conference added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and pubic shame is common even in infants and backpacks.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual arrival of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb children’s hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child before you know it," Kaplovitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will likely react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be assured that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadja Konvalinka as a housewife.
Does he have a new job?
Nadja Konvalinková, 62, appeared behind the barrage as a housewife, and she was doing a lot of good.
That a popular Czech actress would plan a change of profession and be able to do business at the pub?
Nadia Convalinka showed up at the James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even my boss offered to hire me, and I could eat my beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I am doing today, in acting," said Konvalink, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," the actress said.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový, also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I can't drink in my present new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to do," the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers wish for the width of seats, large orders are at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a dispute over the spread of second-class seats in long-distance flights, which this month caused a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-distance flights for the economic class – not the one normally preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but America's main rival Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is spread out – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to it – is the basis of economic performance rights on the design of the new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says that the improved model “777X” will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm distributed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its model A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Huge aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through commercials in professional media.
Airbus is now ahead of the Dubai air show, where it is expected that 777X will gain an advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture of three people who were sealed in a restaurant with the title “Would You Like It? ”
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in smaller seats than in regional turbo-duty aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are bigger, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health, the average American weight has increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a 100 cm belt.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s when the average width of seats of newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has done research that suggests that the expansion of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the dimensions of Airbus seats and says that it is not within the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It is really about giving flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do things they believe they must do to make them successful," said a cabin expert at Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what their profits are.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, greater space is essential for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to avoid the American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, seat distribution is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 per cent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance claims of Boeing depend in part on the comparison of the design of the 777X model with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profits in unit costs are weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to instill more seats, and make his planes more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, who is responsible for the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are consistent that many passengers are for a denser distribution that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
“A four-inch wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the entrepreneurial point of view of Airbus the proposal is motivated by the threat of model 777,” said an expert on the interior of Mary Kirby’s cabin, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers so that they can choose.
Traveling aircraft salesmen even carry a measuring band to check the competitive arrangements.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high-density arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more cabin adjustment by offering larger seats in alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can discourage the 777X sales wave.
The number of HIV-infected people in Prague exceeded the thousands of dollars
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121 and in 2010 it was 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients arrived in the country from January to September last year, with 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, the most infected being in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Central Bohemian region, there were 206 people infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian Silesia or 116 from Ustec.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, since the beginning of the testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century, this case has not appeared in the Czech Republic.
With HIV, six children were also born, and they were transferred from their mother.
Nonsense in the film Gravity is, but it's beautiful, according to experts.
The fantastic film from the Universe of Gravity sold cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after the premiere.
In October, nearly 150,000 viewers saw it according to the Union and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews value the picture positively.
Others, however, find certain irregularities in it.
The server Lidovka.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetarium Brno): I like science-fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dream stories.
Gravitation is no exception, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I've enjoyed it too much.
You can see, for example, the hairs of Sandy Bullock, which are somehow not lifted in a state of difficulty.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving along vastly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some movie viewers blame the unreal effect and even the whole behavior of fire in a state of difficulty.
They don't think the suits can take that kind of wound either.
Heroes in Gravity often get into conflict with different objects and suits without any more trouble.
The criticism was not spared, nor was the plot of history.
Such an extensive tragedy on Earth's orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People are also arguing in forums about the "imreal" behavior of lan.
She looks like she was destined for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide canvas, but I can tell you clearly, I have been enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction.
And in such a story the author has the right (almost obliged) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than you mentioned, I was touched by the three times shown space stations with degrading levels of technology (latest Chinese)."
"Chinese won't be until the end of the decade and it'll probably look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate physical laws, and so the natural-oriented viewer will appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of motion is quite right, as the dictionary of physics says, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic including the thin pillar of the atmosphere and the polar glow shining in the polar regions.
Irregularities will certainly be found in more detailed examinations.
In addition, when I read the comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris on orbits appears to be reversed in some scenes rather than should actually be (west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and in heaven-calling errors against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus it is evident that the creators have made a difference in the authenticity of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubbl's space telescope is orbiting differently from the ISS.
As a result, there is a wide variety of speeds and rescue operations could therefore not actually take place as shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) Department, I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear source of power acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to engage at a time when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine can take pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
The only dose of vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life against nicotine addiction.
Before human trials, it is necessary to perform further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first clues are good.
"We certainly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the formation of anti-nicotic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which will then start creating a smooth current of these antibodies.
Antibodies hunt down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get to the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine attack.
In the tests of the vaccinated mouse, which was added to nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that have not been vaccinated “relaxed, ” said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine has entered their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as it converts liver cells into factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for people, they could be given to children before they had the desire to try a cigarette, thus preventing addiction to nicotine.
Much more likely, however, it would be used by smokers to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they will not enjoy it, and it will help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but point out that further research is needed.
Tripods deny Obeid's influence.
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for the Supervision of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on a controlled land government.
On Friday, the Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its search to see if Mr Obeid had lobbyed with several state ministers to rent him a rental at Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a cafe, resumed without having to take part in the tender procedure after his expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's hidden interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted Thursday by Mr Tripoli's former representative, Lynn Ashpole.
During the years of interviews launched in 2005, the government pressured them to rent public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for enterprises in Circular Quay, which brought Obeidov $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as the Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a proponent of public competition.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
A copy of the calls submitted in IAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodim and Mr Steve Dunn, the head official who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic of the interviews during these telephone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" said Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely, Mr Tripoli.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, said the responsible officer
Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port of Lázikija on Thursday night, the responsible officer of the Fox News administrative station confirmed.
This responsible factor specifically did not say what the goal was, but said that he was at least one.
Press agency Associated Press reports that the target was SA-125 Russian rockets.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an air strike on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, commentator Pečina spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree, while Chairman Štěch was stirring up a dispute.
Haytman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of this misery ČSSD continues.
The other gentlemen presented their weaknesses in particular.
Senator Dienstbier is fundamental and legible and impregnable, Vice-President Zaoralek has made it impossible to talk on TV the most.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the CzechSSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate Gajdošková, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would lead to standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in charge can barely support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and to continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdošková could draw up a minority government with a simple blessing from President Babish and without the people, but with the human health minister Speech, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability, as it would have enforced a proper referendum law and committed itself to supporting the President of the Okamura Dawn.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progress of the tax, for he is bright and will see that it is not possible without it.
People wouldn't bring problems because the talk is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to YES, and a valuable minister would be found here too, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into a risky government participation, they will provide support, also well.

Foreign visa-licensed workers may undergo a ‘legislative’ test
With the Government's intention to extend police action, it is considering the "authority" test for foreign visa-licensed workers 457.
The test, if adopted, will be carried out by means of criteria in order to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government rhetoric on foreign workers with the words that this could offend Australian neighbours.
“The public declaration “foreigners at the end of the front” and “work first for the Australians” is a very unpleasant remainder of the time when the unions demanded a protected labour market”, the Australian-Indian Institute said today.
Historically, it meant that the white labour force should be protected – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region recorded the sound of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was dealing with officials for human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remain to be considered.
Where the ‘authority’ criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or the relevant person sponsoring the undertaking’.
Following previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed by hundreds, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who sought asylum died suspected of having a heart attack after arriving on a ship of asylum on Christmas Island this week.
A man’s nine - year - old son traveled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat after his father’s death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities and their husband rushed to the hospital on the Christmas islands where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the railway project HS2 for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
When phase two is completed, it will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the Transport Scotland National Transportation Office, entrusted HS2 with the task of finding further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better connect Great Britain and its cities. ”
We gave SH2 green because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about connecting – across the United Kingdom, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "clearly" support Scotland's integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high - speed track has the potential to bring untold economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight in the overall case of high - speed rail across Britain. ”
So we are delighted to work with the British government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing to everyone the benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
The inspection and analysis of the anti-corruption police have been arrested jointly with Barta
Information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday night when the report was brought by the server Prvozprady.cz.
MF DNES has since found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of the Security Corps (GIBS), its people were to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection solves cases where there are accused police officers, but its competence also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - head of analysts and informatics Jan Petržilek - is among the arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, the anti-corruption police spokeswoman Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information with the exception that the media must turn to Gibbs in this matter.
Even her spokeswoman, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything about the case, referred in reverse to the City Attorney's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of the hidden facts," said the spokesman for the representative of Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be said from this non-specific reaction that the event took place, but is in a regime of secrecy that the speaker does not allow to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer, Oldrich Poor.
The media said that Bart is representing "even in this matter," but given that it's classified information, Bart's arrest can't confirm or reverse.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest might have something to do with former police President Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Bart along with former VV Chairman Radek John, who was at the head of the interior ministry.
The dispute that had fueled the dispute between the expert Peter Nečas and VV even had to be settled by then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection to my person came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said idNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially pushed by Radek John, the real head of the party, but he was then Bart.
Barta now ran for the election for the dawn movement, the parliamentary mandate escaped him only closely - by 175 votes.
The leader of Christmas, Tomio Okamura, has declared that he has no idea what this is all about.
"Barta was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Christmas of the direct democracy of Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who before the elections said that he had given Bart space to run for Christmas because he had helped him solve the problem of executors.
Vít Barta ended up in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škarka.
The rules on the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft shall remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to switch off their tablets and smartphones during the launch and landing period, regardless of changes in the US to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given US companies space to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the equipment remains in flight mode.
Passengers can already do this during the majority part of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires US carriers to do a great deal of work in order to meet these requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA does not currently have any specific provisions governing the use of electronic equipment on board the aircraft,’ he said.
This issue is covered by provisions requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the entire period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who had already talked to Casa about expanding the use of its wi-fi on-board entertainment system, was favoured but announced that the regulatory authority would be subject to the decision.
"We would like to see the CASA analyse the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment) it would improve the experience of customers," the speaker said.
Qantas announced that for the time being, it would adhere to current regulations.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that may be useful for our passengers, and we are certainly thoroughly studying the FAA decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from that of the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference with mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, manual luggage programmes and information for passengers.
“As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleets, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall order passengers to shut down during landing of the equipment.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage area above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
Janani Amirthalinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings stop at Bendemeer's shopping mall in Singapore so she can pay her daughter her tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I gave up all my money for it,” says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 every month as an administrator (3,000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman is performing her transaction, has become the third stallion on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Stoppers in Singapore usually apply an annual percentage of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, stop-ups have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or a receipt document, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
As a result, as families feel pressured by the increasing cost of living and the growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a free monetary policy in advanced economies, low and medium-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted an increasing use of credit in households mainly because of rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt due to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the head of a ladder with a ratio of 80 per cent of GDP, which is an increase compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which had just come out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and decreased consumer demand.
"It is essential that the rising costs of people from medium to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high prices of gold over the past two years have contributed to people’s adhering to stopping their personal belongings and taking advantage of the opportunity to change the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items in 200 urban pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we get it back next month.
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
The growth in the pawnshop sector is so great that ValueMax, a branch manager in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD it received this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors found themselves under fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Mrs Yeah says that the mortgage offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Contractors stop items that they already own, and the cashing of personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In society, the acquisition of property is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Besides, those who use pawnshops are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when stopping gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all kinds.
"There are rich individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their courageous business or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow," Mrs Yes says.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for shrinking health care in Tasmania contains strict conditions to ensure that the government does not spend money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking “accelerated measures” to address the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
For four years, funding was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems it faces," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey ops, will help to remove debt.
Money is also available at clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-op care, health specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that the leading clinic doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian medical system," Mrs Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Australian Union's money and report monthly on where additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not be worth anything “until real reform follows in order to lay a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system”.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for its response to its request for speedy assistance, which he first raised in talks with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can relieve public health from a critical state," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the Government, these additional selected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Speaking federal opposition in the field of health care, Peter Dutton believes today's statement is just a "skin".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour government has removed $430 million from our health system," ABC TV said.
You can't have a government that's going to take nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that's going to spend $300 million, and it's going to look like it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued for higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoloux has adapted the Denise Dideroto novel, which brings an exceptional film expedition and the creation of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he rebels, he experiences extreme cruel treatment from a criminally depraved mother introduced, and for another he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The movie never slides to greed or sensation, and that's his problem.
The ritual aspect of this story leads viewers to experience the pain of wearing a worn shirt.

Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, the Committee on Global Control of Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the places where toxic substances were supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the date by which that organisation, based in The Hague, established Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and chemical mixing equipment for the purpose of producing nuclear gas and discharging ammunition.
The completion of this in principle the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hypertight and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting raged in the town of Safira, which experts refer to as the home of the chemical weapons and storage plant, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with its headquarters in Britain reported on Thursday.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Assad, 18,678 government fighters and 187 armed men from Lebanon's Hizballah.
Among those killed are 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom are connected to Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but she did not have specific numbers.
The fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in the midst of the ongoing civil war in Syria, have to deal with the tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW Office, which is working closely with the UN, it was said that its team is now "satisfying that it has verified and monitored the destruction of Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that the two sites, according to Syria, "were abandoned and ... the chemical weapons programme items contained were moved to two other designated sites which were checked".
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of the places the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed on a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I bow to the courage and courage that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organisation has ever had," said the Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumac in his comment issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government stand against each other in the civil war with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alavit sect, from the Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of the Observatory, Ramí Abdul Rahman, said that there had been a massive explosion on Wednesday inside the air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikija.
He said the cause of the explosion wasn't known.
Anger at the verdict handed down against the founder of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded in anger to the verdict handed down against the last of the founders who were facing justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for building the explosive device used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder during an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, even though it may have insisted that a man named “Demotion man” (a bullfighter) would be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: “It should be built in front of the execution squad.”
Every day I have to live with not seeing my grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sarai Club was compared to the country when a heavy load was launched shortly after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 in an outdoor parked van.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber fired a bag full of explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while kept alive, three times the doctors “died. ”
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell, Jamá Islamija, responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, he just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others isn't that bad.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the assassins in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011 he was eventually caught in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later American forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that news reports revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not give up voluntarily," said Mrs Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for how much he has caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological advances on aircraft (but may not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – except for calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the eagerly expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers, however, should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, the manager of the FAA Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the plant storage directive in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Despite the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of three kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their equipment once the aircraft has fallen to land and will not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and take-off, according to the FAA.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to allow passengers to use WiFi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the change.
"As soon as the new rules are put in place safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “guards. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, e-mailing and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometres of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no words with friends, online game of type scrabble played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when, as is well known, he was thrown off American Airlines' plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And more difficult devices like laptops will have to be kept for fear that they might hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, a national safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference in the air with the towers," Rosenker said.
In order to examine this problem, the FAA Scientific Advisory Committee last month proposed that the government allow the wider use of electronic equipment.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a democracyist from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is widespread.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget the obligation to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, technical output of the time.
New airlines are much more susceptible to electrical systems than previous-generation aircraft, but are also designed, and approved by FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at altitudes.
Plans designed for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt under the new rules for greater use of electronic equipment, Huert said.
Modern electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio transmission than they did in previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue a minimum transmission when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or transmit data.
Among those who press to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and carried out test flights, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said he believed that the disruption from these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee stated that there are only succinct reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption of aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their equipment during flight by low visibility devices.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes and it considers that it is a reasonable procedure for the passenger public, which technology uses to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the Black Sea oil rig, and released back to the wild.
One shrub was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA in the rescue centre until it recovered.
Colin Seddon, the operating center, said: “This cartilage probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found shelter on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help. ”
At the time the cartilage was released, he was in good condition and in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to connect businesses and to define what changes in relation to the EU British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we have set out the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be for many surprises.
We have found that the crushing majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are staging.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than become part of a long and strenuous process of reforming secret European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas – from monopolistic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European society, expressed their consent.
Finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most eloquent knowledge, and although the clear majority want Britain to seek to change the treaty and relations with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings with which companies of different sizes and major business groups have identified themselves indicate that the business sector is pushing for “a meaningful change” that will have an impact back on Britain.
There is much at stake – achieving a change in the contract and a better agreement for Britain can mean up to 16% profit in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the conditions of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to represent a significant shift from the current balancing of forces back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and as the euro area travels towards a narrower economic and fiscal union, it is increasingly necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach to business.
John Kerry confessed: spying has gone too far!
The United States has gone "too far" in spying sometimes, admitting according to the AFP the head of US diplomacy John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
But according to the minister, the gathering of information has served to deter terrorist attacks.
"First confession from Washington" according to AFP sounded in the middle of a heated controversy on both shores of the Atlantic over a scandalous discovery of mass data tracking by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has also been targeted by American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he primarily defended previous practice.
He believes that the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the assassinations of Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from going off and people were killed because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone disproportionately far".
The affair surrounding American intelligence, which reportedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans were watching Angela Merkel's German Chancellor's cell phone.
European leaders did not hide resentment and some of them called on the European Union to try and reach an agreement with the United States that would either prevent or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom director.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct links to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
Once the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a cheap price.
Gazprom says that the construction is expected to start at the end of this year in other countries.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hizbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese movement Hizbollah deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle on the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to increasingly accurate reports, Israel destroyed rockets intended for Hizbollah during the central raids in two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but it has clearly said that it will prevent the movement of weapons to the hands of Hizbollah to Lebanon.
Reports of central Israeli attacks on weapons warehouses in western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment, but was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region of the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The Al-Arabiya reporting station claims that two warehouses were hit, where the missiles were ready for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was rockets of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Yishai said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with missiles and Syrian aviation is teaching members of the armed section of Hizballah to deal with missiles.
SA-8 are obsolete rockets that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They're placed on a moving chassis.
Although relatively primitive, mobility and small dimensions make it easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after firing the shot, so it's hard to spot.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling alavits.
This is a well-guarded area, and Hizbollah has been involved in the fights in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, which the alavites belong to.
It is now believed that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamoon.
Along with Hizbollah there, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the country of Homs.
According to al-Arabii's source, the battle is to be a retaliation for a recent attack by the opposition against the Syrian Shiite brigade's commander, Abu Fadla Abbas, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army fight back the town of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusairu have just gone to Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wished for early elections.
Corruption, money laundering for overpriced purchases and public procurement, tax hikes and, last but not least, government scandals have been cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that most citizens were satisfied with the situation.
That they didn't really mind, and with the state that was here (the looting and borrowing of this state) they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not vote, 596,357 electors elected TOP 09,384,174 voters elected the ODS in total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all eligible voters.
Which is half the majority.
When I add 1,016 829 ČSSD voters to the above mentioned parties, then the old order (because all of the parties involved in the "stealing" and the indebtedness of this state) was actually accepted by 64.23% of eligible voters.
In fact, most voters have indicated that they are not for the purpose of punishing the perpetrators of the looting and pre-debt of that state.
Or do you think that the members of the Czech Federation who participated in this would be in charge of appropriate laws?
Is there anything we can do?

The Royal Commission learned that two members of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) had been charged before the charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children before being charged with child custody by Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the Commission, it was said that in its initial statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with a child’s sexual abuse in their organization.
The Executive Director of Phillip Hare was asked about the case where one of the employees of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and another when a trainer in Caringbah from YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment of children who had been in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the board advisor, that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
He admitted that the initial statement by YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which valued the organisation as the leading advocate of children's rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission shows that YMCA was reminded that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Company in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who began working with YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that the leadership from him himself failed when Mr. Lord was accepted without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys who were admitted in two years when he worked at the YMCA Association.
He's been trapped for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, denied the claim that YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting child safety violations by Mr. Lord.
The staff gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, kept them private, kept them sitting on his lap, told them that he liked them, and kept them playing with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord’s subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the YMCA Children’s Association in Caringbah, who was Lord’s supervisor, was “very frightening and often difficult to talk to him about. ”
The Director-General said he did not accept the evidence of the staff that they felt unaware if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had darkened their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the Board of the YMCA in New South Wales felt that the lesson from “the case of Jonathan Lord ” for the organization was that the staff “did not report any news, ” and the advice agreed with him.
Mr Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign agreements on the preservation of silence shortly after the indictment had emerged was made by the general manager for child services in YMCA by Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid tampering with evidence, but it was “excessively zealous ” and mismanaged.
A child sexual abuse expert, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, told the Commission that YMCA was not a safe organization in New South Wales between 2009 and 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, working, training, and managing staff.
The hearing was adjourned on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but he admitted that coming back is unlikely.
On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he has resigned from his post of leadership, Mr Blair has largely avoided talks on British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his reply to the London newspaper Evening Standard read: “Yes, of course, but it will be difficult to find that, so...”
While Cardiff was gathering experts to perform horses to fight for the price of Horse of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet going to school and only a few months ago he made the first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, flattened three rounds to finally win the main prize and left behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by Sunnybank Riding Centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in the elegant hats, shoved his beret into a cheerful corner and let his two-year-old Toffee march around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control a horse that far exceeds his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for appearance and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March and has been practicing with this Shetland pony since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are very cooperative. ”
They didn't have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he and Toffe competed, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been playing horses for more than 10 years.
“ There was an exciting atmosphere, ” says Mrs. Howells, “and everyone cheered and applauded. ”
He ran across the sand all over the arena, and although he acted so finely, he gave excellent performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and he has two chickens in charge.
Since he started, he'll be back soon at the Horse of the Year competition, and I'm sure he'll do just fine.
The speaker of the annual horse show said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony. ”
They make a great team together.
The jury picked Fenton and Toffee up for their excellent speech and for the way they presented themselves for the competition.
They always watch how good the team work is between the pony and the one who runs it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the lovely clothes he really fit in with him.
Too many curious newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which requested the release of a reporter accused of conspiracies on the front page, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
New Express newspaper based in Guangzhou made a rare public application for the release of Chen Yongzhou.
Later, however, Mr. Chen admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a society partly owned by the state.
The warden said that the New Express newspaper would now perform a "full correction".
The regulation for "correction" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and TV in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 New Express from the Yangcheng Group Evening News published several false reports about the company Zoomlion.
"The New Express newspaper management was unorganized," the warden said in his statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of lifting a journalistic license”.
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Group Evening News to carry out the overall correction of New Express and recommended that they examine the relevant persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express. ”
Mr Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper issued two applications for his release on the front page and claimed that it was worth his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen showed up on state television and confessed to publishing false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," CCTV State Reporting Station said.
I did it mainly because I was fond of money and fame.
I realize I did the wrong thing.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued an apology on the front page stating that he failed when he failed to check his reports adequately.
Recently, a number of heavily watched suspects were confessed on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly forced, regardless of the change in the law of this year, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame himself.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail, has been successful.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel of about one meter in dimensions as one of the most ingenious secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks into the length of nearly six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities stated that the tunnel was closed before drugs could be smuggled in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers enter vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which poses a problem to drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor about 650 metres long equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre connect management.
For example, they will offer a joint advertising
The new integrated newsroom of the company Economia in Prague's Karlín.
Economia has taken another step to transform the holding centre into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economics and Centre has shared top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the staff union are essential for the integration of the two publishers into the joint media house," commented the vice-president of the Economie Board and the Commissioner-General Kamil Čermák.
Cermak, who will lead the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new Joint Director of Trade was appointed Pavel Váparíl, also under the authority of the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová.
Stephen Burda became the new head of information technology.
Vladimír Piskaček is the joint director of the editorial board, whose team is also the director of the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was appointed director of marketing.
A separate department of corporate communication is newly managed by the Lhotská Faith.
The Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will enable us, inter alia, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the production of the content of all titles issued and, last but not least, to significantly improve the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a contract to purchase the company Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálno.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the signs Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Definitely or portfolio of other almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is a publisher of Economic Newspapers, IHNED.cz news server, Weeks of Respect and Economy and the number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers is the most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles in the long term.
This June, the publishing industry moved to a newly built modern space in Karlín, Prague.
CME will target the TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to cut thousands of people.
The section intends all the side activities and wants to focus only on its main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
It's almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds a license for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smichov, Telka and Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will be affected by the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the local TV unit TV Nova, it is not clear yet.
"This is premature and we really can't comment," said communication director Nova Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personnel status of the CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new chiefs of New Christoph Mainush and Michael Del Nin, who followed longtime director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a central conference call with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own shows, filmmaking and production activities.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, the coolant tower burned in the night
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, there was a large capacity storage unit, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"Fire was fired by firefighters on Thursday evening 11 o'clock, fire was put out this morning," Pavlín Adamcová, the spokesman for the Prague firefighters, announced.
The amount of damage in the air in the vicinity according to the measurement did not exceed the limits allowed.
The amount of damage and cause of the fire is still unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kohlbenov Street.
"It is a fire of a large-capacity container, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we use the transport lines from the tanks," she added.
According to the server, tn.cz complicated the shutdown of a malfunctioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire commander has declared the second degree of fire alarm.
There are four of them, and in the most serious situations, the fourth is declared.
They also went to the site to check the amount of dangerous substances that could have gone into the air during the fire.
"But they did not find in the air the amount of damage that would exceed the hygiene standards," the firefighters said.
British police have delivered a release notice to Assange
The British police today delivered a notice of release to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard announced that he had delivered a “issue notice” to 40 - year - old Australian by asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange, under British law, has exhausted his options when this month the Supreme Court annulled his appeal against the issue, thus facing a release to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th, where he requested asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard “advised a notice of release to a 40 - year - old man requesting to arrive at the police station on the day and hour that he was assigned, ” the speaker said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of bail.
The Embassy refused to send a notice of issuance to comment.
Assange is afraid that he will be issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face the charges of espionage because he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver got a fine of £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist got a fine of £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found out he had a cup of drinks between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to the accusation that he was driving recklessly and carelessly.
Seven points came into his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of £90 and a contribution to the accused £100.
As a result of the tax on owners of foreign real estates, the London Bubble of Prague
The Ministry of Finance has pre-calculated the income tax on financial assets, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr Osborn, who presented in the 2012 budget a fee of 7 % for the transfer of real estate for buildings in the price of over 2 million pounds and an annual fee for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the transfer fee in the Housing Fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, is already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “With the increase in the transfer of property to high value homes and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that property of high value is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system. ”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to hesitate to buy property in London, or that existing owners would hesitate to sell. ”
The front real estate – top 5% to 10% of the housing market at a price – in a rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon recorded an increase of 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5,6 % year after year, but were overshadowed by a thriving ‘home market’ where, according to a survey, Savills’ real estate offices experienced a south-west, north (7,4 %) and east (6,5 %) of the increase.
Scientists have explained more how tail movements are related to the dog’s mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs spin their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs tend to have tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these fine differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well - known to have a different relationship between the left and the right sides of the brain and the incentives that arouse positive or negative emotions. ”
The same was true of other species.
He added that, as with humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate rotation of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long to figure out why their tails sometimes go one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dogs films about dogs – either in the natural version or in the form of silhouette – in order to get rid of any mating impulses, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and represent it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw an otherwise indistinguishable dog moving his tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog rotating his tail), she remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the filming of her tail mostly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view spinning her tail), their heart rate increased and the animals appeared uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think that dogs would communicate knowingly through these movements.
Rather, it believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and who do not need to be alert.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly linked to friendly behavior and the movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience. ”
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
A dog behavior expert, John Bradshaw, a university teacher of animal medicine at Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side of the dog were important.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog, and to the right when they were looking at a happy dog.
And in another professional discussion from Victoria University, Canada, he said: “The dog’s robot with dogs was more likely to be introduced when he was turning left tail than right, when they were more uncertain — on the contrary, the Italian study. ”
According to him, the difference may be given by the fact that dogs in these different animal studies in films or dog robots did not completely interpret themselves as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although there is good evidence for many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't take long to understand why their tails sometimes go one way or the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved the concert to Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock band moved the concert to Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with an inflammation of the larynx.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to go out on Friday at the city complex Hydro.
But chief singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone the Thursday performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys group must postpone the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1. ”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with sore throat and unfortunately he won't be able to get out."
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21st.
All tickets for these performances shall remain valid.

Pope Frantisek appoints the first cardinal in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis on February 22nd had first appointed the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope, and they are the ones who choose the pope, so Frantisek will establish his first group of men who will eventually help to select his successors.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he is no longer able to participate in the election of the pope – the group is thus reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement notifying this report, the Peter Federico Lombardi, the spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of current cardinals known as the Consistoria would take place before the festivities of the new cardinals.
"Dad František has decided to announce his decision to call the February consortium in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes for the number of voters to rise again to 120, and as many cardinals as he wants over 80 years of age.
The consortium will be important next year because it will be the first time Frantisek was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is some focus on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since František appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope has decided everything for himself.
"Now František has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that “it is quite possible ” that these cardinals the pope would ask for counsel.
But we have not been in this situation before – it is a complete novelty.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted the cardinals of the bishop from large places, but František is “full of surprise – so we do not know who he appoints”.
GM downloads some new light trucks in the USA due to repair of seat-backs
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Automobile Safety Authority, General Motors downloads nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to repair the malfunction with manual loading.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism of loading the front seats may be faulty.
As a result, seatbacks are not in line with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the State Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if a car gets hit from behind, the head restraint does not have to protect the passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury. ”
Downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
GM announced the delivery to the market in June, and for this leading American car the most important placing on the market of the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the suppliers of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notification to the owners due to the 16-day incapacity of the government, which weakened the growth in car sales in October.
The sales of the Silverado and Sierra deliveries, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, GM announced on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares in the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4% on Friday afternoon to USD 37.47.
Desperate Cry of Obama's Voters
I voted on both of them twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have crippled the obstructions of the Republican Party.
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama's health care website or drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard.
I read a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year in medical school, it would encourage me to regain a little hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memory of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish my patients' assessments and go to bed tonight, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and your speeches took your breath away.
The elections ended with a crushing advantage and television coverage forced us to contemplate the historical value of the moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they had obtained.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
During its entry into office in 2008, Obama had support of 82%.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a bad awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
In the years after I threw in my first ballot, there really was a change.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – since the law on available care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of politics “to ask no questions, say nothing” after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that the party obstructions have reversed so much efforts to move our nation forward: among others it is immigration reform, the possibility for the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations in which I defended Obama's administration before my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit on the explanation that they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The opposition of the Republicans cannot explain their consent to the interrogation of foreign leaders or to the attacks of drones that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor by the fact that it pursues those who expose the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without a fair trial or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “more aggressive... than Nixon's administration”.
And most recently, they cannot even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on the accessible care of a simple website.
I don't know if anything like that could have been expected.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that government power could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function obviously has no predictable progress and our public talks will be created by the opposition political party and by random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have set out above seem to be largely the result of my own administrative decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted on both of them again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncut alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his politics or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, set free from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we had heard of.
However, the return by 2008 – with Obama's support falling below 45% this week – through this book becoming increasingly difficult.
It makes me remember a number of promises that have gone missing.
This week, I read a chapter on how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton at primary school in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave programme
Billionaire and Member Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave programme because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Banja Luka magnate, which is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax measure, made this claim when he tried to displace the question of whether he was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate to play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest about paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Mr Palmer a winner in the battle for the Fairfax District in the Sunshine Coast area thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an electoral review to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the election rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and get results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it true that the results can be balanced if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The electoral commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
The public office is a service to the public.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have come to the conclusion that he washes your hands and changes your mood.
The experiment was attended by 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving the insurmountable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure seemed much more optimistic than the ones where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "washed hands" did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of the 'washed' were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failures.
The results of the test show by psychologists that physical cleanness removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, though, the motivations are declining, the testers need to focus much more on other tests.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic on our way back from the toilet.
After using the toilet not only washes hands one percent Czech and Czech, but on the way by city transport it is already a fifth.
Most of the time, after working in a garden or in a workshop where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The pet’s caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as far as it is necessary to wash your hands after handing to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," said the skin doctor Claudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons aware of the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) has suspended two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities concerning suspected monetary market fraud is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they work with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where it changes owners of USD 5.3 billion every day.
These two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an expanding investigation to respond to the LIBOR-based scandal (London Interbank Interest Rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it had received an information request from the authorities this month.
"Our ongoing investigation in this matter continues and we cooperate fully with FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that RBS had submitted e-mails and instant messages sent from accounts and accounts to the British financial authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European President of Foreign Exchange Trade with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European President of Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher's group for sending quick messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people dedicated to this event.
This week, UBS stated that after the Swiss control authority informed Finland that it had investigated suspected movements in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antitrust Office of Weko, FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office – are investigating the claim that these bankers have joined forces to move with the monetary market.
In addition, the Commission notes that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have launched internal investigations or have received an information request from the competent authorities.
Banks are combed through years of high-speed news and e-mails to find cases of wrongdoing.
Investigative reports have intimidated traders in an area that was one of the biggest engines to generate profits in the closures of investment banks in the past years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that small currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market, it is virtually impossible to manipulate the situation, but high-level traders say that it is not necessarily true.
A highly-built trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily trading with foreign currency for the extraction of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, it means that "you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released from its department of stock trading this week, which caused a loss of almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperated with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded the thousands
Doctors in Prague have already registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of surveillance in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected throughout the Czech Republic.
Immunity failure has already broken down in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121.
In 2009, the survey revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
Last year's number dropped to 153, but on the contrary, it was record-breaking.
According to the lab, there were 212 of them.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1,710 males and 353 females.
AIDS broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city should head for the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk by a well-designed centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would betray the bedeck.
Many people "read from the graves".
They slowly wander through the cemeteries and gain an intimate view of local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what are the nationalities, what are the beliefs, how large and coherent families belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions are to them.
How they express their social standing, what they taste like.
And from the condition of the graves, they will also learn how to care for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama was in line with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
By the ratio of vote 5:4 the court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or threatens to pay the fine – does not deny the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Court President John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the 2700 pages of the Act and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining sick leave, would otherwise threaten to have all the financing of health insurance from federal sources not to be coerced and contrary to the Constitution.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have brought an action to block this law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the alleged proposed candidate Mitta Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a lame ass" there is no longer a threat to prison, the court has annulled the law
To date, Zimbabwe has had to take good care of the public talk about the ninety - eighty - nine - year - old Mugab, who has ruled the country since the early 1980 ’ s, and has been at its head since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the criminal law, a fine of $100 to one year of deprivation of liberty was threatened for contempt of the presidential office.
"The state representatives should not press charges against people who comment on the President at pubs or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the decision of the court, the British BBC informed.
A number of damaged Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, were loudly defined against the law, who were arrested two years ago by the police for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight with a policeman.
In May, he ended up in prison with an opposition activist frequenting in Mugabe's public adage of "blubbery donkey".
In August, the prosecutor accused a six-year-old man of his intention to use the poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The Court has also declared itself an anti-constitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statement will later prove false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malal.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to be criminalized for false statements has a chilling effect on the right to freely express himself," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a strong hand for more than 33 years, it adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps towards the dictatorship of one man took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the prime minister's chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and by 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009 the government completely abolished the national currency.
In Zimbabwe today, only currencies of other countries apply.
The deplorable economy goes to Mugabe's vortex of reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with walking the farm.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will enable banks to access global currencies whenever necessary.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economist of the Bank of London, Barclays.
"So far all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not surprising to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, the main economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007, when the international credit market first collapsed.
Central banks' agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of the central bankers comes at a time when the American Fed is preparing to end its support programme for the American economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is standardly used to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency in the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
You can view it as a currency deposit and a currency loan.
The ECB launches a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, and the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) clears personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it, because there was someone sitting on the branch who couldn't finish the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration went down, and then I moved out, and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it was not possible, because I have a different number of the OP, an address and that it is simply not possible to complete it and that I should request the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
So I did, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I am asking to delete all my personal data from the database under the applicable personal data protection law.
That's what the technical support said to me that I was going to finish my registration at the branch office.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th hurricane on 25.10. they wrote that personal data was erased at my request.
So one would say that he could make that new registration and here again began the problems first it wrote to me that my user name was already contained (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but eventually it was also excluded).
So I used a different username and it jumped out to me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration on the branch (how can they store something they claim to have erased?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question how it was possible to write down that personal data really erased 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that mistake.
I did this (about 3 p.m. yesterday) and today I was written down that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why I couldn't because I used the same name and date of birth.
What if I've been in contact with technical support for a week, and I'm thinking it's still impossible.
And what if it were true what he claims (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake e-mail and phone number and a world of wonders, and I came up with a page that they sent me an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs the registration to an e-mail and a phone number and the data just didn't turn off what he claims.
So again, I told this technical support that they're just lying (either intentionally or they don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing is not true.
I've proven several screenings that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
I'm sorry, but since you're registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication ended.
It repetitively repeats the same sentence that registration is bound to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in an email and it didn't actually take place.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only has not erased the data as he claims, but is still lying when he claims otherwise.
The worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things were moving a little bit, and from the Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter is being forwarded for verification and I will be informed (after a week of emergencies and arguing and warning of the same mistake).
Music plays on the subway on the Bridge
Prague has launched the Music project on the subway.
The first vestibule, where the repeated instrumental music plays continuously during the subway operation, is the Bridge of the line A at the exit to the Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
The writer Michal Horáček brought his new two-CD Czech calendar to the Hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only, but also, in particular, among us singers Lenka Novo, František Segrad and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěj Benk.
After the opening intro and the stage about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theatre and electric power fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise, in Cologne they produced two kinds of cards, with which I had a lot of contact," he recalled.
He also reminded the cousin of President Zeman.
"Perhaps we could make tours of Zakolany or Dubravka near Bratislava," he joked about other presidents' families.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the eagle, about ice hockey, but then he had no idea how we meet in the squares and scandal who doesn't jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, though, sang a very suitable song for him to sleep in the day, to sing at night, and to accompany him to her guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played the drums, then all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of a keyboard, a cello, a guitar and a bass.
All three vocalists, together, sang a little bit of a rip-off. The heart sat down, which immediately spread the stage.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which I wasn't surprised about in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, Hana Heger was reminded of the song by Dad, who loved the people of Baar and Horáček's explanation of the Communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, and Segrado sang a beautiful composition of Prague, composed by Jarda Svoboda, a grieving relative and former Kolínjak.
That was the conclusion, the applause in the stand and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was another addition on the playlist, but the fans didn't cheer.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire square sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček, her books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with potential interested parties took photos.
Berdyha and Štěpánek will be added to Rosol and Hájek
At the finals of Davis' cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav returned to four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they are going to play in the field of the rival to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 November to 17 November.
In the final, the Czechs have been the third in five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpanek, the winner of last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
U.S. command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites presented exactly what the bombing of Syria would look like.
Without unnecessary noise, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target, and they came back.
Without being swayed by the official disposal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole operation and no longer express themselves.
The exact opposite of confused and bigmouthed, acts of undeniable Obama's Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying thing about the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be confused with the media by their claims that a "sirassic base" or "supplies for Hizbalah" has been bombed.
I recently wrote here about the fact that while US aid to secular insurgents in the country remains only on rhetorical plains, Russia is happy to continue supplying arms to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian rockets unloaded at the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli attack.
That's a clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Assad's regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theories it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of the Special Forces, possibly Delta Force.
He had no idea until now that they had excelled during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city is known to me as members of the CIA's secret command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It's been speculation for a long time about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere in the CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any event, the information that the CIA has its own machine guns protected in Libya (right on one such both SEALs died after a mortar attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were part of the US command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of an attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA area in Benghazi.
Obama's administration is embarrassed by the fact that during that attack the command was not officially and entirely imposed and that it was simply hesitant about what to do.
The commander of the command is likely to release these volunteers without orders.
Anyway, the fact that it works not once in the country, but permanently American command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And since nothing has been officially admitted until recently, and even now it is only a matter of some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing the U.S. is trying to combat terrorism in Libya half the time.
Even though it would require much more help to resolve the country's situation.
The last place I want to write about a secret and permanent conflict is the coastline of Iran.
It's not as long ago as the media almost sang Iran's air force in pursuit of U.S. drones.
Few are known, however, how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if he happens to be able to detect his drone in the airspace, there's nothing to do with it.
However, if the Iranians are discovered in an international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in an international space over the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of US super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He subdued Phantom to optically verify his weapons without having Phantom register him on the radar or just noticed him, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without reptiling.
No wonder Phantom is an airplane of American production, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has recently failed, the defender or backup Viktorie Plzen František Rajtoral is in the form of a return to the team after one year.
He's also good at archery, he's up in activity, and after the procedure, a fine kick was ordered in the Teplice game.
Victoria touched in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after winning, but eventually she took one point out of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Frantisek Rajtoral.
The men are carefully preparing for a hard match with the North Bohemian players who play attack football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, as we always draw a lot from the video discussion of the game opponent.
"I believe Friday night will be a great match," attracts the Czech representative of a fan to the Doosan Arena stands.
The tides of the last fights did not go as she wished, but the word of the crisis defender Victoria refuses.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape, and sometimes you're in worse shape.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," Western defender said.
Victoria's men will rely again on the support of fans.
"He's playing Friday night, and that's why I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them by winning," says Rajtoral.
Jana Petťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big leap -- a leap a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like not to worry and just come out of school and wash the dishes, relax and do your homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just a theory, a parent's wish.
Practice was completely different - run from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Playing ball games with other kids, jumping shots.
Then, on Helena and her boys' show, she sews a chained-stitch dress for her grandmother's birthday.
And then after a few warnings finally wash the dishes, relax, in winter apply the wood to the tiled stones and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the fellow student and instead of writing the beloved verses of the addressed school love).
In the morning to eat homemade strawberry jams (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, whose contents were not even laid) and to drink it with tea from dried herbs that Mom and I enjoyed so much.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a tomb silence in the room when my sister and I recorded the songs from the radio on the tapes that were loud in the old cassette book after my mom.
And then on the pen, we would turn the tapes over and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and we would toast to it with a syphon.
Or we used to call each other over the table using cans that were tied together with a rope - and while we were on the phone to get a better hearing, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the earrings were cheese plus cotton.
The minimum wage was over three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live out of it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or brand clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "approach" in the wardrobe was a buttoned-up T-shirt of domestic production with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the tape of Mom's tape, and most of all, Walkman, who we shared with our sister, and who we used only on a train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I have already said, "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and I'm sure his parents had saved him a long time, but unfortunately he hadn't warmed up in a long time.
My little sister put a strudel in him, said he was so good at taping those tapes, she tried to sleep on the strudel.
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, and this event has so far, poor thing, on my dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she put the strudel in the video and thought she'd play the recipe and not play it, which is why she can't bake it today.
I remember how we all managed to communicate together, make arrangements without a cell phone, without a computer.
My sister and I got together on the holidays at Grandma's house with our neighbor's granddaughter when we meet again next summer at Grandma's - and that's what it was, so it worked.
We've met.
Promise me you'll see someone in a year!!
I also remember in winter, when we were running out with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill near a church on a sack full of hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard this notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have a lemon soap in your bathroom.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" at the beer with Jarda from the village, we lay down with Mom on the floor, put our feet against the tile stone, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackling of the wood that was pouring out of the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write daily messages through different chats, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew far more about each other.
And that way, I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at the album, where the black corners are carefully taped with black and white photos.
And if I didn't happen to know how old I was then, there's always a year of taking the picture from behind.
I'm looking at that, although the cut by the pot wasn't very good and we had two bigger cousin pants, no one was laughing at us before, it was so normal (not even IN).
And I'd rather go back that step forward - to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting for modern times to come up with, like, once for my kids.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are now for a young teenage generation so at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they're losing a lot of time that they won't be able to live this "overtime" either.
I wish they would!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents from the missing company Nortel, filed an action Thursday to violate the patent against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was re-elected as part of Nortel's bankruptcy bid.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued the US District Court in Texas by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps to combine the terms found on the Internet with appropriate advertising, states the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately detained.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on the operating system of Google Android, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of USD 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to USD 4.4 billion.
Following the defeat of Nortel in the fight for patents by Rockstar, Google won $12.5 billion from Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by Motorola's patent group.
“Despite the failure to obtain patents that are the subject of a dispute in the auction, Google patents has violated and continues to violate”, the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation for the damage from Google, as it considers that there is a violation of the patent by Google intentionally, as the lawsuit claims.
Miloslava Czeipková: November Smile
She's come out, four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put off her smile, the one who kept putting on the reins as a defense against the friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved, because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only the days she was a grandmother and had Elinka or Adík's grandchildren around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson from endless courses in business skills.
Now they're really good.
So she doesn't forget her loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like a disguise on a masquerade.
November, or another month, she can't do the miracle to smile really, like when she was on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt lists the first elected president as office
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day will hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt ” when he was solemnly appointed as the first elected president of this country, after Huss Mubarak, who was set up 16 months earlier.
In his office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black plates in a house built with a view of the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who, after most of 84 years since its inception, has been an illegal organization targeted by the sharp attacks of individual governments.
When Mursí arrived shortly after 11:00 local time in a small convoy of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential manifestation, the transport was only briefly stopped so that the convoy could normally take a busy road connecting the city centre to the suburbs in the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, which is ridiculously referred to as the noncharist “reservative tyre” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown rapidly since his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists but also all those who want to end the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie of judges in a wood-covered chamber, where he swore an oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to give an inauguration speech.
While he was standing by, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of the Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture room of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a garden of Islamic student movements.
Mursí made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrír Square, where a revolution was born that ended last year's authoritarian government of Mubarak, and solemnly promised to recapture the presidential powers taken over by his office by the military council, which took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before a court of law, rather than before parliament, as it is the custom, the will of the military has been challenged, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There's probably gonna be police specialists in the ghettos, they're supposed to ease the tension.
Police specialists should be involved in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend as much as half their time here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people from the surrounding areas.
The Ministry of the Interior shall take account of this in its proposal to reduce security risks.
According to him, "accelerated social housing" would help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were some 300 houses and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They were home to 80,000 people, especially Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dose-dependent, children ended up in "special" schools.
There's an interest rate.
In the meantime, according to experts, hundreds of troublesome sites have arrived.
The relationship between their inhabitants and others is growing.
Anti-Romania marches took place in several places.
Extremists were also joined by people from around the world.
Internally, police are demanding in areas with ghetto security and order.
The basic condition is "constant application of equal access to the exercise of law".
But it is not possible to achieve this without detailed knowledge of the place and of the people.
A specialist would go for trips in the ghetto, where he would spend as much as half of his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
In a troubled area, he'd keep an eye on order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or transgressions.
"Thanks to confidence-building, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole series of illegal acts," the inside said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive an extra 500 to 1,000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be financed from the Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now approximately CZK 15.5 million).
Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, a detailed proposal is now being processed.
The project is due to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully implemented in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," said the authors of the report.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis to determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to release after the project is completed each year.
According to the project's proposal, first elected officers are taking up internships in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should go through this training annually.
They'll be the most suitable candidates.
Special training should also arise for police officers who will be involved in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the inside, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards should be social housing that is comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan that would be drawn up by social workers.
They would have to comply with the housing policy, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move into a higher standard of living.
The progressive housing system should operate internally for at least 30 years until the next generation is raised "in a pro-inclusively motivated environment".
The model of social housing is being prepared by local development and labour resorts.
They'll have it by the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Coal top - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The carbon summit is a spectacular hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jessenika at a time (geologically) recent.
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the fourth.
In view of the greater distance, there is an apparent white-refused Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Auxiliary, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The hostess who stood next to the church did not behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley was dropped from four rows of Lips, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Upper Carniola is already the third version, the original was here after 1916, the second from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
On 15 stops are wooden plastics made by the local artist sculptor František Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Jessen region.
Similarly, the base of the mountain from the area is an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also given on each stop.
The carbon summit is the rest of the young volcano.
Although data from radiometric measurements vary somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years old) and older than Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born an explosion.
She threw out a large amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the floors, which had reddish brown in the fire.
At the end of this phase, the lava surface has leaked - today it is a layer of porous chalice up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption threw out red, brown, and black tufts.
Their layer is as powerful as 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the fracture.
There are visible volcanoes up to 1 meter long in the tuffs, and the second eruption was completed by lava discharge.
At the end of the volcano activity, lava, which now forms up to 50 m of the powerful layer of the oyster.
The volcanoes where volcanic ash is replaced with lava is the most common type of volcano.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they're called stratavolcanos.
The original volcano cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, he was threatened with mining in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tufas were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The claim was managed under the pressure of both experts and the public to stop and thus maintain this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porousness and low consistency of the fast - blowing, decaying, and downwards.
Lom's disappearing so fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You will be able to reach the Coal Mountains by the green tourist brand from Bruntal, or from Silesian Kočov, if necessary.
Automobiles can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the Lip alley, where a short learning trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Orěchovka.
However, the original owners of the house obtained it in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Thus, she quickly sought a replacement home for herself and her older mother.
From friends she received a tip on apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor on the large woodshed and the dam on the other hand inspired me," she recalls.
At first, I thought it would be a commission for about three years.
"Today we have lived here for more than 13 years, and not just because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a one-hundred-and-a-half-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner knocked down the core, but the owner was most disturbed by an unpractically solved and unnecessarily large tunnel, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The connection between the two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used to define the individual zones and the separation of the room sardicon, which enabled the new position of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to take after a few years was the removal of the barrier in the living room.
The apartment changed to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery opened.
The next step towards partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminated floor.
She didn't know what to do with Ivan's bathroom.
For years, I've been picking up magazines about housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
I therefore addressed young architect Kamila Douděr on the recommendation.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivan.
Thanks to the renovation of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available airways.
The architect connected the toilet and bathroom space and two doors with open wings replaced with one scroller, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
The quality covers imitate the sandstone, plus a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower in the bathroom.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděr continued.
As part of the show How to build a dream, there was a quick but fundamental change of living room, in which also architect Martin Čeněk participated.
We had to get three functions, dining room, living room and sleeping in a space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-converses or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a violation of the openness and unity of space," the architect explains.
We were able to separate the original sleeping and living parts.
Just turn your back on two couches and put a sizeable box on your feathers.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a quality marmaloleum, and the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
If necessary, the kitchenette shall cover the sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor of the anti-allergic mammoleum has a number of advantages as compared to the previous laminate: softer non-slip surface without spores and better sound insulation.
The color-embossed sashboard system is an example of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The cover made of graphos with the motif of the flowered magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm energy tone, architects have chosen a white style that underpins modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were saved, among other things, into the space under the window parapets.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the remodeled interior, the contrast of the new one works perfectly with the older one, for example, with a ten - year - old crystal mirror and with quality art items that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
The last one came up with the kitchen.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a little bit like it was in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and translated the placement.
The furniture in the simple design is made for custom, the white area softens slightly the pearl surface.
Thanks to an ideal solution of washing machine, dryer and dishwasher, they entered a small space.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived a glass bed of walls above the work desk.
Unique graphic glass with digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom was a small tub and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cover.
The big shower has a glass door, Ronald.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and equipment will be harmonious.
The interior was materially and colourfully united and we tried to find its elegant, cosy, not overcrowded appearance.
"Another condition for setting was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the reachability of objects of daily need," adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled: There is no time to prosecute.
The Supreme Court ruled that the former Prime Minister, Peter Neča, could also be prosecuted for possible criminal acts that he could have committed before August's dissolution of the House of Deputies.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS Members Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajr and Peter Tluchora, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they gave up the parliamentary mandate last November, said the spokesman for the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
This decision was rejected by the Court of Justice of Iv Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the approval of laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to pursue the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
They also arrested an officer of the anti-corruption police with Vitti Barta
Bart's attorney, Oldrich Poordob, who also represented him in the cause of alleged VV corruption, also did not want to express himself too much about the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but in view of the protection of the hidden facts I cannot continue to comment on it."
According to information, the Law case solves the General Inspection of the Security Corps (GIBS).
The server, i.e., said that Bart was able to buy classified information from the police.
According to the server, the case may have been related to the case of former police President Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Bart was allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that the arrest of Vita Bartha with Peter Lessy is unrelated.
Police President Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case with the Prague City Attorney's Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of the hidden facts," the spokesman for the City Attorney's Office in Prague, Štěpánka Zenklová, said on Friday.
It is the case that is overseeing Bart’s case there, and thus it is not directly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in the regime of secrecy.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vita Barta Kateřin Klasnov in the morning before their residence in Prague Klárov.
She was just loading the bags into the car and leaving.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Christmas Tomio Okamura movement expressed himself to Bart's arrest.
According to his own words, he has no idea what's going on in the case.
"To welcome Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member nor a member of the dawn of direct democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bart, who failed to run for the direct democracy of Tomia Okamura in the previous early elections to Parliament in the Plzeň Region, is known for his corrupt cause of paying the members of the Public Affairs Council.
In April 2012, he was unlawfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
After the verdict was changed, Bart was acquitted of the charges.
I want a contract at the NHL.
I still have suction, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospala, the family was always first, so at 38 years of age, they want to submit to her completely.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's gonna extend his career, or he's definitely gonna end up with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I look forward to it," says a hockey player who is still in vain waiting for an offer.
Even though he's a registered employee who never cheats on anything.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time, he can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive Columbus player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he declares.
Maybe he'll wait, apparently he's being held by the New York Rangers, who didn't make it into the season, and they've got two strikes - Rick Nash's attackers and Ryan Callahan's.
What does it look like to you coming to Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that they should sign, but that's all.
Nowhere else has it been delivered that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce for myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't you hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the contract really does come off.
Sometimes a player gets hurt or someone doesn't get hurt and a manchaft doesn't come off.
There are a lot of different factors that need to be met together to get the contract.
But in New York, that's exactly what happens, isn't it?
The injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to happen?
I've had the expectations since the NHL opened up the free-player market on July 5th, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
He's given because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what makes everything go away.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
On Sundays, Vasík has two hockey games, which is a holiday for me and my entire family when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this on full-time import tickets?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches for knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
One day, it'll get to such a stage that all the goals, the winnings, and the games won't replace what you've got at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have met me apart from my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, sports success also comes first - except for the family.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so I'm sorry, our children - my children and my women - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we'd love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're going to do is, there's a possibility somewhere else in America.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic at Hluboké and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps take us.
That's perfect, being still warm.
I've been so lucky in my life.
You could say I walked across from him, it cost him a lot of strength and denial, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long will you have at your age the will to work out, to train hard, and to wait for the offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna be there.
You can't plan that.
So you can say that you'll wait this season for it to roll out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I go day after day.
Recently, CEZ Director General announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and by agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
These are the reasons the current CEZ leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, the majority shareholder.
A qualified manager should, however, make recommendations to shareholders and not hide behind them.
Babish: Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create one at all.
The president of YES admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will take place tomorrow.
Trade and marketing of ŠkoFIN leads Abrahamek
Its competences include product and marketing and enhanced cooperation with business partners.
He replaced the Man Shantor in office.
Abrahamek has linked his professional career to the automotive sector for the last 14 years.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last appearance was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the Automotive Division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated part of the airport in Los Angeles for shooting.
There was a shooting at an international airport in Los Angeles this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly three terminals.
Reuters with an appeal to the California media says the men of the law shot an armed man with a gun.
The Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, reported that there was a gunfight in which two or three members of the Transport Security Administration were injured.
How many people were injured and if they were any victims, it's still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about events with more wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian rockets for Hizballah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed US government official, CNN reported it.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli army's spokesman refused to comment on the raid.
"We do not express ourselves to reports from foreign media," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the target of the Israeli attack was rockets and related equipment that the Israelis believed could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement Hizballah.
The AP agency, with reference to another US security officer, reported that Russian SA-125 missiles were the target of an Israeli attack on the Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the aim of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the area of attack but according to the DPA agency showed the batteries of Russian S-125 Nova missiles.
In addition, they said that the SA-3 rockets included a command centre with a radar to track missiles and their targets.
According to an Israeli television report, recorded rockets have a range of 35 kilometres and could carry a 70 - kilogram [70 kg] head.
Israel has reportedly bombed at least twice this year on the supply of missiles inside Syria, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli army had never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would attack any shipment of weapons intended for Hizbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated the estimate of annual profits and expects record profits from holidayers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel agency now expects its annual base profit before tax to be between USD 325 million and USD 340 million compared to USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in the record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight percent profit in the first half of the year and began to grow rapidly during the second half of the year, mainly in Australian and British travel off business trips.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreational activities took place during the second half of Australia, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The US trade has recovered after a loss during the season's weaker half-years and is expected to bring the third year in a row of year's profits.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists have been detained since September in Russia for protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic and have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
Today, the AFP has informed this with a reference to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges of her pirate activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after an unviolent action against the oil rig in the Arctic were transported from the Murmansk Correctional Facility to the prison in St Petersburg," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for the transfer of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA it was a planned move.
The environmental authorities first charged them with piracy, which, if convicted, threatened them for up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that the indictment would replace this with a milder riot, which threatens a lower sentence with the upper limit of seven years of deprivation of liberty.
But in today's statement, Greenpeace has pointed out that the allegations of piracy have not yet been dropped as promised.
That means the arrests are now charged with two crimes.
Last week, a powerful investigation committee announced that the allegations of piracy would replace the charges of embezzlement.
But when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, a new indictment was brought against everyone," the AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil rig in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody, although they've filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
On prison terms, environmentalists complain.
According to AFP, Greenpeace CEO Kumi Naidoo today said that moving to St. Petersburg will make it easier for those detained with families and consular personnel.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact they may be worse," he warned.
Dutch King Willem-Alexandra asked for help from one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch invited him to discuss their situation during a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fighting in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, at least one Shakespeare game, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied from 1914 onward.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
The combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language degree and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new basics for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Offqual, which oversees the exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the exam, together with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was “a broad consensus as to whether we needed to reform our testing system to regain the trust of society” and that we needed to insist that the graduation test was “more demanding, ambitious and stricter”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of the school in Australia, mathematics is given on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138 hours.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math exam – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the results ladders – will likely encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “the problems of the real world,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Prime Minister Kaynar: Cancer in the CzechSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-standing dispute erupted between the two wings fighting for influence within the Istrian Czech Republic.
It all came to an end when the Prime Minister of Ostrava, Petr Kaynar, turned to trial for the undemocratic formation of candidates.
The actors of the cause, however, did not want to express themselves too much to harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the votes of the electorate have been counted.
The management of the Istrian Czech Republic so immediately on Monday evening invited the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step aside, and will probably also push to lose his post.
Peter Kaynar wants to keep fighting.
What is at stake in disputes and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Diník.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
ČSSD certainly counted with a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our house that before the elections, there were disputes inside the party?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which ČSSD is now.
It's a party that has its own internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel it's not all right.
They made it clear in the election.
What are these internal diseases of the Czech Republic?
For some time now, I think the ODS has been going through the collapse, and unfortunately, similar things are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their bands at the ODS, moved to the people in the CzechSSD and influenced them.
It's related to the fact that the Icelandic magistrate's offices are being used by the police to collect computers.
It shows that the Czech Republic is not only made up of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own interests.
ČSSD is divided into two incomprehensible camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been going on a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foregleam of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hague wing gradually occupied its positions so that after the elections it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotko's wing.
A man is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to take compromises.
But everyone has an internal limit when they don't go through these compromises anymore, and that's my case.
Initially, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I noticed the whole thing inside the Party, I agreed with Lubosh Zaoralek that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotkov's wing as the Prime Minister of Ostrava.
But the Hague wing gave us a clue.
Why are you standing on the side of Boguslav Sobotka and not Michal Hasek?
In my opinion, Slavek Sobotka is a person who always talks mainly about the ČSSD programme and to a certain extent about visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit I've never heard anything like it on the other side.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power no matter what and against the parties.
In my opinion, what Michal Hasek has now shown in Prague has ended his political career.
As you have noticed, the Czech Republic's leadership on the candidate did not approve of you.
The political parties are based on competition, which of their members will be placed.
This competition should, for the most part, be based on programming visions and on the ability of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much power or vision in this competition, but the political side is an elevator to money they would not otherwise receive.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead of themselves by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the laws of the parties.
They make their practices from the political side of the mafia, and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Kaiser has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the regulations.
Is that why you submitted before the elections a motion for a preliminary action against the form of the Czech Republic's candidate in the Moravian Silesia region?
The current District Executive Committee of the Czech Republic in Ostrava is empowered by the fact that the organisations that do not comply with it can cancel, purposely establish new organisations, gradually dismissing the uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is that they wanted Richard Bednarík to be expelled from the representative club, but he filed a complaint against it and then they lifted the ruling on his expulsion.
This shows that pursuing the party's positions through the courts is the last option, but at the moment that the other ways and control authorities within the Czech Republic have ceased to operate, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Istrian Czech Republic in the lead with Member Adam Rykala is to recall you from the position of primary.
It is a public secret that Mayor Lumír Palyza is behind this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Pallyza are trying to do everything they can to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they win votes, and then they strengthen their power in their side.
When I go back to the past, all that happened around Baník Ostrava football club and buying the Basel Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me as the person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that is strategically valuable to it.
How, then, do you continue to see this with your stay as a primary?
The District Committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the Czech Republic.
But I think it's like a thief yelling, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I see no one in the island's social democracy who would initiate and push, sometimes even against the party members, the emergence of so much development, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, I'm becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than to prevent others from breaking into the places they want.
Are you going to fight these efforts again?
Because if this republic is to function well, then the political parties must work well.
It's hard for me to believe that any side will be able to drive effectively if they can't drive themselves.
So I don't think I'd be leaving the Czech Republic now, because I think the one who causes this side's cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens in the historical center of the public ice-skating
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas Markets and Winter Skating, Pavel Spálen, said that the preparatory work on the rink had been started on October 26th and since Wednesday there was an aggregate for the production of ice.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The slope has an area of 375 square meters, the podium takes 358 square meters.
The skaters and the passersby will also have two pancake stands.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the space before the stands and almost the entire floor area is covered so that the skaters can move comfortably," said Burnen.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminded of the coming Christmas.
Last year, a rink was installed in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square for repairing the Lower Square.
Repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original location.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the council in 2009, when the ice-skating site was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural programme, will start a month before Christmas Day in the Upper Square.
Pamela Anderson had those iconic blonde hairdressers ripped off and put on a new, dramatic rustic haircut.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlinsk will again be decided by the regional court
The Regional Court acquitted the defendants of a twenty-five-year-old Slovak and a twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They're facing 15 to 20 years in prison or even a special sentence.
The speaker, Petr Angyalossy, confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the regional decision and returned the matter to him.
He refused to comment on the reasons why the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men abducted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
Senior died a painful death.
According to the prosecution, he was strangled, beaten, and dug all over his body, and also by a metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds to his head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding to the brain that he succumbed to on the spot.
The youths reportedly took some 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns out of the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, in addition, circumstantial evidence against the defendants of the stench which the expert considered not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although the scent of the crime scene and other cases coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as material and not odour marks.
In addition, certain doubts were found when handling them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proved without doubt.
However, the court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he'd fallen and hurt himself.
There was no warning of a violent death by a medical examiner.
So after a few days, the criminals contacted the fractured doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene that relatives had cleaned up.
There was no DNA on the defendant.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed last year by a competent Olomouc Supreme Court.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who had been deliberately robbed of gold.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopno.
The younger of the accused of the murder of a senior lives in Uherské Hradišta.
The court released him from custody in August of 11 months.
The sweat begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium begins in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was being taken over by construction workers who would reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojm is divided into four stages so that it meets the standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week The strings of autumn
The saxophone giant and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the next Wednesday point for the 18th anniversary of the Struna Autumn festival.
Shorter will appear on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under Martin Kumžák is added to Shorter.
In Shorter's version of the Symphony Orchestra, Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Struńs of autumn will launch his world tour.
Wayne Shorter joined the world of music over 60 years ago.
The list of interpreters he worked with ranges from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese cousin Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade they gave direction to a new style of fusion.
For the last 13 years, he's been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Some afterparty after the festival will still be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9th at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrei Triany with the local audience will present the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
She says she forbids UEFA to publish sentences for the referee.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the Board of Judges of the Czech Football Association, stopped publishing sentences for the judges.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, which she stated in the interview for the journal Law.
Otherwise, he'd be threatening FAČR strikes.
Damk also refused to side with the football players Pilsen where they came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of the vote I can lose 1:6," said Damk in reaction to criticism, which broke up after Plzeň has recently played twice as many penalts as other league teams.
Thus, although the FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for the referee in recent months, Damková assures that they are suing for their mistakes.
"Trust me that if the commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, regardless of the game," Damk said.
The reason why the penalties are not being published is according to the Damak ban on the European Football Union.
"The publication of such information prohibits and severely punishes infringements."
"We're very suspicious, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop doing so, severe sanctions will come," Damk said.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the publication of information continued, the Commission would say that the money from the UEFA could be lost to the training and development of the judges.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them we would not be able to fill the programme for the training of the judges," Damk added.
Barta's detention is related to Janoushek and Bem: Is he behind the leak of wiretaps?
On Thursday, the police arrested Vita Bart, President of the Council of Public Affairs.
Along with him was also the head of the board of analysts and informatics of the anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the interviews of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Prime Minister Paul Bém (ODS).
Information about the follow-up that came from the News.cz server was confirmed by the Czech Press Office by a reliable source.
The intercepted phone calls by Janouška and Béma, published last March by the journal Young Front Today, in which both men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janouškov's influence on the steps taken by the city under Bem's leadership.
The journal then stated that in 2007 they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS), of which two years later they fled to the ABL security agency.
That's where Bart owned it.
The News.cz server pointed out that the detained criminalist Petržilek was working for the BIS before he joined the anti-corruption police.
To the anti-corruption unit that was subsequently involved in the wiretap, Petržílek moved on at the same time that they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can neither confirm nor say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City Attorney's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the cause.
The case does not comment for the same reason on the inspection.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies out of ten are preparing intensively for the forthcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies interviewed said that the issues related to the two key codes in their company were not dealt with at all.
This comes from a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, a law firm that examined the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming deadline for the effectiveness of both key codes, a number of managers are beginning to realize at the last minute what a significant impact their companies can have on their business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic, in our opinion.
The lavender of politicians has left the business sector in a long period of uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move to a new law without complications for their companies," Ambruz & Dark Deloitte partner Legal Jan Spáčil commented.
Of the 61 percent of intensive companies involved in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies in this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the contrary, every fifth firm has not yet dealt with the registrations, yet it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that the issues related to the record-keeping have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal topic related to the new civil code is for the largest number of companies interviewed to conclude new contracts (21 per cent), the solution to the trading conditions (16 per cent) and the changes in the real estate cadastra and the liability for damage (ten per cent).
For contracts, one of the most important innovations will take place in the whole of the re-regulation, namely the unification of the contract arrangements only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, resulting in a more transparent contract law for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many news with emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relations," counsel Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddáný noted.
With regard to the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibilities of statutory authorities as the most important topic.
The following are the topics relating to the changes in the convening and course of the general meeting (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14%).
The new legislation means tightening obligations and possible effects for statutory authorities, particularly in situations where companies are at risk of falling or entering the company.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the board and the directors of the firm do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the threatening collapse of the company, they may lose the benefits gained in the performance of the function until the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier’s style develop as a living language
My task is to preserve tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview for HN its position as Pierre Rainero, director of style in Cartier.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
Travels through the mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwell and his team will treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for CNN Hero Award in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates in the CNN 2013 competition.
The winner gets $250,000 so he can continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father pass out again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain and created a hematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwell.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment as was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwell says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwell’s father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwell says.
With poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwell saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed a free 700 operations last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at a central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he founded a nonprofit organisation, ASCOMIM, whose members visit rural areas on weekends, where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their volunteer group.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into deliveries, attach medical supplies to the roofs, and travel rough terrain to villages in need of help.
Not always accompanied by happiness.
Suddenly, the vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted as real heroes: feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate and Bwell – with his broad smile and untangled energy – is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every trip," Bwelle says.
They come to the village about 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get beers or gifted glasses or free birth certificate – a document that the school requires, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing simple surgery under local narcosis.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, a town hall or a home; after surgery the patient gets up and goes to a recovery site to release the patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and sanitary equipment Bwell and his volunteers work in the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"Let's stay up and keep working, play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – conducted 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to locals.
One man said after the hernia surgery, he'll be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
It says that this second job is funding about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest covers private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
“Dr Bwell, we thoroughly washed our hands and removed blood stains or held his instruments,” says O'Malley.
You'll never have that as a med student in your second year in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their way to Cameroon on their own and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaoundé, food, transportation and study are provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, constant restraint is not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwell says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh, alleviating their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Take a look at the ASCOMIM website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát reinstated the role of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - representatives to whom they can always turn, if necessary," explained Martin Holcat, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the nurses' work, and I think the field of nursing deserves proper attention from the Ministry.
In carrying out this profession, it is necessary not only to be highly professional, but also to have a human approach and a personal conviction.
"I will be pleased and responsible to seek to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled sisters in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients to make their calls with all empathy and help us in the public eye to improve the image of the sisters," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her introduction, that she wanted to address various aspects of the nurse's position of work and intended to work with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors, among others.
"I don't really want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own competences, and together with other health workers, they form a team of workers who provide health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself face a number of problems that arise in the performance of the sister's profession, these difficulties I perceive and intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring that medical and medical documentation is simplified.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative actions of the sister are unnecessaryly burdening them and wasting their time which they could and should rather devote to patients," said Alena Šmídová.
Other areas that it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve team cooperation and management of health service providers, adapting competences and also labour law issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or not burdening their sisters with insufficient numbers at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous stings, but they are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the function of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and a specific case should be checked by the competent authorities," closes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the University of Karlovy in Prague in the field of nursing (she graduated in 1978) and graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the program of nursing - pedagogy (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has served as Head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-medical Services and Recognition of Qualifications in the Ministry of Education and Science.
During her professional career she worked as a sister in a bed in the interior department, and continued to serve as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also eight years of statutory representative of the director.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the main sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several expert study books on nursing and articles in expert journals, and she gave lectures in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
To keep me from hating myself.
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VACLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
The number of pages is comparable to the most famous work by Houstina (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu was confessed by another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't look down on hate.
Seeing all the time new and new clones of this foolish little thing, young organisms affected by blindly selfish efforts.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by powerless greed, ecclesiastical souls and vice versa by ideologies who are trying to express small whores to sell their "product".
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a little digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdos, and hidden units.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamp tonight.
You're talking about the feeling of dreary, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like all of us?
The fracture occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, after that, I lived.
But there's still a little boy in there who's still surprised.
I see other lonely trainers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved from writing books.
I'm participating in this obsessive, thousands of years of the ongoing movement of the system of life on this planet -- the birth of an unfathomable future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when each stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when by the way of trial-omyl there is another and another generation of beings that in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you think of your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self - speaking, or rather, dialogue, which leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the level and forms into a book.
Like the period of peace covered quietly by sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the silent avalanche of my life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll be quietly overwhelmed.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and placed on layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cerebral cortex, asks the older evolutionary forces, goes to the ancient circles of the brain tree.
He's talking to the furry beasts, asking the snakes, looking for an answer in flight of birds, raising his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain is asking the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
In its billions of connections and electrochemical connections, the brain retains all the memories, experiences and experiences that the individual has experienced.
This forest, logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, I am exposed to constantly variable presence, in a relentless effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there'll be overload disorders.
Analogly - as if you "fall" PC, from a speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages you would be wrapped first in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after several failed restarts ended up with a dark green flashing screen of Bios, in a basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For someone who hasn't understood what this is about - I'm talking about a psychotic crisis.
You mention her a lot - why do you care about this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the current functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a gap.
Here it is good to read Nietzsche: "He looked so long into the abyss when the doom looked upon him."
The rice feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "die" and new quality comes along.
And why do I care about that in person?
I'll answer with similarities.
Once one fell into a ton and melted, days ran, months and years, he was still melting and reading, and those books taught him how to swim - that is to say, to live.
He became a diver.
I hope someone will be able to help me with some written sentence like the one that used to help me with the Countal texts.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
One who can't say anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think that's what Arthur Rimbaud described best in his letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
Since his youth, he has read the books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nema, running around the Shadows in dark alleys.
After all, behind all the branching of the authors and their message, it is "the sun brightens the worlds of other Charles Hynek Mácha".
What if the book's out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
In retrospect, who gets to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, on the street, they accidentally contact me and thank me for helping them with their hard life decisions with my book.
In fact, books are "life" or, rather, "worlds".
They're encoded in letters, they have experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them to life, we can let their sentences flow to the brain.
It is, in its own way, something forbidden to the divine - to pierce other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in a charm - according to the old demonological books, we allow witchcraft.
After the book has been published, as it happens, there will be a chain of readings.
I remember you used to read.
You gonna throw yourself back into it with joy, or do you feel different after years?
I'd rather just tell the story tonight.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they're subtle, they don't pay too much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiation, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope he's still alive) one curly bookshop (called by chance Chervenka), a cheerful friend and a good girl bull.
In one piazza, he introduced the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houstina.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
In my despair, I had just put off my mornin' morning, and soon I wept.
The silences were all standing there, nodding, and the drunks were crying.
Then the little blonde half-breed couldn't stand it, and with a roar, he jumped out of the window into the snow curtain.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the nightland and swarmed with a happy rage of sensitive people, a painful soul of landscapes and a handful of fallen natives - poured out and moaned like werewolves until morning.
Each book of yours is formal and substantively different from the previous one.
Is it also true about the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts the word of an old Russian myth into the mouth of the people's healer: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a bitch, there's a gray box on it.
Horrible, scary, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be devils in hell and draw - what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a remarkable way of dialogue.
Something huge and indescribable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in such a wideness that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so with absolute certainty we are doing precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we glow compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of the ocean unconscious and in a leaky sail made of dirty tissue catches the tides of the damp wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama retreats from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it".
With hundreds of thousands of notices of notices from providers, the Republicans have been accusing the President of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama came out of his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called “a disturbance in the media ” about the statements, Obama called on the Americans who had received these notifications to search for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 per cent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the scheme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on Available Care.
"I tell these Americans on the level: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the launch of the internet market has been "poor" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
Ms Sebelius, who was caught by the microphone on, spoke yesterday to a consultant sitting behind her at the Committee's meeting yesterday, following a violent exchange of views with the Republic of Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, concerning whether she must be involved in Obama's care programme herself.
Over three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly asked why the “architect” of the Available Care Act had not voluntarily surrendered to the government of sponsored insurance, and had not purchased the program through HealthCare.gov, which now compels millions of Americans.
What billionaire are you gonna call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, there is already a hand in the sleeve.
The transaction notice should be issued in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, before 11 November.
Keller's competitor, Karel Komárek, owns KKCG.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it auctioned frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's taste in telecommunications was not discussed.
But now Sazku is run by a very experienced telecommunication pet named Robert Hwatal.
He started as a marketing head of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became director of Slovak T-Mobile and finally headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
Under normal circumstances, Vodafone would not like this, but according to the Economic Newspapers it could be part of much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing O2 and T-Mobile operators, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a tender on LTE networks (as a newcomer may irritate a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not need to be auctioned at all, he will not be disturbed by the irritation of only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Saska.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G/3G network (a newly built LTE network at a frequency of 900 MHz), thus allowing the company a quick start of the network.
In the meantime, the plot will start building a freight network of LTE, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend money on a firm internet provider or cable TV.
What about Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately acquired a full operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mole waiting for restructuring.
At the auction, the LTE network would have won Kellner already for O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already announced that the networks will share.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And since next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two Titans of the Czech business against global giants.
Will the Czech TV ever be around without signatures?
In the era of President Zeman, she entered a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to hear complaints that gather evidence of the strain of the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of such a Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tzrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
It's true, the management has stopped by the editors.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where some journalists' propensity to zemanists is taken - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathic affection.
And when we assume general perversion, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, equally unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change the relationship on television are seeking.
The truth is, those who say that there are no direct attempts to intervene politicians in advanced countries.
The truth is, too, that does not mean that there would be no public media complaints.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the product of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilisation stage yet, and we don't have this situation.
Perhaps, however, in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an opaque situation that affects the behavior of many imperfect human beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: the presidents at the side of the force
It is almost a rule that in key moments the head of state was not in such a form that he could fulfil his civil duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have been slightly different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could have fled to London immediately and not fought hard for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the surrender wouldn't have made the nation hangover to this day.
Benesh was not a statesman, and he was still in good shape for Munich, but during the wars, he started going off the hill with him, and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
He could have gone into exile for the third time and broken the legitimacy of the communists and their coups.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They chose him by saying that "Mr. President will not get in the position to decide."
But he had to, even though it wasn't a big decision with a knife to his neck at Hitler's office.
The chief of intelligence, František Moravec, told the Germans until the last days of March 1939 that everything should be done so that the occupation he knew about for the day would not go so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, and they were afraid.
The human wreck Gottwald had his senior comrades executed, as Moscow ordered him to.
Ludwik Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in normalization and had to sit him down, completely senile.
That Husak was a helpless and sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only foundation.
Havel's been lucky he hasn't been seen in the office in years, he's been spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, many of his actions give the impression that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now here's what we got.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic now.
Or maybe it's threatening, but it's not so visible.
Then the question is, is it not particularly good (from a historical point of view) that the President is not entirely strong.
But it's not normal.
Couldn't we have elected a president in this country once again to be an acceptable thinker and an acceptablely healthy one?
Remote planets, black and white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw ice cream.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6th in the great hall of the Prague Lucerna will complete this year's anniversary of the Struna Autumn festival, everything is connected with everything.
Wayne Shorter's quartet of jazz saxophonist quartet is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his commission, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they are experiencing right now.
They treat music as a fully improvised chamber matter and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, of course, is freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, carrier of nine Grammys, former co-player of Miles Davis and today perhaps the biggest jazz saxophonist alive - is reluctant to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, although his overall view of life with music is closely related.
At the age of 80, I felt that the best thing to do was to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things change," Shorter claims.
How the Insects of Thailand Picked Up Paris Bar Sales
You may be squirming at the insect, but you have no idea that you will eat it for about half a kilogram a year.
For example, it's spread out in the flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience.
The offer of insects was first placed in Paris on the menu of his company at the beginning of October Eli Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in a fashion 18th district near Montmartru, visited by a large tourist.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and shrimp eggs, guests can eat not only different larvae, locusts or water bugs, but also the scissors can be tasted.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that the insect does not damage its wings, do not distort its legs or damage its eyes) Daviron is sent all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, and elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneer menu lists a number of reasons why it is necessary to consume insects.
The first of these is the environmental benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Davirron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant a pleasure, a feeling of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would have been impressed by the idea of eating a bug decorated with fist, but the reactions of customers of the Paris bar to serviced insects are very positive according to the owner.
Even the skeptics say they'll finally taste, even if they start with the smallest bits, and eventually they'll choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matááš: The new green economy should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been facing a steady decline in the volume of contracts and the state has not been interested in solving the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will save significant amounts for heating, but also for construction companies and construction materials manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, the country has significant leverage and multiplier effects, and it is also one of the most important growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the government's resolution and asks for such steps as would allow for further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be expressed within the framework of it.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
The dog took a rug, the president buried it, and he ended up with a bereavement.
President Milos Zeman left the Motola hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed, and went to a castle in Láné.
What's his medical condition?
In an unprecedented confession John Kerry said that American espionage “went too far”
John Kerry suggested a reduction in the U.S. defence stance on his tracking programs, and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases spying “went too far. ”
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as an “autopilot ” in view of the destruction of the NSA’s espionage that had emerged thanks to the informant Edward Snowden.
The published information sparked a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through a video link to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have actually learned about some things that have been done out of perseverance, because this possibility was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of cold war and then, of course, September 11th.”
So he became the first high - ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain it to people and clarify it and is already doing a thorough examination so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA was working for the good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we prevented planes from falling down, buildings from blowing up, and people from being executed because we already know about these plans ahead.
The chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad concerning alleged US espionage and convinced Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others and that he is concerned about their threat, that he will stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because they are disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the US's national security interests, it is really important for Europe to stay on one ship with us, in view of the joint effort to combat terrorism, said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at NSA programmes.
The media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe violated relations with some American allies, although the agency's chief said this week they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings about the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted Snowden as saying that the NSA was monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper has defended the Allies as necessary and said it is a common matter on both sides.
In the middle of a rumor, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and he hoped that members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators intending to participate are to be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the aim of the trip was to help fix relationships, he added that “well - meant educational measures ” would be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programmes they have been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programmes to better protect Europeans' rights, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones who are spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is planning this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the hatred that the American strategy has already triggered in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
Australia appealed against Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15-day prison on Phuket Island, who falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally indicted by an earthly court on Phuket Island on a false charge when the Thai police told her that the taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, the record from industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police from Phuket Island interviewed Bamford for two days before she found out she had made up an accident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention facility in Phuket County instead of being put in jail for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter asked for help from the Foreign Ministry in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns ” about their daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail for 50,000 Baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime she spent her vacation in the recreational area of Krabi in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in her being put in jail for adults.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith's travel agency in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a dismal picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
The Jag joked, "Gossip from the brejk?"
In the defensive zone, he won a regiment, and no one ever caught him again.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick forhend call.
Jaromír Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night 119th goal in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Svobod called the director of the Czech Roads and asked him if I would not be interested in advertising on their most modern train Pendolino!" he wrote on the introduction with an overhead Jag.
I hear we're kind of alike.
I guess I'll just have to finish my night practice so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might then call and he would like to make an ad for jets!" he added.
In addition, New Jersey has won the second victory in a row.
"And above all, you have noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrov takes place," Jagre said.
Place of option candle goulash
October's election rather than the winners brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that have not even reached the House of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and ultimately the CzechSSD because of their internal divisions.
The politicians, instead of the Christmas candles, served us electoral stew for the weekend.
Andrey Babish’s movement, which promised to change the current political style of government, was a leap of opportunity.
The fragmentation of the election result and the division on the winning side is recorded by the political (for the sake of President Milos Zeman) regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not support the party that President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the parliamentary House.
Although the president lost strategic momentum in front of other politicians because of the unpleasant event, he still has several ways to get it back - for example by selecting a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD is getting a prime minister's chair in my eyes, entrepreneurs are approaching Andrej Babiš.
Although the election development is so far a mile away from the fast and smooth creation of a stable government, compared to the election scenario of the left-wing government of ČSSD supported by communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is only a better report.
Given the loud resistance of YES to be put together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL coalition (total 111 Members).
In view of the split in the Czech Republic, which has thus become an insensitive and weak negotiating partner, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite challenging for the Czech Republic.
The minority government of the Czech Republic, composed of "non-aliens" in the Castle, probably won't pass.
In addition, any government in which the Czech Republic will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which can lead to a further division in the party sooner or later.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to make the next early election?"
More elections would be more like a referendum on the strength of the voting mandate of the YES movement.
ČSSD's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, to increase taxes on income or to build a state bank have fallen under the table.
On the contrary, the CSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Christmas parties agree, for example, on business support, a regular fiscal policy (a government deficit of less than 3% of GDP), on support for the employment of disadvantaged persons, a reduction in the VAT rate for the selected goods.
The third areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES, but now it has the top, so the program is still the most likely coalition of YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would rather be on the right side.
Which from my point of view is ultimately a better result than a left-wing tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
