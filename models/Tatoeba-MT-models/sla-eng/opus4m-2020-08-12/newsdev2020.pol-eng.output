Bosniaks protest Croatia's plans to store radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-west Bosnia in protest against neighbouring Croatia's plans to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Protesters in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad asked Croatia to abandon plans to build a landfill in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
Waste from the Krško nuclear power plant would be stored in the facility.
Bosniaks holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (a river) Una needs us" said that a landfill of radioactive waste could threaten the Union's rivers and the lives of about 250,000 people.
We have to say NO,
told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, Mayor of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the Krko power plant built in the 1980s also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are scheduled to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT reported on Friday that in Croatia it has not yet been decided whether to build a landfill on its own or to pay for the storage of parts of the waste in a new facility designed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister of Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country's ethnic division forced Croatia to find another location in a part of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why does Croatia claim that this is the best place in Bosnia?" Drljac asked.
We can't let them humiliate us!

The American Congress has agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The US Congress, 15 days after the approval by the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 MNEs, did not object to this transaction, which means that the latter condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After the approval of sales by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Defence Policy Adviser of the Washington-based conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Arms Export Control Act, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify the Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad for 15 days prior to the signing of the agreement, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of arms to a NATO member country, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the cost of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally finalised – will be the US Lockheed Martin Armament Company and its subcontractor will be the engine manufacturer of F-35A Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of U.S. fifth-generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were made in May by Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during President Andrzej Dude's meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalised, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon within the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland's tender was around $89.2 million, without weapons and technical assistance.
According to the PAP, the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity were informed that the price given in the initial negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices are dropping sharply, the price of one F-35 is now below $80 million, much less than Eurofighter, which does not have the advantages of F-35," Venable pointed out.
PAP spokesmen hoped that the final negotiations on the purchase of US warplanes by Poland would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – that is, offset – will be discussed directly with American F-35 hunter manufacturers.
What is Münchhausen's replacement team, referred to in the “Payton Hobart Elections” series on Netflix?
Caregivers and parents with this disorder pretend that their healthy child is sick.
The show “Payton Hobart's Elections” will hit the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first he has to become president of the student council at his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet seen the series, it addresses the topic of the replacement Münchhausen syndrome – a mental illness that occurs in caregivers who do so as if the healthy person they are dealing with has been affected by physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. the Munich syndrome, which involves causing symptoms of the disease.
Munchhausen's replacement team is to simulate that the person who remains under our care has certain ailments.
It is also called a fictional and induced disease, and is considered a child’s violence.
It is a rare disease that usually involves a parent who is extremely symptomatic or causing symptoms, so that it seems that his child is ill.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen’s replacement team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS notes the following examples:
Persuading medical personnel that a child who looks healthy does not feel well.
Imagining or inventing symptoms.
Counterfeiting the results of the child’s being considered sick, e.g. by administering glucose to urine samples, to make it appear that the child has diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often does the Münchhausen replacement team occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that 89 cases of this disorder occurred in more than two years in 100,000 people.
What should be done if a child is suspected of being in danger?
Contact the local branch of the special services or call the NSPCC Children's Protection website, choosing number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid on Kaduna school, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – The State Police Station in Kaduna raided Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal School yesterday, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Rigas, Igabi, and arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were under highly dehumanizing conditions.
A householder claiming to be Shehu, a school preacher, said: “They don’t tell the truth, because all the children were there for their parents ’ approval.
Before the children were admitted to school, the parents signed the form.
Parents brought food to their children every day and knew the conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as the removal of all the food provided by the parents before the school was closed.
It's not right because parents can testify that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the previous Abdurrahman Police Commissioner, who had once attended school to check the level of care for children, never had any reservations.
He claimed that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, a specialist at the Police Department for Public Relations, Yakubu Sabo, considered that after the transfer to the government, children would join their parents.
‘They were kept under dehumanising conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of the knowledge of the fundamentals.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
That is why we are studying the school to meet its owner," he added.
Foreign talent important for the development of China
Guangdong is a leader in the country in attracting foreign talent largely due to the Passport and Track Initiative (BRI), the Great Bay Area (GBA) Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.
The Nanfang Media Group conducted interviews in Guangdong with seven expatriates between the ages of 10 and 70.
From Singapore, Yash was born in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou and said he wanted to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and making a doctorate in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrow, a Russian student at Shenzhen MSU-BIT University of China, said: "Thanks to the BRI initiative, Russian students can study with Chinese students.
Together, we can create new concepts and new projects.
Rachel Rommeswinkel of the United States started a career in Dongguan as a blogger on beauty and has over a million fans in Bilbili and Weibo.
She said she would continue to share information on Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her videos.
Leticia de Lassus of France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, agrees that “education of children is like locking a jacket.
If you turn the first button wrong, the rest will never get to their right place.
The American of Chinese origin, Henry Xiao, believes that in the very centre of the GBA area, his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The manufacturer of the culinary program "Nanta Show" Sean Choi from South Korea said that the cuisine of the Guangdong region was known worldwide and the introduction of the "Nanta Show" in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Mojler, a Swiss technical director at Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality is based on the proper performance of simple work.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products and persistently strive for more and better results.

After disclosure of the material, Banas announced that on 27 September he would be able to make a free vacation until the end of the verification of his assets by the CBA.
The Kantar phone survey was carried out on 25-26 September 2019 on a nationwide representative sample of 1005 people over 18 years of age.
The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.

Semoniak: Tusk or Kidava-Błońska will be president
"I think Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidaw-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," says Tomasz Simeoniak.
Deputy Chief of the National Platform Tomasz Simeoniak spoke to Polsat News about the affair with the NI chief.
"This case is disqualified for Marian Banassi.
He can become the Minister of Culture for some entertainment, not the Chief of NI or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who's responsible for billions, taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Semoniak also spoke about Claudia Jachira's candidate.
"Antoni Matierewicz is on the PiS lists.
A man who didn't just say things, he did them.
He judged former SKW chiefs for spying on Russia, ruined their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone call for Antony Matierevitch not to be on the list?" he asked.
"People younger than us have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who's already apologized for one of the things, feels like she's overreacting sometimes.
Let's not make this a campaign issue," he added.
Tourists after the crash of the travel agency Neckermann Poland plan to return to the country
According to the Authority, it was not necessary to bring tourists before the time.
"The Authority is successfully paying unpaid hotel seats from the insurance guarantee," said the Commission.
On 25 September, the travel agency Neckermann Poland submitted a statement of insolvency at the marshal's office.
At the time the office filed a statement of insolvency, there were 3,600 tourists outside the country.
On Wednesday, about 500 people returned to Poland and on Thursday 230.
The next 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece are due back on Friday.
Tourists will come to Katowice and Warsaw (in total it will be five charter flights).
Some of them will return by flight.
On the weekend – as planned – about 1,000 tourists should return to the country, including Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy.
According to information provided by the Office of the Marshallian Region of Mazowiecki, the travel agency sold about 20,000 trips for the autumn and winter season.
"These customers of the travel agency should contact the insurance company Allianz Partners directly," the office recalled.
He also added that "the situation of tourists who have signalled problems in hotels at this time seems to be stable and the emerging incidents of interviewing tourists from hotels have been settled together with consular services".
Last Friday, the biggest authorities, and Thomas Cook's oldest travel agency, reported that it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100 percent of shares in Neckermann Poland.
"Ominous" masked rapist of Central Coast children forced to look at their victim in court
Dressed in disguise, the man grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to school and dragged her into a dense growth in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers detained a number of relevant subjects.
The man pleaded guilty to seven assault-related charges and to three more charges of sexual harassment and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim followed the path, and when she looked behind her, she saw him suddenly come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she pleaded “stop, stop, stop, stop, ” he grabbed her by the neck and forced her into adulthood.
The man said: “Silence, do not shout.
Don't yell, or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable straps, then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut it off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9:30, not answering several texts and calls from colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and he carried traces of grass and wood, and he himself claimed that he was involved in an attack of rage on the road during which he chased another driver into the bushes and fell off the embankment.
The ongoing trial of the convict man will take place on Tuesday.
The pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the benefit of the common good.
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race for the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of achievement in the digital field poses a risk of increasing social inequalities if it does not take into account the common good from an ethical point of view.
Pope Francis spoke these words during a conference in the Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered at the conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in a debate on the prospects and threats associated with artificial intelligence.
Technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work have been discussed, with machines playing an increasingly important role, as well as a study of the case of the Christchurch assassination in New Zealand and the decisions taken by companies that own social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he cautioned that increasing dependence on work equipment to achieve profits was a risk of depriving people of their dignity as a result of their work.
"If technological progress were to be the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological advancement of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an undesirable return to some kind of barbaricism dictated by the law of the strongest.
The conference organisers expressed their hope to benefit from the expertise of participants and to identify possible future Catholic Church advisers in matters related to high technology.
Martin Odegaard, a player borrowed from Real Madrid, makes fans euphoria his effective assistant.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assistant at Michael Oyarzabal's opening goal.
Winning 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed to the top of the La League table and continues to pass being invincible on its own field this year.
However, despite the absence of any failure this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane is under enormous pressure due to a turbulent pre-seasonal and public argument with the Wall Star, Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the League of Champions by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents – some of them the French currently have plans, others not.
Vinícius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the team.
However, this Norwegian young player, Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, caused a huge movement, including an incredible assistant in the La League match.
During the meeting of Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Michael Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad finally won 3-0 in front of his own audience.
After taking the ball from the right, Martin Odegaard maneuvered the player from the opposite team, setting up a net for him, and then sent an amazing shot to the centimeters between the other two players and his teammate just to deliver the leg.
The second gate of Willian Jose and the third in the performance of the incredible Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty, provided a decisive victory for Imanol before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but he had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, a Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of the name of Sharad Pawar on fraud concerning the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra
Anna Hazare said: “The name of Sharad Pawar was not visible on the list when I was given the case.”
The social actor, Anna Hazare, was not surprised by the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar, the chairman of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with the multimillion-dollar fraud at the State Bank of Maharasztra.
The investigating agency of the Executive Directorate, in short ED, filed a case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar, former Deputy Chief Minister of State of Maharashtra, and other persons involved in fraud.
The information report of the Executive Directorate on the case, equivalent to the FIR police report, was submitted by the Central Agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on the report of the FIR of the Mumbai Police, which lists the names of the bank’s former president, Ajita Pawara, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, the name of Sharad Pawar was nowhere to be seen.
"How his name came to be, who gave it, only they know these things," Anna Hazare said Thursday when he was asked about the ED case and the alleged connection between Sharad Pawar and fraud.
Anna Hazare, critical of Sharad Pawar, expressed the hope that the truth would come out as a result of ED's detailed investigation into fraud.
"ED will find out where his name came from," said Anna Hazare, a frequent participant in the anti-corruption event.
Sharad Pawar denies that he committed a criminal act and argues that he was not connected in any way to the bank, and also questions the fact that the case was filed several weeks before the October 21st elections of the Maharasht Assembly.
The former Minister of the Union has ensured that he will not give in to the Majestic Delhi, clearly referring to the central government of the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Directorate as motivated by political considerations.
It's a busy day for SG.

A 41-year-old Ukrainian bus was carrying elements of bodywork from an exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were mechanically removed.
The body parts worth about 15,000 zlotys have been stopped.

Mylan agrees to pay $30 million under the EpiPen Agreement.

The Securities and Exchange Committee said on Friday that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen as a “generic” medicine in the program of return for Medicaid.

Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, death of a child.
They're dramas that cause great suffering and they're hard to understand.
We're asking, "Why?"
At times, we also hear that “God wanted us to. ”
Is it the Creator who sends us misery and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujic was born 36 years ago, his father ran out of the room with horror.
“My son has no arms or legs!” he shouted to the doctor.
Their parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick’s mother felt that God had a plan for their children.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujic is a world - famous evangelizer and motivational speaker, which brings many people back.
"I am proof that God is never wrong," he stressed.
"When suffering touches us, it is hard to understand.
We're looking for reasons.
We ask, "Why did this happen to us?"
If we believe that God rules over the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises as to whether He has sent a disease upon us, a misfortune...".
Mother admits to murdering two teenage sons
The woman burst out crying when she was told that she could spend the rest of her life in prison after confessing to murdering two of her teenage sons and planning to kill the other four of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35 years old, confessed to the murder of Tristan Barrass (13 years old) and Blake Barrass (14 years old).
The death of the brothers occurred at a hospital 12 minutes apart after the police were called to the Shiregreen district of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on May 24 at 7:30.

PO Ambassador Krzysztof Breyza sues Caesar Goose
"In connection with the campaign of lies of Piszowska TV, I am suing Caesar Gmyz," said Mr Po Krzysztof Brejz on Twitter.

One of the leading leaders of SokomzBurak is Krzysztof Breyza, who has great experience in organizing the hate department.
"Those who know Marcia Kozak-Zhozda perfectly – the founder of the 'Heiter' profile – are Kirwiński, Budka and Giertych," Gmyz said.
SokzBuraka are pages and social profiles with policy-related mems and jokes.
According to “Networks”, the PR-Oceans Mariusz Kozak-Znowda is behind this profile.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisory authority in connection with a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC Police Procedure Office will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister of the investigation as to whether, in the course of the conduct of the public office as mayor of London, he has abused criminal offences.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in its statement that its Supervisory Inspector had registered a "question related to the proceedings" of the Prime Minister in connection with allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from their combined close knowledge.
"The question of the procedure" can be said when information indicates the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
Doesn't mean it's somehow proven.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this case.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
It was transferred to this police supervisory authority because Johnson held a position at the time equivalent to that of the Police Commissioner and the Commissioner for Criminal Affairs.
Johnson denied that his close relationship with Arcuri would lead to any irregularities.
Earlier, he said that he would follow the orders of the London City Council and give details of his relations with Arcuri, but insisted that the Council "focused on the wrong problem".
The warrant follows the report of The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions headed by the then mayor of Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to Arcuri, which belongs to Hacker House.
The government is facing challenging questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds are granted.
Minister of Digitalization Matt Warman told the Municipal Chamber that his department's employees "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were sent to the California office, where 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
A close relationship between the prime minister and the businesswoman "was the secret of polyszynel for the staff".
The GLA decision to refer the matter to the independent IOPC Police Procedure Office met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the senior government representative's environment, it is a "politically motivated attack", and its deadline, on the eve of the Maintenance Party conference, is "publicly political".
"The supervisor did not provide any evidence to support the charges and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to give him an answer before the press release was announced late Friday night," the source claims.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to rely on such a public policy code.
Today, in earlier hours, journalists "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businesswoman, assisted by a tourism and promotion agency in London, was "the secret of polyszynel" for employees.
The senior officials of the London & Partners (L&P) agency recalled that Arcuri had received seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor despite the fact that its companies were not then considered "reliable".
Third accused of drug crimes in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – In connection with last year's death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid responsible for the “epidaemia” that absorbed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit was getting drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, is suspected of serving as Walter’s “courier, ” who supplied the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly charged with causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in his case.
Walter is under probation for the 2005 drug case and has already been sentenced to five months for violating the conditions of release.
Prosecutors in charge of the case, which was first reported on Thursday by the TMZ celebrity website, demand that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the defendant's escape.
The reply to a message left on his lawyer's answering machine did not come immediately.
Pettit was indicted in a federal court on September 4th, and his lawyer refused to comment.
The words of Miller's rhymed songs are a frank conversation about his depression and drug use, so he got fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh, Miller, who was actually called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained in connection with a singer named Ariana Grande, who had been finished earlier in 2018.
After his death on the Instagram portal, she published a moving film with Miller and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentioned him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the 3 Doors Down Group, also died as a result of an overdose in 2016 and found in his body the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This article amended: the correct spelling of Walter’s name is Stephen, not Stephen.
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games for mobile devices
A 9-year-old creates a game of hide-and-seek game using a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices using it.
In today's game, there's a bat who's hiding under the program.
The player gets the point every time he catches a bat coming out of the hideout.
I learned to create games on an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad enrolled him for a five - day accelerated course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organised by Codefest International, was intended to provide children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When I was four, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed a phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil’s interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and received a storm for spending all his time playing games.
“One day he played on the tablet as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was nervous, ” he said.
Out of anger, I said, “You're still playing, can't you think about creating your own games so that others can play them? ”
Speaking these words, I was nervous and I didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown active interest in the science of creating his own games, encouraging his parents to buy a laptop and write it on a course during which he learned the basis of game creation.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives its thunders titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google Play Store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were celebrated for using codes to create robots that divide their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from Ghana High School won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for boxing.
And thanks to the increasing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on track to a career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina confesses to lying about corruption
On Friday, the court documents show that the former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political contributor.
According to Robin Hayes, she's about to plead guilty next Wednesday.
The document containing the factual basis prepared under the Defence Agreement signed by Mr Hayes shows that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been sealed and there is no factual basis for the allegations that Hayes will make.
Initially, he was accused of conspiracy, corruption, and false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the insurance company's plan to direct taxes to the main market regulator in the country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates were accused of trying to bribe the state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindbergh is the founder of an insurance and investment company, one of the major state-owned political donors in recent years, which has passed over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but he also gave donations to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday's e-mail requesting a comment.
Hayes's defender, Kearns Davis, did not respond to Friday's e-mail requesting a comment.
On Friday, the court documents show that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had not spoken to Causey about the employees of the State Insurance Department.
According to a document containing the factual basis, Hayes actually spoke to the Commissioner for Insurance about Lindberg's request to change the staff employed by the market regulator.
Prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg set up a meeting with Causey and that he was talking about a bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg called for special treatment of his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the Causeya campaign in 2020.
It follows from the indictment that the conspiracy also includes a request for a change of departmental officer who controlled Lindberga.
Former Republican Causey reported an alleged attempt on corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with anything.
According to the indictment, Lindbergh's partner ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causeya campaign during a conversation in which Lindbergh and Causey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, arguing that the transfer of this amount of money would attract attention, but, according to the indictment, he finally withdrew.
"Whatever you all want to do, this is what we will do," said Hayes according to the indictment.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to an e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.
Drivers will take the first part of the new burial
From Saturday, drivers will be able to use the first of the three built mountain sections of the S7 expressway, the new Zakopianka – from Skomělní White to Rabka Source and the further biroad of the main road accelerated to Chabovka.

Our goal is a state of prosperity
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland," said Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to get a vote on Councilman Dariusz Matecki, a candidate for the Fair from the List of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the state of prosperity," the minister said.
"We want the Poles to make much better money so that their lives are on a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a programme that committed itself to four years ago.
We said we'd introduce the 500 plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kopcz said it was impossible, that the money was simply gone.
We proved that the money was and was, only PO didn't care about the ones they were going to hit."
Zíbro also reminded of the trip for children and the 13th pension – and that 14th pension is also planned.
In addition to the "smart division of national income", the PIS priorities are a fair state and economic development.
The money should not only reach the pockets of the chosen, who have good relations with the establishment and the power, but should reach the entire society evenly,” the politician said.

Part of Sopockie Street in Lowland after the expansion
On Tuesday, 24 September, the extended Sopocka street in Niske was dedicated to operation.
The total value of this task was a million 803 000 zlotys, of which a million 26 000 zlotys were funded by the FDS, while the remaining amount was the own contribution from the Niežan district and the municipality and the city of Low.

Facebook with self-awareness of users hides the fan counter for a sample
As part of the first experiment in the world, aimed at improving the self-esteem of users, some people using Facebook will soon not see a fan, reaction and video screen under the posts of others.
Likenesses will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
A new Facebook version launched in the next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of a self-esteem study and mental health experts' opinion indicating that the fan counter might lead to comparisons.
"The response of many groups working with us to combat harassment, as well as mental health organisations, was really positive," Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will help people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of likes or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and not considered competitive – she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies that are based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they have previously had access to.
She stated that it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram, when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment will end and whether the change will be permanently implemented.
"The initial comments by users on the new rules in place on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinion," she said.
Speaking of the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically knowledgeable Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with reliable opinions on whether new experience is valuable for people using our services or not.
Czestochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims from hens
Częstochowa kura does not comment on the Council's appeal to the then metropolyta abpa Waclawa Depo for the transfer of financial compensation for waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city's asking for £1 from the pilgrim.
He spoke on Friday at a press conference with the participation of, among others, the leader of the Spring of Robert Biedron, who was organized to lead the Czesna Gora Czastochowa alley of the Holy Mary of the Virgin, the vice-president of the town council and the candidate for the Lukasz Kot Sejm.
Kot reported that the day before the local councillors of the SLD had voted in favour of the abpa Waclaw Depo for the transfer of the city of one gold from each visitor of the Czestochowa pilgrim – to support the work of the city services, municipal services, etc.
We accepted an appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean up the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
"We ask for the transfer to the budget of the city of symbolic gold from each pilgrim.
This will enable the city to provide them with better conditions for their stay in Czestochowa," the vice-president of the city council said.
Mr. Mariusz Bakalarz, the spokesman for the Czestochowa Metropolitan Curia, initially prepared a multi-faceted reply, but then asked, as he called, for instructions from Mr. Depo, to replace it with information on the content: “We do not refer to the case until we receive the official position of the City Council.”
According to a project posted on the website of the Czestochowa Magistrate's Office, the appeal to the Abpa Depo relates to the ‘transfer of financial compensation to the city of Czestochowa for the maintenance of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season’.
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims coming to Czestochowa and the rising costs of managing the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, given the image of the city among the residents and residents, pilgrims and pilgrims, we want to offer participation in the costs of the service of the waste system, within the generally accepted canons of care for our common good, the small country of Czestochowa," is a fragment of the appeal.
"Desiring to maintain the cleanliness of pedestrian-driving streams, which are moved by pilgrims, using a small infrastructure, i.e. external waste bins, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 per pilgrim", wrote.
"In addition to the participation in the annual costs that the city will cover from its own resources, ensuring the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and also stressing that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be allocated to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of publicly available public toilets," the Council said.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial issues, their proposal stems from the numerous reservations raised by residents regarding the state of purity of the routes to which pilgrims are travelling.
"In view of the care for the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of the City of Czestochowa calls on the Archbishop of Metropolitanity of Czestochowa Vaclav Depo to provide financial compensation for the city of Czestochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," the appeal reiterated.
According to the press office of Jasna Gora, there were 834 thousand people in 200 nationwide pilgrimages to this sanctuary throughout the year.
About 124 thousand faithful people arrived in 255 pilgrimages on foot.
More than 8.8 thousand people came to Czestochowa in bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in racing pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the horse sanctuary and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups, on roller skates.
"News" TVP missed the Confederation when describing the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the PIS Fair, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
Even on the “Super Express” portal, for which a probe was performed, is overstepping the electoral threshold.
The main edition of "News", describing the same survey, presented the results of only four first parties, completely missing the Confederacy.
The leader, Edith Lewandowska, made it clear that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and would have entered the Fair.
The TVP also showed the distribution of the fair terms without taking into account the votes cast on the Confederation.
It would give PIS independent governments.
Krzysztof Bosak spoke in a comment on the whole situation about "public compromise on integrity to society".
"They started with slogans about the 'moral revolution'," he recalled and said that the case was a sign of a feeling of weakness.
Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "TVP News" in further actions against the Confederacy shame Urban and Michnik.
He also drew attention to the lack of right-wing journalists.
"But let us also look at those who are allowing silence.
The "rights", the "independents", the "unruly".
In a few years they became a more primitive version of everything they said they were fighting," he added.
Małgorzata Motylow Vice-President NI
On Thursday 26 September, Marshal Elżbieta Witek handed over Małgorzata Motylow's application for the post of Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Chamber on 27 September 2019.

The new vice president of NI Malgorzata Motylow comes from Chelm Lubelski.
Brother sentenced to life for the murder of honorary media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos published on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
On Friday, the brother of the Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life imprisonment as the most notorious "honour killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – good in accordance with Western standards, but strongly misogynistic in Pakistan – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he told the press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and said that he had "evidently" murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "unacceptable".
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, handed over to the AFP that the court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in the long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God wills) will be acquitted by the higher court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He's innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder took place at the head of the world's information services and renewed calls for action against the so-called honour killing epidemic, in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, strangled, shot or squandered for such crimes as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing shame to their family by manifesting their own sexuality.
Killings are usually committed by a close relative.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (revenge) can ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, Parliament adopted new legislation imposing a life sentence for honour killings.
However, whether a murder will be considered an honorable crime remains the responsibility of the judge, which means that murderers can theoretically invoke another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially urged their sons to show no mercy.
However, the disgruntled feel that they may also lose him, change their minds, and claim to want his forgiveness.
The international outrage caused by the murder led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself heir with its parents, thus forcing the matter to move forward.
One of the more famous achievements of Baloch is the offer of stripping before the Pakistani cricket team and the establishment of a decomposed purple dress in Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, viewed her as a breaking restriction in a country where posing as a role model for Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen women's positions.
The roots of the "honorous" killing lie in tribal social standards that continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular regulate the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN said that the increasing violence has caused a doubling of the number of people displaced from North-West Nigeria to around 40,000 in the last four months.
The UN Refugee Agency stated that the concerns created a "new humanitarian emergency" requiring an interagency effort to raise $35.5 million in new funds by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamist group of Boko Haram, which has been in the north of the country for decades, has not been responsible for the latest attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of organized armed groups.
"It paints a terrifying picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy houses and steal cattle.
An army and police were sent to combat gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is being pulled away from the fight against Boko Haram and the Islamic State branch in West Africa, which separated from its former grouping in 2016.
"Refugees do not come with names of groups," he said.
They're coming for it with horrible stories.
In most cases, refugees join the neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said he expected more people to flee to Niger in the coming months along with the deteriorating security situation, particularly in the Sokoto state.
A new date has been set for the man accused of killing a woman and 2 children
A new trial date has been scheduled for the Guatemalan man accused of killing Iowa’s apartment and her two children.
According to the Act of the District Court in Polk County, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders, according to the authorities, with a false name originally given to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
It follows from the judicial acts that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give both parties more time to prepare.
Immigration and Customs officials say that Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
“The Sun”: Boris Johnson in the face of the rebellion of a cabinet seeking to reduce its demands for brexito and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Only three weeks before the EU's final summit among the most important people in the country, the prime minister fears that he will not have enough time to make more important concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of mutiny by a cabinet seeking to lower its demands for brexity and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The negotiations included an impassion on a new customs system to replace the backstopping mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has set out proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "implementable".
The Ministers of the Crown expect the EU's decision-makers, headed by German chief Angela Merkel, to offer at the last minute a compromise to the critical leader in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstopping mechanism.
Journalists of The Sun spoke to three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the prime minister after the annual meeting of the marches next week in Manchester.
They will ask the Prime Minister for a "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser, Dominik Cummings, to try to use a bluff against the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then accept the offer made at the last minute by the Union.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the ruling of the Supreme Court as "a warning signal" on Tuesday to end Parliament's suspension and added: "The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of an agreement.
We will never defeat the arithmetic in the House of the Municipals, which is working for our detriment.
The Prime Minister must bend now and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay off: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned down on the ground.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The Second Minister of the Cabinet has committed himself to hand Johnson over to try to push the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else doesn't work out.
The minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to resubmit the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the House. ”
There are opportunities to vote on it, and everyone really cares about the end of the subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a ludicrous speech, the former prime minister said on behalf of the Toris: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants a deal with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he struggles with the bulls in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales and fights with the citizens on the main streets of the cities – everything in the eyes of the world, as if the electoral campaign had already lasted well."
The current prime minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still distant, and added: “No one should be deceived: to secure an agreement is a very long way to go.”
However, the spokesman also said that the Benna Act, which implements the three-month suspension of brexit in the absence of an agreement, "extensively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the prime minister, along with his colleagues, is still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Brix Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more talks will take place with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how the zone for all of Ireland works for food and mercury.
A dog with no nose and legs is picking up Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect.
Kundelek was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, it has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
A picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal from the first look.
"At first I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided to take care of her bitch until someone adopted her.
Still no one was reporting.
"The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
On Instagram, she's been watched by over 14,000 interns.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a glasgow accent I would never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV chiefs said that because of Glasgow's accent, "he'll never make a career" as a presenter.
Referring to her 35-year career in the television industry Kelly, 59 years old, admitted that before the first performance on the screen she felt "great nervousness".
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I was working at BBC Scotland as a specialist in information search and testing, my boss said that because of my accent with Glasgow, I would never succeed in television.
I went to London to get to know the whole TV band and watch the show before I took over at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget an interview with a Bette Davis star by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish television correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Cybride, Scotland.
Then she started running such programs as “GMTV”, “ITV Breakfast” and “Daybreak” to later launch her morning program “Lorraine”, which he named after her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will be celebrated by a special program during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret to her long internship on television is “passion and enthusiasm” and “interest”, adding: “We have to work hard.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interesting and interesting.
When she mentions the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly says that "very difficult" was for her to report on the Dunblane assassination.
I had no idea that many families of killed or injured children were watching our live program with Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for hours at her house.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, and I've been involved.
She added that "extremely difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCanni shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "really admires their strength and courage".
They must cope with the pain because they do not know what happened to their beloved daughter and, in addition, bear the most terrible comments of the online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The program for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, September 30th at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga Fears Prisons
A senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga had rejected the offer to take over the office of President Robert Mugabe at the top of the coup because he feared imprisonment in order to confirm the military's takeover in November 2017.
As reported last week by The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwenge to take over the presidency during negotiations with the military during the coup.
However, a senior public official announced in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer out of fear, but because he had examined Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the coup.
In addition to the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over power to Vice-President Chiwenga and not to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwand 2, whose officials confirmed to the State that he was a senior official at the Bureau of the President and Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there were intensive negotiations on the matter at that time.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that the power was slipping out of his hands.
Mediation between the military authorities and the late former president was three stages, according to a senior state official.
The official claimed that among the negotiators was President George Charamba's spokesman, then the head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and the clergy representative of the Roman bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-person mission to hand over the offer to the President of Chiwenga, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defense Force (SOZ).
A man who was even more regarded as an icon of Africa after his death in vain as trying to condemn military action from the UA, trying to induce other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) Chiwenga was not based on a choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took on a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the dead family," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation by which the dead wanted to reverse the situation in a totally non-diplomatic way.
It should be recalled that the commanders have stated that they did not overthrow or overthrow the constitutional order, which would be the reason for their conflict with the UA position on coups.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, abruptly interrupting the leaders’ claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, by the way, was still highly confused with the whole situation and the way it fit into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would have no choice but to describe it as a coup, so the call for military intervention would be credible.
It is in that spirit and with such calculation that this offer has been made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made that move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the emperor that he was risking a lynching like Gaddafi.
The army chiefs told him they wouldn't turn their guns against the citizens if they went to his residence Blue Roof.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, i.e. to save his family and prove that the army took power," the official added.
Early SSOs and commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The messenger (Gono) carrying this desperate message was given to understand – by means of a powerful metaphor – that isu thyri vemakwapa-makwapa (we are part of the camouflage section, i.e. the military), we are not politicians, nor are we competing with each other at political level, argued a higher rank as a public official.
Officials tell the state that the military has notified the military commanders in the region through the attack, who were in Zimbabwe, that they are not going to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try again Manangagwa to return from a short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about a coup d'état.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of South Africa, who were a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because Jacob Zuma was then president of Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the army came to Mugabe's house, as it had repeatedly feared in the background, South African troops would immediately appear in Harare.
"This did not work because Putin and African leaders did not choose this route," said one informant, "the Independent."
China needs strong leadership or will "disintegrate" as stated in the policy paper
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will "disintegrate" – the government said in a policy paper issued Friday on the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The press office of the Chinese government reported in the White Paper that the success of the country since the Communists took power 70 years ago has led the party.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, and the difficulties of administration are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without China's uniform and strong leadership, they will move towards divisions and decay, which will be catastrophic for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used hard-handed policy to address the problem, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who holds the lead of the second world economy anniversary on Tuesday, has further tightened the party's governments and imposed sanctions on those who may challenge the authorities since the office was taken over at the end of 2012.
Xi also supervises the military modernisation programme, which has driven the region off balance.
The document found that China was not trying to export its development model or to import any foreign models, seeking only peace rather than “hegemony”.
The Chinese do not have in their genes the conquest of other nations or the domination of the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and unrest have left a deep mark on them as a result of suffering; China will never inflict on others the suffering it has suffered.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country involved in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing down economy, as well as anti-government protests in China's subordinate Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never “trade” its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, D.C., the document stated that "the dangers of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "trade wars will never weaken it".
China is confident that they are able to face challenges, the crisis to turn into new opportunities and to open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should take a rational look at the development of China, because China does not intend to challenge the positions of the United States, nor do they want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely to stop China's development.
Reducing and weakening other countries and transferring national misunderstandings abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
The world of Jack Palkiewicz: Dubai, real face
The Dubai Emirate is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progressiveism.
This defining new trends of world tourism leaders stimulates imagination and desire, flattering the emptiness of rich snobbery hotels and attracting the sought after fortunes of investors and traders in tax haven status.
Websites infect the city with enthusiasm of dreams, an exciting temple of luxury and a concentration of 21st century architecture in one.
They rose on the oil-rich emirates to become the Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many admire the pervasive splendor here, appreciate the creative hyperactivity and the hysterical pursuit of vanguardism.
Here is the city whose motto says everything: “Surprise, dazzle, and charm.”
And almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the vastness and contradiction of the metropolis took on the dimension of a delicate grotesque. ”
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Record Book, an informal constitution of the Emirate.
Because everything here has to be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something that in the old Europe may be less transparent but important for quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like they're in their own home.
And not in Dubai.
Running away from the world of magic, I ripped off his golden mask, revealing the second face of an artificial paradise.
He's gonna count, which he's not talking about loudly, and he's not writing.
I show the misery of the Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale conditions of the divine ethnic caste of the Dubains, the grandchildren of the unwritten Bedouins.
I'm going to extreme poverty, for example, to a ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where there's an army of Asian workers under harsh conditions.
It was in one generation that they built the desert sky of Manhattan under slavery.
They came here to visit with good wages and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and they had a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up in the air created by Dubai's myths.
The growing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labour increasingly difficult for the Emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned her home from talking about diets after her struggle with eating disorders.
Melanie Chisholm, of the Spice Girls team, admitted that there was a ban on diets in her home after she had dealt with eating disorders herself, eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
For years, Sports Spice had not grown fat and “obsessively practiced” as a result of the pressure associated with being a famous member of the world pop group, which later caused depression and malnutrition.
She now reveals that her experiences influence the way she raises her daughter, Scarlet, and therefore “does not allow diets in her home. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the benefits of the experience of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak in it.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with Women's Health Mel, who won fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before the social media was established, the “distorting” comments on the issue caused her complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain groups of food products, exercising myself more and more obsessively until I started to have a problem," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A Picture That Shakes the World
A Polish girl and an American documentary presented a witness to the world about the cruelty of war.
The legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen at the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm speaking from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!", began his radio performance documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September days of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship was echoed by a broad echo in the West.
Warsaw President Stefan Starzyński helped him first, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the U.S., deposited it in the embassy safe, and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he's been trying to be everywhere he's been.
Four hundred planes and artillery nearly stopped attacking the city.
Bryan perpetuated death, suffering, the struggle to survive in the city's jaws.
Just before the capitulation, he took the negatives out of the ocean with the embassy staff.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What has happened to Warsaw will come to Paris, London, and even New York”.
His shaking chronicles were seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They were making films that were glorising their knighthood.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Prosecution before jury against former sportsman accused of multiple rapes
The jury is facing a rape trial against a former baseball player at Delaware University who is charged with multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing the arguments, members of the jury proceeded to decide the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who turned 21 claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two meetings on the Bumble website and the man’s photo was sent to the woman, where he presented himself naked.
The woman is one of Conaway's six accused of sexual assault in 2013-2018.
According to the defendants, the hug that the woman had agreed to has been raped, which was what happened to her opposition.
Defenders refer to the conflicting relationship between women and memory gaps and claim that the woman was likely to regret the closeness of the intimate relationship.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bicycle for a million gold
The gold-covered bicycle worth a million gold could be seen at the 10th edition of the International Bike Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
It's an unusual vehicle printed on a 3-D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Danowicz, has just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
- The bike is covered with golden spray chrome, underneath it is the highest sample of silver.
It's an unusual coating made by my friend from Zor.
"There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could normally drive it.
It can grow at 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bicycle," his designer says.
‘The body of the bicycle was printed on 3D printer.
These are the sixes that make up the kind of faith.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a card and hid it deep in the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was created for three years," adds Adam Zdanovicz.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside are batteries, wires, elements that form a structure.
It is hidden under the body of 11 elements on the steel frame of the bicycle.
That's where the engine's hidden.
The steering wheel for this bike was set up a week before I left for the United States for the World Bike Show.
I couldn't decide exactly what this steering wheel was going to be.
It's part of the transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he sums it up.
The gold-covered bicycle was appreciated in Las Vegas by the most important competition category "Best Amazing Single custom copy".
The film material shows a strong contamination of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, the Port of Circular Quay, the amusement park Luna Park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge makes an important contribution of $21.9 billion, annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge lies the ugly truth.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, which is affected by annual pollution levels equal to about 15 Olympic swimming pools.
These fearsome statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions one of our most filthy aqueducts at the same time.
According to the new film material titled “Sydney Bay – Up and Down”, the waters in the area of Australia’s most popular city are full of napalms, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay with rainwaters.
However, most of the ingredients that choke our shipping channels are plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, in a video published on 27 September, with the publication of this film deliberately coincided with World Tourism Day.
This akwen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and polluted rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is transferred to our waterways, and most of it affects the bay through a storm drain.
"After so much rainfall the bay... it looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as in the case of an iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious under the water, as 70% of the plastic that reaches the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless time is spent underwater, you can't really realize what's in the deep there," said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, noting that he and his team pull about 500 kg of plastic out of the water each year.
I think if more people knew (what's under the water), they'd just be scared.
It's overwhelming... over half of what we find at the bottom are plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all that garbage is coming out of the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and CEO of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist – could help reduce the amount of plastic and the remains available for our waterways.
"This must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better manage the recovery of materials, and have a greater awareness of what we flush in the sewers that eventually reach the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're going to die because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our source of food.
But we can arrange this bay and restore it to its former greatness, and that's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the recycling company TOMRA as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of the beverage containers that often enter the environment coincides with the study on the relationship between plastic and mental health, which was published this month.
A new survey of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 found that 82% of respondents feel helpless to plastic waste and 25% of adults blame the problem of disposable plastic packaging waste.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth-largest concern of parents, and 93% of 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns about the quantity of plastic waste entering the oceans were increasing.
Many people who participated in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they simply did not know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Meme after the game netters in the semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had a lively audience on their part, which effectively deconcentrated Polish retinas.
There was also much controversy among the judges, who did not count on four reflections on the part of the hosts in one of the actions.
It was at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vitala Heynen's guardians had the chance to jump off rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles finally had to recognize the superiority of the rival, who, after winning 3:1, will play in the finals of the tournament.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support psychiatric hospital in Akra
Members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated 30,000 GH worth of food yesterday? A psychiatric hospital in Akra during a short ceremony held in Akra.
This is part of the activities of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
Among the gifts included various food articles, fruits, soft drinks, teats, clothes, funerals, paradisaic bananas, maniocs and water bags.
During the visit, the group also spoke to several patients in the facility.
The event was attended by members of the management staff of Accra Markets Limited, the directors of the association and the queens of mothers.
In presenting the items, Ms Mercy Naa Afrowa Needjan, President of the Women's Association of the Market in the Great Akra region, announced that donation is part of the regular activity of the charity group under social responsibility.
She noted that support for the care of patients at the facility was necessary to show them love and to allow them to feel part of society.
Ms. Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow suit.
Taking gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the hospital director, praised the association for its support and promised it would be used well for the benefit of the patients.
She called on other organizations to support the hospital.
Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The national cloud operator, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region in Warsaw – a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by the Polish PKO Bank and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of the company.
The partnership between the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we outlined less than a year ago, announcing the appointment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – digitisation of the Polish economy and dynamization of its growth.
"Now Polish companies will get additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
By taking advantage of them, they are increasing their chances to advance to the world league, which is what we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining their group today significantly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagiello, President of the Polish Bank.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"The investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitalisation.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it," adds Paul Boris, President of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on a leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all the key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spencer, or BigQuery.
The integration of Google Cloud services into the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies as their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," noted Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends such as internet items (IoT), which repeatedly increase the need for computing power necessary to process huge data sets.
VI Pan-Polish Seniors' Parade
On the very afternoon of 24 August 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parade of Seniors "Admirable" and the Picnic Generation began, events organized by the Začin Foundation.
According to Premysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation: “The parade is a worldwide event.
She has already gone through the centre of Warsaw six times to manifest how large and diverse the community are.
Through the Parade, we fight against harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was staged by a special floor bus serving as a musical mobile scene, which traditionally featured the famous DJ Wika.
The participants in the joyous corrode, at the second known Warsaw and world breakthroughs, passed the Jerozolimsky Aleijas, Kručí to the Warsaw Uprisings Square, Mazowiecka Street to J. Pilsudski Square and Královska and Krakowski Predzděměměměměm at Kampus Main University of Warsaw.
During the march, which brought together several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colourful delegations were welcomed by the thanks of many gathered on the route of the march, Warsaw and tourists.
Two organized groups in company T-shirts of yellow and blue took part in the parade.
The first representative of the University of the Third Age and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animaters.
Within the campus, organizers have prepared, among other things, gastronomic stands and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering services and products to seniors to improve their daily lives and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Stylish Senior Voice stand by professional Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Pulled out, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
The stand also offered a workshop on the learning of moving around the scene and posing for pictures.
The ending was a fashion show of the Stylish Seniors.
At the stand of the General Polish Voice of Senior there was the latest edition of the letter and materials related to the campaign “Stop manipulation – Don’t buy at the presentation!”.
The next stands offered cosmetic, moving, plastic and artistic workshops.
Several studies could be carried out and specialists could be consulted on health and nutrition issues.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of: Helena Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Mariola Bojarska-Ferrenc, Tomasz Jacykov and Robert Janowski.
There was no lack of vocal and musical attractions on the picnic.
There was a legend of a Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and an intergenerational dance took place in the evening that led DJ Wik.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils can have the key to treating cancer – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way of masking some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in the Tasmanian devils and in humans.
It is hoped that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do the Tasmanian devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that may become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of deadly tumors within the face that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way of masking some cancer cells both in humans and in bags, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack cancer.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas, and a type of skin cancer called Merkl cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance, we can reverse this process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-inclusion of markers called MHC proteins, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
"It may have far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat the facial tumors of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process exists (for cancers in humans and in the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
"So far, it has been very difficult to cure the tumours of the Tasmanian devils.
But if human medicines can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, it is possible that this will help control the disease."
Scientists will be amazed by the fact that a very large planet orbits a really small star
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of a solar system 30 light years away from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet formation, as in this system a large planet similar to Jupiter orbits around a small star called the red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of a gas planet of the giant GJ 3512b orbiting the central star, a red dwarf, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, the stars are much bigger than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet differ slightly in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the sun, and the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, or the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Space Research Institute, which led the studies published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low-mass stars tend to become home stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a planet of a gas-like giant like Jupiter orbiting a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the complete circle lasts 204 days.
The red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the sun, but to some extent it is comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paleer than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheita / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," Morales said.
"There is evidence of the existence of another planet currently orbiting this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," Morales said.
Planets come from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star that the planets orbit.
According to the leading model of planet formation called the model of accretion, the object is originally made of solid particles in the disk, and the force of planet gravity in early stages of development allows the atmosphere to rise from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called the model of gravity instability.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than we expect and may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to disc stability and may result in more dense areas.
These masses can grow until they fall and form a planet.
Delicates worker accused of serving a bean dip co-worker containing methamphetamine
The sheriff's office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for serving a fellow bean dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of delivering methamphetamine and of causing the use of this substance controlled by another person, both crimes being second-degree offences.
The indictment was filed on the basis of an event of 9 September at the food shop Thrifway in Jefferson.
The 27-year-old suspect said to Deputy County Sheriff Marion that she saw Medina-Hernandez make a bean dip at lunchtime, which she then paid her.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she reported to the investigators, had never taken methamphetamine, said that “she thought that one piece she had eaten tasted strangely, but it did not arouse any suspicion. ”
When she got back to work, she felt she had a stomach disorder and couldn't get up on her feet.
According to the newspaper Albany Democratic-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was determined that the beans could contain methamphetamine.
According to police reports on The Smoking Gun, another employee of the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez “told her she would add drugs to her food”, while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message claiming that the meth had gone into the beansby by accident.
The OregonLive site reports on a recording of the monitoring of delicacies, which reportedly shows how back to the camera Medina-Hernandez pulls something out of the bra, stands behind the microwave and bends.
Next thing you know, he cleans his nose, he comes up to the table and he puts a bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled from the bra was also probably on the plate.
The Oregon newspaper Statesman-Journal states that the sheriff's office employees say there is no doubt that the clients are given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Prison, with a set bail of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police records indicate that a woman has already been convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illicit weapons.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": casting for Jamie New's role in the West End
Another great West End star is waiting for discovery, although she doesn't know it yet.
"Everybody's Talking About Jamie" music producers are looking for another Jamie New and are organizing open interviews.
Current star Layton Williams is going on tours in the United Kingdom, so the producers in his place are looking for "an exceptionally talented, undiscovered young performer".
The auditions in London will take place on October 10th in Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 beats of the song opening "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CV and portrait.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and in the following week, the producers will be invited back to the presentation.
The producer Nice Burns said: “We are happy to say that thanks to our fantastic audience, the musical will be played for the next, third year in Apollo. ”
We found some fantastic young performers who will join Layton Williams and Shane Richie during the tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical, we open up opportunities for unknown talents to join the current young professionals.
Williams, who took on Jamie New's role in February and replaced John McCree's original role, encouraged on Twitter "ALL Boys to send their tapes":
The tour will begin in February and the West End events will be extended until 29 August 2020.
The musical presents the fates of 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to prom at the end of school in a dress.
He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure he'll be a star.
With the help of the mother and the local community legend, Drag Loco Chanele begins to discover her identity, to oppose prejudice and a career in the light of the flash.
Music in this performance was written by Dan Gillespie Sells in an inspired BBC documentary entitled “Jamie. Drag Queen at 16” and by Tom MacRae in a book and lyrics.
Alpha Laval obtains an order in the natural gas industry worth 110 million SEK
Alpha Laval – the world leader in the field of heat, central separation and transport of liquids – has been commissioned to supply air coolers to the gas processing plant in the USA.

Marian Banas.
What's KAS doing about the N.I.C. boss?
The rental of real estate for an amount below the market price is an objection which arises in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
We asked the Treasury Office in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance about what the Treasury is doing in this regard.
Bertold Kittel in the report for "Superviser" TVN raised doubts about the statements made by the President of the Supreme Audit Chamber of Marian Banasia.
He's been researching the Central Anti-Corruption Office for several months.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In fact, he received 65,000 zlotys a year.
The report of the “Superviser” revealed that the hotel had been rented for hours.
The chief of NI explained later on state television why he only took over 5,000 zlotys a month for renting the property.
The newspaper Vyborcza, referring to the experts from the valuation of the property, estimated that it should be 15,000 zlotys per month.
“The amount was lower for a simple reason: I entered into a preliminary agreement and it was the fact that the tenant was going to buy this stone that led to me agreeing to a lower rent, that the remaining charges would be settled at the sale of the stone,” Banas said.
However, there has been doubts as to whether such a procedure does not constitute a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, press spokesman for the Treasury Office in Krakow, told TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"Any such questions please refer to the Minister of Finance," he added.
He explained that, in such cases, "the National Treasury Administration is in charge".
Press rapporteur Paul Jurek, Ministry of Finance, admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself is monitoring a number of cases that may raise reservations.
"The National Treasury Administration works in such a way that it has its own information and is based in a sense on the information that is available to the public.
On this basis, he decides whether to conduct any specific case or not," the MF explained.
"On the other hand, because we are all subject to a financial secret in the entire financial sector, we never speak out because we cannot speak in the individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed, asking about the Marian Banas case.
Finance Minister Jerzy Kwiecinski stressed that "the treasury offices do not report this type of news to the public".
"It is known that the entire treasure plant deals with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the royal family: surprise guests often flying a royal plane have been revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world throughout their lives.
This usually facilitates a royal plane – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world to important events and events.
It is not surprising that owning a plane involves privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues to pay, do not have any limits on the number of luggage and, it turns out, they can invite any guests – including really unusual ones – to board.
According to the recently premiered Channel 5 of the documentary, not only the queen and Prince Philip often travel on a royal plane.
During the program entitled “Secrets of Royal Flights,” the former Queen’s Flight Navigator revealed that furmen often flew with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes our very important royal guests could fly very important royal dogs. ”
It is not surprising that the queen may have wished her beloved loved ones to accompany her on her journeys, since she is known for her deep attachment to corgy dogs.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four-legged creatures and has heard that since the coronation she has owned more than 30 corgas.
It is said that in 2007 she had five courgettes: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spike and Span, as well as four dogs that are cross-sectioned with corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The Royal Air Force certainly had its hands full.
A royal house worker was seen taking out dogs and asking them to settle their needs before taking them on board the plane, says Shields.
I'm glad to say there's never been any incident.
The program also revealed the shocking number of luggage the queen takes on board during her journey in the performance of her duties.
The film’s narrator stated: “In 1953, the queen took a 12 - ton baggage on her 70,000 - km journey. ”
To be able to visualize it better, it's about as big as two giant elephants.
However, the queen is not the only person with a weakness for fashion.
It is said that Princess Cambridge also has her own preferences regarding the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that a separate seat is assigned to each of her dresses.
The new law enters into force.
In the event of an accident, the victim will receive a pension
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that the victims of the accident continue to pay their rent, according to the Financial Ombudsman.
It concerns the Act of 9 July 2019 on the specific rights of persons injured in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee amount established on the basis of the rules in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, there were definitely lower guaranteed amounts than at present, and in some cases the insurers had already stopped paying the rent.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been seeking for many years to create a mechanism that will allow seriously damaged persons to guarantee financial support from the communication OC or OC of the farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount," says Alexander Dashewski, legal adviser at the Financial Ombudsman's office.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because these are often very tragic situations for people in very poor health who, due to an accident, for example, cannot work and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental treatment for rehabilitation.
Some of them no longer received compensatory rents and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums in the OC policies.
Parts of it were threatened in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the limits of the insurer's liability were significantly lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of the exhaustion of the guarantee amount in previous years has most often affected those who have suffered damage in the 1990s.
At the time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions caused the increase in prices.
"We have also noted that this problem has also affected a number of mostly young people who have suffered damage at a time when the sum amounted to EUR 350 000 for each injured person.
Currently, it is €5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of casualties.
This is therefore a huge difference in relation to earlier periods, hence the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Alexander Dashewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee amount is increased every once in a while, the legislator accepted that the guarantee amount in force at the time of the application to the Remuneration Fund would be the upper limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund.
This rule shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not required to pay the pension on the basis of a judgment of a court establishing a guarantee amount other than that laid down in the OC insurance agreement.
This is the case in the case of an increase in the guarantee amount on a judicial basis under Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing obligation relationship.
"In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have asked us to intervene in the past.
We are informing them of new powers and, of course, we are ensuring that further support can be provided if any problems arise," says Alexander Dashewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off her boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend had shown her friends the sex tape that had been created in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old who is an architect from education explained to the court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her like a trophy, which can be praised in front of friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
Destroyed everything," she argued.
Cordoba's apartment has decided to pursue justice on its own.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him that she had prepared a special surprise.
With a velvet belt, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the secter and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was supposed to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled up my pants and grabbed my cell phone to call an ambulance," the injured man testified.
“I wanted to leave, but she began to insult me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing sex tape, she was not trying to escape responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said to the jury.
She was finally found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama State Congressman Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, retired congressman of the state of Alabama for the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family spokesman said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans in Alabama, in the Deep South, thanks to the fact that the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what kind of world he would like to leave to his great - grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like to return kindness.
"I hope that my grandchildren and my grandchildren will grow up in a country where the common debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will return to kindness," Edwards said, according to his family statement.
The state governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said Edwards served his post and his country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that the flag of Alabama's Capitol of State would be left to half the mast.
"He was the personification of a true civil servant and was the best husband of the state for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most famous politicians," said Ivey in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed great appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks patterns and makes our world better".
The Princess and Prince Harry, who is currently on a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Arch Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a youth meeting earlier this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
“I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @susexroyal, “a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better”, the first lady in her enthusiastic post wrote.
"Is it by meeting with Obama Foundation leaders @ObamaFoundation, whether by helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, it is an inspiration to many people," Obama added, adding a picture of a smiling Meghan sneezing with foundation leaders.
Megan interviewed Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, hosted by the former actress "Suits".
In an honest conversation, the first lady talked about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means leading to the art of forgiveness," she said in Obama's interview.
"Motherhood has taught me that for most of the time it is my job to give children space so that they can know the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are at heart with.
Obama, who from experience knows what the pressure of being on the candlestick is, shared with the princess’s advice during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure that you feel – imposed by yourself and by others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
"My advice is, therefore, to slow down and not to rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure that they were doing well at school and making new acquaintances before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think that's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains a permit for the sale of alcohol despite the owner's complaint
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Committee for the Control of Alcoholic Drinks in Washington has withdrawn a request to check that the local Trump International Hotel facility should lose its license to sell alcohol because of the owner's ability.
On Wednesday, the Agency ordered that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis be unfounded, since most of them do not live in or own property in the district.
“The Washington Post” states that for the second time these reasons are seeking to withdraw the hotel's liquor license, relying on the legislation in force in the district that says that applicants for a permit for the sale of alcohol must be “good”.
The original complaint filed last summer claimed that President Donald Trump was violating the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the licence.
“The Sun”: The crushing report considers the worst scandal of the Cleveland police force in Britain
The inspectors found the police to be the worst scandal in the UK.
In a crushing report, they assessed the work of the Cleveland police as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Majesty's Police Department, claims that the Cleveland police force had a "significant deterioration" of standards.
New appeals have emerged calling for a resolution of police services, which has led five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police have not tried to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weak.
Phil Gormley, of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspectorate of Police, said: “Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards. ”
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious", though undisclosed, charges concerning his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts has been suspended on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before the commission on offences for training female co-workers in sexual activities.
He's off duty.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the Toris said: “It is an official confirmation that these services are compromised.
Now it's time for the Home Office department to intervene."
Police chief Richard Lewis said: “After making improvements, I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces through changes. ”
We've got visualization of the skate park!
Will the young ones finally wait?
Older people are disturbed by young enthusiasts of riding on horseback and skateboards, and they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
For years, young people have been reminded of the place to ride roller skates, skateboards, hulaynogs, bicycles.
The subject is still coming back to our break.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
It's been loud about the absence of a skate park.
That's why we're going back to this and asking the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago, a woman who is disturbed by young people riding in the middle of the city was contacted.
"I am writing on behalf of the people of the block near Pilsudski to be interested in the situation of Olavska youth," writes the Malgorzat editorial.
"The bloc's residents called the City Guard repeatedly ineffectively.
I send photos to prove these everyday situations in addition."
We asked others about the matter.
Most have clearly stated that young people simply have nowhere to go in the city and have been in vain for years.
Even an avalanche of comments appeared under the Facebook post.
We already wrote in July that there is a chance that the skatepark will be built on the Olava City.
The mayor informed that the city had requested funding to build a skatepark.
‘The project consulted with young people, together with the permits, is ready.
On 28 March, an application was submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding of the task of "Budowska Skateparka in Olava" under the Polish Sports Programme, which we were told at the office.
Total project value: PLN 798 306,00.
Amount of funding requested: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we've asked again what stage the case is.
"We do not yet have information on the nature of the decisions made with regard to the request for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism," says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the European Fund UM Olav.
"It follows from the information received from the Ministry staff that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sports Programme should take place in October".
We also asked for a visualization of the Olavska skatepark.
We present it below.
Young people informed the editor that they would be collecting signatures on a petition for the construction of a skatepark in Olava on the next Saturday (September 28th).
"The rebellious young people saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a meeting," writes Santa.
The signatures on petition will be collected from 12.00 p.m. in the vicinity of Lidl Market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago.
It was one of the coolest competitions in the extra class.
The biggest legend was the memorable match of the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, the Legion took up a boat team at the old stadium in Lazienkowska in the last turn.
Both teams were dividing the point.
The masters had to win, the second in a row gave the Polish championship a point.
Up to 87 minutes legia led 2:0, but for five minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club, over the years, was in an ever-increasing state of trouble until it stopped counting on the championship and fell off the top of the game class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The legion – on its way to the title – won two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 at the exit.
Return to the Elite
Currently, boats are fighting for a return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed for at least a year, since in previous games they were one of the favorites who failed to advance to the back of the class.
As a result, a failed summer took place at the club's human resources revolution.
The authorities have changed, the coach Marcin Kaczmark has finally been put on board, and the next step up the club hierarchy is to help the fertilized in the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możenj.
For the time being, Widzew is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in the Polish Cup, he defeated the Śląsk Wrocław 2-0 extra-classer on Tuesday.
The legion in the same size played at the departure of the Desert of Nepal.
Extra-class launches
The only couple made up of top-class representatives in 1/16 finals are her ŁKS Benjamin and the Zabrze Mountain.
The games will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year is still scheduled to play 1/8 of the final (3-5 December).
The final is scheduled to take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr 's mutiny' and the investigation of impeachment must go with his track
We never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are involved in trying to hide the facts of the attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation in this case may take time," Pelosi said in an interview for CNN on the Hill of the Capitol.
"They will do the work they have begun by keeping to the facts and time needed to find them," she added.
According to the protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked President Wolodymyr Zelenski of Ukraine to conduct an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as the protocol states.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had notified the signaller's complaint concerning Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
Following the receipt of the complaint in the form of a complaint from officials from the Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice stated that Trump's phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call for a witness.
She added, however, that Barr “began to rebel. ”
It's been like this for a long time.
"The way (Barra) is mentioned in all this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's mention of his Attorney-General during a July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It's interesting that he made decisions about how to deal with a complaint.
Pelosi said she was “very afraid ” of the signalers Trump attacked Thursday as a spy, suggesting that in the past they had been treated differently with spies.
I believe that the President's words go beyond irresponsibility is dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in the discovery – the disclosure of violations in our government," said Pelosi, adding "The President's Word on people who can provide information seriously undermine honesty in the government".
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step in declaring a formal investigation into the commission of an unlawful act on the basis of allegations of attempts to pressure a leader of a foreign country in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone call was included in Thursday's complaint, in which the signaller claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "incline Ukraine to intervene" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signallist also alleged that the White House lawyers had ordered officials to remove the record of the conversation from the computer system in which it was kept for the purposes of Council of Ministers officials and to place it in a system designed for information particularly sensitive.

Possible ban on driving cars at excessive speed for the attacker of Crystal Palace Christiana Benteke
Prime Minister League to Christian Benteke, who has been caught twice in the last two months at speed, is threatened with driving bans.
The attacker of Crystal Palace, 28, confessed to driving the Bentley car at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit of 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond, southwest London, on 20 January.
Then, in March, photosradars in Putney in south-west London registered a Belga at 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Benteke from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to be in court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He confessed to both offences in early July under a simplified procedure, on the basis of which the crimes were more easily tried at a meeting held by a single judge of the room.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and the representative of the Sekondi Hasaacas Club, expressed doubts about the composition of the Verification Committee for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the involvement of Commission President Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In his interview with GNA Sport Manu, he questioned whether the President of the Commission would be honest because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons from the outside who have no ties with any of the members and who have previously not shown interest.
For example, Davies employed NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer in respect of payments of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons he should not be allowed to take a position with the Verification Commission because he has an interest in this," he argued.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, were to stand before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his association with the club, suggesting that if the Commission were to stand before Palmer, it would be a matter of prejudice and bias.
Members of the Commission were expected to start work from yesterday, following an oath at the GFA Secretariat in Akra on Tuesday 19 September, and to end it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and her members are Mr Marian Barnor, a consultant on corporate governance and a lawyer, and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on a unity government
The two main parties of Israel, the Blue-White Alliance and Likud, continued negotiations Friday on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the President's mandate to form a government mission to Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating leadership of both parties in the government and Netanyahu's position as prime minister, but – as the Israeli daily Ha'arec writes – there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Blue and White reported in a communication that it had presented preliminary proposals.
He accuses the rightful Likud that he has "kept in his positions", demanding that his leader and previous prime minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and that he be part of the office, which he had previously composed of ultraorthoxic politicians.
"From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-Bials would not agree to these conditions," they published a communication.
For many, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, want to "bring Israel to a second round of elections".
The leader of the Blue-White Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanyahu would have led as long as he is charged with three corruption cases, on the basis of which the prosecution could formally charge him after Wednesday's meeting.
"The people and the Blue-Bials won a sufficient majority in the elections on 17 September, which would allow them to share governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE.
President Reuwen Rivlin tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed the establishment of a "rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, allowing Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanyahu were upheld and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who think that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a survey published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under the rotating leadership of Netanyahu and Gantz.
This solution is supported by 50.6 percent of Israelis, 32.1 percent of those surveyed object to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – on the question of who should be the first to head the cabinet, 41.8% of respondents are behind Netanyahu and 40% are behind Gantz.
In another survey published by Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government is up to 63%, 60% opposed to the new elections that would be third this year.
On 17 September, in the early parliamentary elections, the Gantz Alliance won 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu with his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties had the 61 mandates necessary to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight against the final game with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that “this is the time to make sure” when Valia faces the final game with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
Valia's victory over the kangaroos would put this team in a position of favor to win Group D and ensure its participation in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be quickly sent to England in one eighth of the finals.
"Let's be clear, both teams want to try and get through this and be at the head of the group," said the Welsh wrestler Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last fall it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they'll be eager to take that victory away from us, and we want to bring it back again.
Before we got here, you knew it was going to be a big start.
And now we're here and it's really time to check it out.
Valia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – 32 years ago in a third-place match when the kangaroos defeated.
And their overall record under the leadership of coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the southern hemisphere.
Valia represented a series of 13 lost test matches from Australia's hands last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of this win 9-6 who will run to Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked if the team had experienced mental blockage before that victory, added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so even that maybe... people expect there to be some sort of mental blockage, I don't know.
We probably left about 15 points on the field at the end of the last match, so the final result looks like a much smaller advantage than it actually was.
If Valia triumphs, then the fight of Tipurica with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the mill by Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and the fall will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colors of the team and met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he is waiting for.
"They are players in the position of the seventh absolute world class," he said.
When playing against the world-class third-line players, it is always known that a difficult game will be played.
These two are always playing with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and to challenge yourself than to face the third line of the mill, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and in dealing with these two, you certainly have to be in top shape.
I wouldn't say Sunday is almost the finale of the Cup, but for us it's an important match in this World Cup.
The impet is an important element of it.
When we build strength and work hard all the time, we'll fly on our wings and it'll be hard to beat us.

The premiere of the book.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Millsman
They were supposed to be an elite "race of lords".
They took into their ranks those whom they despised.
Is it possible to combine crime more strongly than a national identity?
In your hands, we are handing over another book on war or military matters.
We are giving a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
Historians from various European countries analyze the attitude and motivation of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Were the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a unit made up of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative of cooperation in individual European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the book “Waffen-SS” answers these questions on the basis of solid research material.
We sought to present a more subtle and balanced, closer picture of cooperation in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of history and a given period of history by presenting the debates of researchers from different countries. (...) As long as the fates of the main victims of the war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of the Nazi Germans, the Slavic population - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are examined in principle from a national perspective (as far as this is concerned).
"A total panic" when the White House struggles to find arguments on impeachment
Officials from the White House are shocked to learn how to resist the renewed pressure on impeachment Thursday, and one of the speakers in the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
It seems that this adds to the "settle, uncertainty and fears" – one of the people associated with the White House thus describes the mood in the western wing – that the allegations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people in his environment.
She said: “There is no guarantee that there is nothing to hide there. ”
Officials of the White House were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that standard methods of effectively avoiding the President's controversy in the past may not work. "It does not look like something that will pass away with the emergence of another cycle of news headlines," the person joked.
Another cognizant of the discussion described the atmosphere prevailing in the White House as a "state of shock", accompanied by increasing mistrust, that along with the ongoing investigation of impeachment, the likelihood of the President answering in an irresponsible manner and becoming "hard to control".
This concern is shared by another speaker who claims that the President's environment foresees that he will manifest more "controversial" behaviour, and the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way explode – this is in the context of the electoral year a concern both from the perspective of the Presidency and the elections.
Faced the biggest threat so far in the presidency, Trump has circled from attack to defense, again reaching out for a strategy that he considered effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in investigating his political rivals in order to draw attention to the actions of the Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden and discredit the informant as a party-led instigator.
But while many people in the White House are being treated in the fight after Mueller's investigation, something has changed this time – consultants and consultants said.
The president, whose identifying mark is force, was shown to be defeated by the Wednesday press conference – one of the people familiar with the situation said.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he did not seem willing to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them hold that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of this controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski – which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as is often the case when the president is the target of attacks, this fact is brought up by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the republican strategies related to the White House indicates that the results of the polls of support for the President are sky-high, and the impeachment will not have much effect on the acquisition of new sympathies.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if it makes its legislative agenda difficult and predominates in the new cycle of news headlines.
Another spokeswoman claims that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worried White House officials sought counsellors' help, completing their response to impeachment.
According to the person who knows about the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear whether any initiative in the style of the command centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person has stated that there is a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leader who is able to launch a PR attack that is a riposte for the publication of a belligerent's edible report, with a view to halting the spread of democratic action on the impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
The interviewer, familiar with the situation, maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they were not going to disclose a note describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President, and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
It is now expected that the pressure will be greater than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which mostly kept silent and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who may be involved in the development of the response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, the man from Trump's dirty work and former chief of staff, said the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski told NBC News that it is not true that he will direct this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his programme," he said, "but I did not engage in any discussions with the President or his team about joining the team to resist the false narrative of impeachment."
Donald Trump's private lawyer from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in the impeachment.
"We are responding to matters properly" – Sekulov replied when he was asked by NBC News to comment.
At present, the White House is experiencing a lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked with Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, has left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, does not have this type of experience.
The interviewer, familiar with the White House strategy, stated that at no time were officials planning to engage people or create a command centre, but acknowledged the need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could fight a political struggle.
Explorer of the Seas of the Royal Caribbean has been through repairs for 89 million pounds
The Explorer of the Seas, who belongs to the Royal Caribbean International family, will take the flight this summer, presenting a completely new look.
After the renewal, which has absorbed an impressive 110 million dollars (89 million pounds), the ship delights in a wide selection of culinary flavors from around the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the entire family.
This summer the Explorer will stop at the most magnificent ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to taste Mediterranean Europe.
When the ship’s adventure is over, the ship’s crew promises untold impressions at sea.
Having an offer to satisfy everyone, the Explorer, after renovations costing $110 million, about £89 million, moved into a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the entire family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surfing simulators or watch their favorite family film using the charms of the weather, as part of the outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which enable passengers of interior cabins to admire ocean views without having to board.
Water lovers will be delighted by the newly designed swimming pool linking the style of the Caribbean resort with the charms of the water park.
The swimming pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and sunbeds ideal for sunbathing, and two modernized slides are within reach of people thirsty for strong impressions on board.
Attractive traveller for passengers of all ages impresses with the number of activities available to guests while travelling to destinations.
Created with a view to small children's Adventure Ocean is an opportunity for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and an exclusive place of leisure for teenagers offers great games and a music zone prepared for people over the age of 12.
If this turns out to be insufficient, the whole family can face a laser tag with a dark lighting effect in "studio B" on board, which in an impressive way can also serve as a ice cream resort for skating.
Guests will also have the opportunity to learn exotic tastes from all over the world on board during their voyage to the Mediterranean Sea.
Modern Asian cuisine is offered on the ship in the restaurant Izumi, and in the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is provided excellent food inspired by a novel look at the traditional Italian cuisine.
Other gastronomic points on board include the American restaurant serving Chops Grille steaks, the Latin bar Boleros, Schooner Bar and the Johnny Rockets Express Bar.
The flight, with the option of a seven- or nine-day route, leaves Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has also recently undergone an incredible renovation.
After a 58-day metamorphosis of Allure, in total costing a gigantic $165 million, the flight operator offered the guests who had previously made the reservation a voucher worth $300 to be issued on board the ship.
The tour operator stated: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager-class ship to undergo transformation in the framework of the Royal Amplified fleet modernisation.”
The programme, which requires investments of over $1 billion, including 10 ships and a four-year period, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of opportunities: from unique attractions and gastronomic experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "naked pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of California clearly cannot bear the naked truth of President Donald Trump's investigation.
In his presidential defense Thursday, he accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the Board of Intelligence of the House of Representatives, made the above charge during the preliminary statement during the hearing of the signaller's complaint, as if Trump had asked Ukraine for assistance in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal the "grotesque presentation" of the left and their "media aces" before he said that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in negligee.
"Democrats in this committee have been negotiating with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the president on trial when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimends, the political reporter at HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to find out.
So far, only a representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is the naked truth, which confirms the thoughts of many of his colleagues and friends.
The Mediaite.com portal suspects that Nunes' comments on nudity refer to "some more popular and unconfirmed information" which is likely to appear in the controversial Steele acts,
This is celebrated by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that appears to be showing him the urinating prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be to avoid renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that will enable renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environment, which began working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuels derived from fat waste, such as restaurant fat, animal fat and rape oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than for oil fuels, as well as the use of waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is designed to simulate hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our first-generation technology has done," said Bressler, "is [in fact] the creation of hydrocarbons, which are identical particles to diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilise at lower temperatures, which in the case of large-scale aircraft posed a serious threat.
"Air fuel problem is a bit of a mix-up," Bressler said.
It's actually less valuable than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on the commercialisation of the product because airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, are increasing investments in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine times when the situation can be reversed and a carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will constitute an emergency plan.
Forge is currently operating a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support a $25 million production facility located in Sombra, Ontario.
The bet is expected to produce about 19 million litres of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the projected carbon reduction will be around 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further carbon reduction.
"As a tech specialist," said Bressler,
I have the task of developing options that enable informed decisions and many choices."
DISCHANGE: Another Fraud on a granddaughter
8 000 PLN and 750 euros lost Zaměstje's apartment thinking she was helping her grandson, who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a con artist.
"The woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he'll go to jail.
The senior wanted to help her grandson passed 8 000 PLN and 750 euros to the fake police officer who came to her house," said Professor Dorota Krukowska-Bubilo of the Polish police.
The police are looking for the perpetrators, and once again they're calling for caution:
“Every phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion or in haste.
Remember, cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we get a call asking for financial support, which will raise our suspicions, we need to respond immediately and notify the police by calling 911.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the threats, let's let them know how the scams work.
Please be careful and do not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that if Britain's brexito is withdrawn, they are threatening to make a move like in Los Angeles, and he calls for peace.
One of the cabinet's top ministers said last night that the country is threatened with "a violent social surge" if the initial result is challenged by the outcome of the second referendum.
The allies of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was at risk of social unrest as a result of protests of "yellow vests" in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a "satisfaction" during a heated argument about the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "resign".
Despite his call for peace, the minister of the cabinet said "The Times": "There have never been any protests in this country, such as demonstrations of "gilets jaunes" ("yellow vests") or of Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gillets jaunes – using encrypted phones to coordinate pickets, and to push people to protest, there are enough unfriendly populist leaders.
Apartments in Los Angeles exploded after the jury acquitted four white police officers who beat up a black cab driver, Rodney King, in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests – jaunes guilette – have been emptying and desolating the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the Municipal Chamber and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people will vote, 66% of them will plead for the remaining UK in the European Union, ten million citizens will be unhappy," the minister said.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their Member and who will not forgive.
It doesn't take much to see a couple of tens of thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the cabinet's top ministers added that the country is threatened with a "species social surge" if the result of the first referendum is challenged by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a popular election in which voters would decide the fate of the Brexite.
According to reports, the prime minister faces the risk of a cabinet mutiny seeking to lower its demands for brexito and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The pub, Čubovna and Krosny were delighted in Krakow.
Follow us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) to 11 inspiring presentations by speakers, including Simon Holovnia, Krystyna Čubovna or Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all within the Talk'N'Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expansion of the horizons, discussion of ideas worth spreading, and joint discussions that may become an impetus for further development.
This was the goal set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 special representatives, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, including people known from the media - Simona Hollowia, Kristyna Čubovna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The motto of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and it was around creating the future that guests were focused on the appearances of invited guests to the conference.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drewecki, who told about how the brand that is built around us can affect our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, arguing that they should be accepted if the future was to be created, Chris Badura took the subject of empathy in the era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference was opened by a multi-compartment conversation with Krystyna Čubovna, who told, among other things, how the profession of lecturer in Poland changed over the years.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that, thanks to the development of technology, today everyone can find it difficult to do so.
However, it does not believe that in the years ahead, a person in the position of lecturer should be completely replaced by technology.
It was after that that Peter Nabielec took the problem of living in times of informational, emotional, or choice overload, giving the public valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Lukasz Lątóch spoke about what another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
Learning to play, learning to play
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Oneak to the scene.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the audience with pantonymism, and then, as an example of his own career, told about how he tried to maintain the right balance between careers on stage and private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Simon Holovnia, stressing above all the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can diametrically change the situation and you need to be ready to use that time.
In addition, he shared his thoughts about the reality surrounding us, calling for anecdotes that might have caused a smile on the audience’s faces.
Then Adrian Creator appeared on the stage, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Słowak, on the example of Rubik’s ankle, told us about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly introduced something new to the reality of all those who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests indicate great public involvement.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all who were unable to personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority have introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the rule of three-way power," the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights reported on Thursday.
The report "Legal governments instead of rule of law" documents, inter alia, changes in justice and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled "Legal governments instead of rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019."
The Foundation estimates in the report that in 2015-2019 there was a major regression in the protection of human rights in Poland after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority have introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the threefold power.
In adapting the right to political objectives, the rule of law governments have been replaced," writes HFPC experts.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of the LGBT and the right to a fair process).
The report also sums up the three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on this scale, we have observed the use of the right to exercise partial party interests.
This translates into a continuing crisis of rule of law, as well as a weakening of the entire system of human rights protection in Poland," stressed lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years have been "the period of systemic change both in the country" and "in the field of human rights protection".
Over the past four years, the Parliament has adopted more than 20 key acts in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite the concerns of the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations," explained lawyer Małgorzat Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the lack of respect for binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the protection of human rights guarantees".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs has considered "the situations in which the authorities have not reacted or have simply ignored the emerging cases of aggression".
The Foundation’s experts noted that some changes have been made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the State's activity in the field of the limitation of rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law actors.
"No implementation of these recommendations only weakens Poland's position as leader of democratic change in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also exposes the Polish state to the responsibility for violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of the star of Pakistani social media with life for honour killing
Women's rights experts say that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to the prolonged proceedings, the release of suspects on bail and the removal of public awareness cases.
"It is so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, defender of women's rights and founder of Pakistan's first department of gender studies at the university, and adds that even the widespread murder of Baloch has been resolved for more than three years.
Although reliable data are difficult to establish according to women's rights groups, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 reported at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and a network promoting awareness of honour-related crimes estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed worldwide every year in Pakistan.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the transmissions to the country are shrinking, as many immigrants are permanently residing outside Poland – says the Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
According to the latest Euro-Tax report, the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to over PLN 8.6 000 in 2018, which means that they increased by almost a thousand PLN, i.e. almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish expatriates in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migrations of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better at international labour market, where they use various options.
"There is also an increasing number of specialists and professionals who are moving from country to country in search of ever-increasing conditions, just as international corporate workers do," the paper said.
Some Euro-Tax clients work in two countries during the year, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
"This is the most important in FRFN in 2018, because by 11%, the total earnings of Polish emigrants increased (to nearly PLN 27 billion).
However, most of the money was made by the Poles in the islands – almost 35 billion PLN", we read further.
The President of Euro-Taxu believes that despite the improvement in working conditions in the Polish market, the number of emigrants does not decrease.
Because still saxes in the West and North of Europe (led by Norway) are often a chance for several times more earnings than in Poland.
‘Even at minimum rates in the country concerned, which, for example, in Germany amount to €9.5-11.7 per hour,’ the journal reports.
The Republic states that the Poles remain not only because of higher earnings, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles are starting roots abroad, as can be seen from the dwindling remittances to the country.
These last year were the lowest in years.
As economist Tadeusz Khrosticki reminds us, along with the extension of the stay abroad, there is a smaller group of people who transfer money to the country and their height decreases.
"Emmigrants draw close to each other," we read on Friday's "The Republic".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and the unprecedented rainfall has caused death as a result of the collapse of buildings and the destruction of many crops.
Normally, in northern India, monsun retreats in early September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Department of Meteorology, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon for decades.
In many parts of the country, the rains are still unusual – in the western part of Pune, the city of Pune, and the rains of Thursday have led to the deaths of a dozen people and the devastation caused by the collapse of buildings.
There was a flood of houses, people took to the streets in the water for their knees, which normally occurs only during the monsoon apogeum.
Large rainfall also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
The monsoon also began with a delay.
Water was scarce in many areas, so farmers prepared for a likely drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
That amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
“My vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot through it,” says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and late ending monsoon means a rise in the price of onions, an essential ingredient of Indian food.
Onion, which usually had to be paid for 20 rupees (0.23 pounds) is currently worth 80 rupees (about 1 pound UK) per kilogram in cities like Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another large festival is the celebration of Dasara on October 8th, during which Hindus raise huge dolls like the comic book, representing Ravana, a character with a lush moustache and a sinister smile from the "Ramajana" epoch.
Ravana's burning symbolizes a triumph of good over evil.
But given that Ravana's likeness was made out of paper, if the monsoon continues, it is Ravana who will laugh the last.
Implementation of the Agreement for the Sale of Shares of Energosynergy Technology Sp. z o.o. in Restructuring
On 27 September 2019, the Fund’s bank account was affected by the price for sale of 26,843 shares in Energosynergy Technology Sp. z o.o. in restructuring amounting to PLN 100 000.
Thus the ownership of these shares went to INDOS S.A. based in Chorzów.
The agreement for the sale of shares was made in the light of the waiver of the other shareholders from the right of priority of acquisition of shares and of the consent of the shareholders to dispose of such rights.

Doodle celebrates 21st birthday Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the questions that are bothering us.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How many?" are one of the popular categories sought by Poles.
According to data from the giant, last year we were willing to ask, among other things, “Where is the storm?”, “How do you make asparagus?” and “How many fingers does a horse have?”, “How do you get rid of a mustache? ”
Today's search engine is celebrating its twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and in Poland up to 96% people use Google's "Uncle" – welcome to today's special Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google reminds us of its birthdays, showing a fixed computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner printed a digital date – as in a picture from the 1990s.
Cataloguing information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is wordplay.
It comes from a mathematical term Google indicating the number of tens raised to a hundredth power.
This name was also intended to reflect the company's intentions to index as many web sites as possible.
The Google search engine was founded by Sergei Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the methods of regular segregation of results based on the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages connecting the result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon later launched the famous Google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" shows information about the extremely accurate Google search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, subjugating further markets and increasing the value of the company.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index has over a billion entries, making the work of Page and Brin the largest Internet search engine in the world.
Today, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So is there any other field to develop?
"The mission of Google is to organise global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made great progress in this area, it is a very long way to reach this goal," Peter Zalewski of Google Poland provided in a conversation with "Newsweek".
Common exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that working with exposure to high concentration plant protection products can translate into a high risk of heart disease in later years.
This is the case with a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who have been tested for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the most contact with them were 45 percent more vulnerable to heart disease or stroke.
“This study underlines the need for personal protection equipment to be used during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording medical contacts with such means at work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease”, said Dr Beatrice Rodriguez, coauthor of the study.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results were based on data from more than 6,000 men on Oahu, who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu cardiology programme.
As researchers have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, since they concerned only Japanese men of origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their effects on health can be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
This was probably because ageing factors were more important, which masked possible causal relationships between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later years.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone call Zelenski-Trump: Poroszenko drops his three coins
Washington's policy has a stormy week in connection with the initiation of an impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump
Getting involved in a political scandal is for political debutant Wolodymyr Zelenski a situation he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first of them?
Almost at the beginning of Trump's phone call, he told Zelenski that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the White House notes are incomplete, they describe in detail Trump's attack on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for the fact that German leaders, together with other leaders of European countries, are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy was sparked by Zelenski's response, who announced that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views has led politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, to choose to vote through social services.
Petro Porosenko, former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that EU support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroszenko said he was grateful for the EU support provided during the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their fears, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now? ”
Trump then referred to military assistance and asked Zelenski to investigate not one but two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and the second referring to breaking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on Democratic e-mails during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether this will spoil European relations or break relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to speak ill of anyone...
We thank all those who are helping us," said Zelenski at the UN General Assembly, following the publication of the recording of the Zelenski phone call in New York.
Zelenski is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the “Norse Four” to be held in October.
Former Provincial Inspector Legally Unlawful
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of his actions.
After six years Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court in Industry cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Regional Inspectorate of Trade Quality of the Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, on the charge of exceeding the powers.
The Lublin Public Prosecutor's Office accused him of betraying the then Marshal of Voivodship's control of the food oil-producing plant.
There has recently been a valid acquittal in this matter.
The appeal was recognised on September 12th.
‘The court upheld the arraigned acquittal,’ confirmed Judge Małgorzata Reiser, spokesman for the District Court in Industry.
It is a judgment issued on 14 February by the District Court in Industry.
Jerzy Wiśniewski then commented on Facebook: “It has been six years since I was introduced by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin to the alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpacki Region on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and did not break the law in force at that time.
I was convinced that my phone call at the time with the Marshal of the Podkarpacki Region was in conformity with the applicable law.
The version of the events published by the press, drawn up in 2013, by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin, was true and caused irreparable damage both to the food producer and to the loss of my image of my person to my employers, to my employees as well as to the local community.
The indictment against me in the opinion of the Court contained a number of errors, false facts, inadequacies of the legal basis, not actually confirmed by the events.
With the help of the CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately fired from my job and deprived of my financial resources.
I've been staying for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remind ourselves.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the Provincial Inspector of Quality of Agricultural and Food Articles from 2009 to 2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin filed charges in 2013.
According to the investigators, he was supposed to betray the then marshal of the province (Mirosław Karapata was sentenced to 4 years in prison) for inspection at a food oil plant belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of Carpathian.
This warning, according to the Lublin prosecutors, was to cause the company's owner to know about the controls and to correct the oil labels that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard charges of exceeding his rights, which threatened him to be deprived of his liberty for up to three years.
"I feel relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the final verdict that exonerated me from the charges I had made," Jerzy Wiśniewski commented.
The White House was trying to hide the recording of the conversation with Zelenski
On Thursday's revised report, the broadcaster wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to President Wolodymyr Zelenski of Ukraine, sought to interfere with the U.S. elections, and the White House tried to hide the record of the conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated August 12, an intelligence officer wrote: “As part of my official duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the President was using his office to demand the intervention of a foreign country in the 2020 elections in the United States.”
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to carry out his own interests.
Exactly – he was trying to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president re-elect in 2020," the report quoted by the journal "The Hill" reads.
The Ukrainian leader was given an "understand" that his contacts with Trump depend on whether he would "show the will to take the game" in matters that he was to be informed more precisely by President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but points out that he was informed in detail of its content by “many White House officials who had direct information on the matter” and their relations were covered.
"The following days after this conversation, I learned from many US officials that high-ranking representatives of the White House intervened in order to "seat" all the archival records concerning this conversation, and in particular the literal record that was drawn up, as usual, in the White House's crisis room," we read further.
"High-ranking White House officials told me that the White House lawyers "have ordered them" to remove the electronic record from the information system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," the author wrote.
"In my assessment, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the broadcaster said.
As the AP comments, this document will likely speed up the proceedings on the President's possible impeachment and also provide valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this.
The recording of the conversation with the Zelenski White House, after the Congress's pressure, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationship of the persons who witnessed it.
The content of the report, as revised, was revealed a day later by the committee of intelligence of the House of Representatives.
Also on Thursday, acting as director of American intelligence, Joseph Maguire testified to the board of intelligence of the House of Representatives and explained how the interviewer’s report was handled.
Maguire said the signaler made the right choice and did what the law ordered.
He also stressed that in his view, talking to Zelenski was an event "without precedent".
The Democrats in the Intelligence Committee asked Maguire why he had blocked the provision of a signalling report to Congress; the Director of Intelligence replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, whose confidential nature guarantees the so-called executive power's privilege.
Part of Maguire's committee hearing was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi informed that, in view of the suspicion that the President was exerting pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trump.
A day later, she estimated that Trump's recording of the interview with Zelenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken election and security standards.
Electoral law in the United States prohibits the use of foreign aid.
On Thursday, White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham said that there was “nothing wrong” in the conversation, and in the report, “there is nothing more than a collection of third-hand relations and joint press clippings”.
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and the false narrative promoted by mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded in proof that Ghana had obtained the highest number of aviation safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent in terms of temporary implementation rate (EI).
This was the case when ICAO completed its inspection of the ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency’s General Audit Programme.
The protection award was proof of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO standards and security protocols at Ghana's airports and airspace.
The prize programme has been developed to support the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 security certificates have been granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and security standards.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, the Director-General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nia Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa were present.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuywa Benard Aliu, stressed the need for Member States to maintain security in the airspace.
He stated that "it is important to keep in mind that even in the innovation era, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities".
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the state's efforts, as they complement the hard work and the persistence of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for the development of the country's economy, saying "Airports have powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection that we have achieved."
DISAPPEARMENT: He was tanking and running, and he stole a bike.
50-year-old from the municipality Zaměst drove his Audi under the distributor, tanked and left without paying.
That's how he robbed gas stations several times.
A man also stole a bicycle from one of the Zambian authorities a month ago.
The gas station owners have estimated the losses at almost 1 000 PLN.
Owner of stolen bicycle – PLN 2,000.
Last Tuesday, one of the local districts noticed an Audi Wyszyński Street, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
There was a wanted 50-year-old behind the wheel.
The man was detained in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard allegations of fuel theft from 4 petrol stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
The uniforms also found a stolen bicycle.
The trail will soon return to the owner.
Stealing a thief is punishable by imprisonment until the age of five.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as FEMA's boss: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as administrator of the Federal Agency for Crisis Management (FEMA), smiles when testifying at the Senate National Security Sub-Committee on the FEMA Financial Proposal for 2020 on the Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on 3 April 2019.
WASZINGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the deputy administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has acted without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March when Brock Long dismissed this position.
Long gave up after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to which FEMA belongs, found that Long had misused government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough background check revealed allegations that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination for this position was expected.
In order to approve his nomination for this role, a majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House informed that before Gaynor became Deputy Administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, is considering thumb amputation
A 28-year-old runner specializes at a distance of 1,500 metres, winning a gold medal of the 2012 European Championship (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the Deputy Minister of Europe for 5,000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new disability and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the games in 2016, but the pain returned and this season became very intense.
Pain causes me to put my foot in a different way, which changes my body system, other unnatural burdens happen, and I start to feel pain in other places, for example, in my hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for the world championship, and for two weeks the pain is so severe that I have difficulty wearing rings – said the runner on the TV channel of the NRK.
Father and coach Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after a long discussion with his son, the only solution for him not to finish his career and participate in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems to be the only one, though a drastic solution and decision has already come true.
"If a part of the body hurts, it should be disposed of and, in fact, Henrik doesn't need this finger that badly, and in this case, the cosmetic aspect should be forgotten," he explained.
Police are closing down an illegal e-cigarette factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
A raid was made on the office building near 9600 Telstar Avenue around 16:37 p.m., during which police searched for illegal e-cigarettes containing marijuana and found large layers containing butane hashish oil, a concentrate of cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police Department, the officers also found a device that was used to supplement the contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," Cano says.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that distillation of oil used in lime products is a potentially flammable process.
"The usual electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the fires to ignite, not only by fire, but by concentration, even by explosion," he says.
"If we have many layers and the like in the room, there will be another explosion, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could dislodge the entire complex.
A task force was called on to address illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is currently unknown.
The detectives say they got an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant, which led to the detection of illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to get information on who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up a business here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products have not been found on the street, given recent articles on the harmfulness of callousness.
"People really don't know what products they buy," Cano says.
"They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our community and children, which is why we always respect them before reaching for such things.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has decided to take another medicine for molds
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate informed that the medicinal product has been withdrawn for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine used to treat molds and yeast infections in the mouth, infection with Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to non-compliance with the requirements of the product quality specification and a decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenium Laboratory in Olsztyn.
On average, each month, GIF issues several decisions to withdraw each series of products from the market.
A series of medicines which are stopped in circulation in Poland can be re-entered on the market after proof of safety has been provided.
There is no such possibility if the medicine is withdrawn.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collector's banknote about this nomination?
He wears the 19 gold name and displays the image of Ignace Jan Paderewski.
In early October a new collector's note will be put into circulation, said the National Bank of Poland.
It's another banknote from the "Independence" series.
It is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Company.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date shown on the note, 25 January 2019, is the date on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW was established.
Also nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the Factory" - we read in the NBP communication.
The watermark shows the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
The novelty is a holographic belt placed on a window on the floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription "inviolable" is a stylized picture of the Order of the White Eagle.
This inscription, illustrated by Joseph Pilsudsky's manuscript, is a logo of the 100th anniversary of Poland's restoration of independence.
A branch of wool, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, was composed of security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, a special form of angular effect.
On the reverse page of the banknote there was an image of the town of the factory based on the panorama of modern Warsaw.
Next to the PWPW logo is the SPARK Live security and the opalescent belt, also visible in UV light in the form of repeat numbers "19" and "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is due to enter circulation on October 2nd to 55,000 pieces.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by the NBP, including those from special series, are legal tender in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collector's market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, or more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded to the boat.
He sailed 50 miles across the river from there.
Jarosław Kaczyński votes in favour of Gosiewska Malgorzata
PIS President Jarosław Kaczyński will vote in the upcoming elections for Małgorzata Gosiewska.
"Please do the same," he urged.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for the photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" boasted in the social media that it would win Kaczyński's vote in the parliamentary elections.
“The President of Law and Justice, Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, supports Małgorzata Gosiewska”, we read on her Facebook profile.
The party chief pointed out that he was sensitive, sensitive and always ready to help.
"I will give my voice to Małgorzata Gosiewska and I ask the same thing," he urges.
Gosiewska runs for the 19th District Fair (Warsaw) and third place on the list.
The "single" is Kaczyński himself, and Mariusz Kaminski is second.
The Christmas Book Fair is coming.
In front of us are meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpacia are said not to read books.
We will show that it is different," Martha Halftorak said during the press conference.
And who will this year support reading in Rzeszów?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia will appear at the fair, shouting the first chef of the Republic of Poland, as well as: Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn in Millennium Hall will be a great cultural event – November 22 and 23 to the shopping center of the 3rd edition of the Christmas Fair of the Book, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and bookkeeping officers from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be up to 30 of them, including Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book novelties that participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with writers.
This time the authors were invited to write about important matters and are not afraid to take difficult topics, and they are also prize winners of prestigious awards and... great cooks.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best seller "Loneliness in the Network", and the queen of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
Sister Anastasia, author of a dozen books (including cookbooks) sold in over 4 million copies, will be the star of this year's fair.
Exhibition of the missing dress of Elizabeth I at the Hampton Court Palace
The silver-plated dress made of the most famous silk chamlot has been adorned with embroidery for plants, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historical Royal Palace Foundation, it meant only one thing.
The faded fabric hanging for 100 years on the wall of the small rural parish church she was looking at could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn stumbled upon an exhibition of altar cloth in Bacton County of Herefordshire, Elizabeth's missing dress was about to hit an exhibition next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same rooms where the Tudor Queen could have worn it more than 450 years ago.
The significance of this discovery is that only one element of the 16th-century dress survived from the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no solid evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research strengthened experts to believe that she had to be part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silverheads", incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the suit belonged to the most famous of the people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, could have cost Tudor's estate an equivalent.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women in the yard and would not tolerate rivals wearing such creative fabrics," Lynn says.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the dresses.
I was really pleased to see the dress, too, and to be impressed with it, and to be practically convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
Long, re-life dress, cut to serve as altar cloth in the dark St Faith church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elizabeth lady of the court, served the queen throughout her long life and was identified in local legends by what was said.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or the parish to remember Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of maintenance work, four hundred of which ended up in the most delicate hand stitch with specially colored silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will be shown next to the exhibition at the Hatfield House Palace, a portrait of the Rainbow Portrait, one of the most famous paintings of the time representing Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"During the work with historical fabrics, the kunsty of the people who did it really starts to be respected," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in a converted greenhouse in the Hampton Court Palace – the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelins.
"Looking at the embroidery from the front and back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth exhibition will begin on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace
The Fitch Agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
The agency Fitch confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in a foreign currency at the level “A-” – the communication stated.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well diversified economy, which is supported by sound economic policies and a strong banking sector", says the Ministry of Finance communication.
As added, Fitch noted that Poland was at the top of the economic cycle, and between 2019 and 2021 the real growth rate of Gross National Product in Poland would be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the government deficit to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below the limit of 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The government and self-government debt ratio for GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent according to the Agency and will be lower in the coming years (on average 48.3 per cent between 2020 and 2021)" we read.
Rating of Poland
The S&P and Moody's will complete the autumn round of Polish ratings on 11 October.
The rating of Poland in Fitch's assessment remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's “A-” rating with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's creditworthiness is the highest rated by Moody's – at the level of “A2”.
The rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The prospects of all evaluations are stable.
What's a rating?
Credit rating agencies are set up to help investors assess the risk of their investment activities.
Ratings shall be granted to companies, banks and states.
For these latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Ratings are nothing more than a credit rating.
It makes decisions about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests who is best not to lend any credit at all, because there is a high risk that money will not be recovered.
A lower rating involves a higher risk.
On the other hand, higher risks are high interest rates on credit.
Each assessment must be justified and reasoned.
Ratings can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
Currently, over 90 percent of the world credit rating services market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own evaluation system.
‘Five Confederates’: First 1000 plus
The Five Confederations, the main foundations of the electoral programme, presented candidates to the 40-round Fair in Koszalin on Friday, applying for a mandate from the KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence list.
Krzysztof Chmielewski, leader of the Koszalin List to the Krzysztof Chmielewski Sejm, presented the slogans "Fifth of the Confederate".
“First of all, the 1000 plus programme for Poland, secondly, quick and fair courts, third cultural voucher and educational voucher, after fourth national security, fifthly, this is a healthy life,” Chmielewski said.
He noted that "Polish people must finally start earning a decent living", which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with a tax-free amount will solve itself".
"Polacks need to be given a choice where they want to save their pension money, i.e. zero PIT and a voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the letter on the "1000 plus programme for Poland".
On the other hand, Alexander Zadeck, starting from the second place of the list, referring to the programme's slogan "healthy life" said that "food is getting worse" and to change this, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy also advocates the cessation of "stimulation of hemp".
Zadenko declared support to the Confederation for "development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also spoke on behalf of her group for “voluntary vaccinations”.
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
The other candidates for the Koshalin District Fair stressed that the Confederation is in favour of "implementing a deep judicial reform", which would include examining the case by the judge "day after day".
They also argued that the education subsidy would be given to schools without the intervention of the authorities, which they said would be without any additional costs associated with the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also behind "a strong Polish army, based on the Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Fair stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "continuous access to energy".
"We can gas coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, and we need to consider going back to the idea of an atomic power plant," Piotr Karpinski, fifth on the electoral list, said.
The chief of the Mexican cartel is behind a third of drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported a morning drive for drugs.
Brian McKnight of the DEA has fully demonstrated what's going on.
Last year, almost 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight found "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"It is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for federal executives in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The award for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Genacion, i.e. CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs that reach the United States by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl contaminated heroin.
There's a $10 million reward for El Mencho's head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug-related charges and was eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created the brutal cartel.
He's got a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, 50-caliber weapons.
In principle, it has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho is unpunished to protect his empire by using measures such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in a public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In a cocaine pack lab, it's branded as a smuggler.
For over a third of them, the traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"It is he who is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone’s child dies, Donahue believes that there is “a great chance ” that drugs come from El Mencho.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, according to the French prosecutor's office.
The defendant shall ensure that he has documents compromising the Presidential couple.
He asked the head of state for 300,000 euros in cash, among others.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work for the police in France claims to have received “explosive” documents from a person employed in the Palace of Elisha.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the Presidential couple, but revealing them in full could even threaten the safety of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return he demanded 300,000 euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from the previous marriage.
According to the D.A., the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would pass it on to the media – but so far it is not known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the audit at this 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric examinations, but the doctors did not indicate any serious disorders.
PS4 will be old-school – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the debuting soon game available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
In a recent presentation, Sony announced that the premiere of The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
More details were revealed on the days after the loud premiere of the section of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old-school climates in many ways.
We've decided on something we haven't seen too often since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a great story given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel had grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"Fabula is ambitious and has turned into aspects in which the unit was not," he said.
It had to be so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the biggest game, it just happened.
"It excites us to see how many possibilities there is in this story. There will be moments when you think you are going to the final, but you will realize that it is only the beginning and that a whole new chapter is beginning," Druckmann continues.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place it has been revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easer eggi about adult content (information given by Gamespot).
We're not gonna ruin the surprise, but the easer egos in the game refer to the old-school Naughty Dog.
You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the above-mentioned Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place a premier order on the sequel, Sony said there would be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult figure.
Run, pull and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the first-class Stomil will take the Podbeskid and want to win.
The Stomil players are undefeated from three rounds.
Petar Zajczykowski's supporters won seven points at the time because they won the match with Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match, the goalless draw in Suwałky fell.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskida on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites for the promotion to Extraclassa.
The closest Stomil rivals take fourth place in the table and have the advantage over the team from Olsztyn.
This season's underages were played six times this season and two victories, draws and failures made Natost Stomil feel very good on his property – at the stadium near Al. Piłsudski 69a the team of Piotr Zayszkowski won three times and once lost.
In total, in ten rows, the impostors gathered 17 points and are at the head of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the game, nothing was announced.
"Every change takes time to produce results," explains Peter Skiba.
"And finally, something happened to us, and we believed in ourselves, and we can also work under normal conditions.
We just focused on the ball game.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil players eliminated the Polish Movement Chorzów Cup, but they needed matches and a series of penalty throws.
In the south of Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go because Coach Zażykowski let those key players rest before Saturday's fight with Podbeskid.
In Chorzów, however, James Mosakovsky, who finally fired his long - awaited gate, played a return after his injury.
“It’s always nice to get a goal, and I’m still at such a moment that we can continue to play in cups (Mosakovsky leveled at 3:3 in the 119th minute – red).
My dad used to bite at me and laugh at me that I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he wouldn't expect me to."
Now Mosakowski is counting on returning to the base, especially because of the yellow cards he can't play Oleh Tarasenko.
"That's why I'm pushing hard at training to be able to play first in the game," Mosakowski says.
"I have done everything in Chorzów to present myself to the best of my ability.
However, whether I play or sit on the reserve bench, I'm going to support the team as strongly as possible.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
Surely we will face a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run, burn and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who recently also got hurt, so if he does, we will only find out on Saturday, especially since Coach Zajztkowski traditionally tries to keep the staff secret until the end of the case.
A man raped and murdered his niece.
"You will never see daylight.
You will never breathe fresh air again," Judge Kevin K. Allen said, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and vile that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple indicated the location of the body.
"How could anyone do this to his own niece?" asked Day Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," said Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the murdered girl's mother.
"Our lives will never be the same again," added a crushed woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotion during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted to kidnapping, sexually exploiting, and murdering a girl.
A man’s lawyer said that his client was raised in an “inadequate family”.
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to suffer the punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without the possibility of applying for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will transfer nearly $100 million in additional funds to affected communities.
The money-providing programme for farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of farm allowances will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million for a drought-affected community support initiative, allowing eligible farmers to receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the drought relief programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure grants and assistance in coping with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than $7 billion earmarked by the government for the drought fund.

Chinese Betrayals (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)
Documentary: In China, divorce rates have doubled in the last decade.
This was generally caused by third parties.
More and more men are maintaining extramarital relations, which has resulted in a special industry in this country – professional love hunters who are tasked with saving the marriage of cheating wives.
Let's chant loudly: Ma-te-us!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister to the Silesia Bakery
A special general test was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in the Silesia Bakery.
"Dear Sir, louder, louder, this way we will not welcome your Prime Minister here!
Let us chant loudly: Ma-te-us!", the leader urged.
Unfortunately, the enthusiastic efforts of the leader have not produced the expected result.
Voter campaign in progress.
Politicians travel all over the country, convincing their constituents.
The intensive campaign is also led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is a frequent guest in the region as leader of the Silesian List of PiS.
Each meeting is scheduled precisely, including the proper fixture.
It was, and rather, in the Silesian Bakers.
It is known that a special guest should be greeted with special greetings.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, the host decided to conduct a general test.
Like a staunch leader, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
"It will not be a greeting for me, but for you, Prime Minister Matthew Morawiecki!
Also louder, my dears!" he encouraged the enthusiastic.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not able to fully capture the hot tips of the leader and reluctantly responded to "Ma-te-us", but recording enthusiastic leader makes a furo in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay house on 9 July 2014, demanding disclosure of his wife's whereabouts, Melanie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys 13 and 4 years old, and two girls 9 and 7 were killed when Haskell opened fire, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one family member, 15-year-old then Cassidy Stay, survived.
The authorities claimed she was badly injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.
The jury will reconvene on Monday to issue a verdict.
Quantum Internet closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army research are moving the quantum Internet a step closer.
Such an internet could offer military security, detection and accuracy of time-keeping capabilities that are not available at the traditional approach to networking.
The Centre for the Dissemination of Quantum Military Information Processing of the Research Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army's Possibilities was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who were able to achieve a record transfer of the state of confusion between matter and light, 50 kilometres away using fibre cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums like cubics.
When two cubes are confused and measured by one of them, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the second cubic is physically distant.
“These [50 km] are two rows of sizes further than previously possible and this is a viable distance to start building intercity quantum networks”, said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, whose findings were published in Nature magazine, Quantum Information section.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of remote nodes of the physical network of cubes, which are intertwined despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dispersion of the state of confusion is necessary for the creation of a quantum Internet.
"This demonstration is a major step forward in order to achieve a diversified state of confusion on a large scale," said Dr Sara Gamble, co-managing the military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the state of confusion on the other end is also high enough to meet some of the requirements of several of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The study team began an experiment with the atom of calcium trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser circuits, researchers entered quantum state in ion, at the same time waking it up to emit a photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were confused.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The photon emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the lighthouse," said Lanyon.
That's why his team initially sent a particle of light through a non-linear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The wavelength of photon has been converted to an optimal value from the point of view of transmission to long distances – the current standard telecommunication wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon over a 50-kilometre fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still confused even after the wavelengths had been transformed and the distance travelled.
"The decision to choose calcium means that this is a direct way to create a complex network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, since calcium can be associated with a high-quality cube of clocks."
The army is very keenly interested in complex large-scale clock networks due to applications for precise positioning, precise navigation and synchronization of time," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
