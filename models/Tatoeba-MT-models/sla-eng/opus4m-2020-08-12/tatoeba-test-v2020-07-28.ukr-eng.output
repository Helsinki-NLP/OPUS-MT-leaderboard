You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.

Put it down.

I changed my site.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
Have you been busy?
Show it to me.
Why didn't you tell Tom?
Tom won't try to do that.
Starting a fight with Tom was not such a good idea.
Tom proved that he had Liverpool in his heart.
I slipped the bed.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it wasn't there.
Let's stop this futile discussion.
Tom cleaned an apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
No one could help me do that.
You're Italian.
What's she like?
A pocket thief pulled a passport from Mark.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat on the bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come back tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom crash the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I got on the wrong bus.
I turned down this offer.
Mary had already done what she was supposed to do.
I've been watching Tom.
Did you book a table?
Where'd the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
It's like going out for a picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets to a concert until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.

I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do this alone.
You're needed here.
We ran out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in a village cannot appreciate the pleasure of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, Coke and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's all over the place.
He was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a lesbian Jew.
Last week, I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely Tom will forget how it's done.
Do you drink?
Tom's gonna do it with you?
You don't sleep?
The meeting started at five o'clock.
Mary said she liked doing it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have a decision to make today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
The Witness, who saw it all with his own eyes, is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I've been playing tennis for an hour a day.
Tom's gone.
When I walked into the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom used to press his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party was going?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what color she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I'd love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you scared?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying long?
When do you plan on going to Japan?
My kids at school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at 9:00 sharp.
Tom speaks French quite freely.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped himself dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom's leaving Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Millions of people die of hunger each year.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found the meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in chocolate.
They moved on to another religion.
I should be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he up to?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just got a haircut.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'm gonna buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so sweet.
It's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
I banged on the door.
His theory is worth the attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
That's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
That's how Tom got to be famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You were singing.
I did everything perfectly.
I like to write.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
The following month, I am sixteen years old.
Do you think there's any chance that this is going to happen?
Make peace with your dreams.
What time will your last lesson end?
I came to say good-bye, Tom.
I like that dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said I wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We have to help Tom.
It's been raining all day.
I was upset about it.
Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Keep your voice down.
The sun shines during the day and the moon shines at night.
I got up on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm having trouble with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom is likely to be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
London, I've made a lot of noise.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to conduct it.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be angry.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazil’s capital, Brazil

But the music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are fresh ones.
Tom has huge eyes.
The rainbow has seven colors.
I don't think that's why we should do this.
He's dark today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you at the fair tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
It's either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom's gonna be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
I was very tired today.
I'm true.
Happiness is not about possessing many things.
The news spread all over Japan.
Tom showed us the side of the mountain.
Taxi's here.
I heard him come down the stairs.
That's mine.
How strange!
Do you know how to read Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's clean, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Tom gave you something for me?
I could never do that without your help.
I always have coffee and snacks for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.
How was your exam?
Can I pay you later?
Is that what just happened?
Mary didn't take her umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
To tell you the truth, I lied.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me some tweezers?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too ashamed.
I went into the details.
Tom said he didn't want to do it.
Let's go to the oceanrium.
Do you know what the cause of the problem is?
Where's Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
Today I have a good appetite.
We're comfortable in our new house.
There are only two boundless things in the world, the universe and human stupidity.
She said, "I'm very happy."

Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how are you?
The password is "Muiriel."
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take out the trash.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!

I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.

Answer right now.
I had a suspicion that Tom was missing home.
Tom hasn't done that since last year.
Are you done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?

The dog's name is Ken.
I've been fair.
When did I lie?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to draw cards.
He's a scoundrel.
What's a computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What do you recommend?
Tom decided to do it.
Your meds are ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, it's everyone's, isn't it?
I was so excited that I couldn’t sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Do I seem nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tom’s house is Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He asked himself why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar on it.
Do you know how to skate?
I know how to do that.
Tom was breast-feeding?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
I baked Tato pie.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What does Tom do in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom and Mary said they weren't sick.
I have plenty of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy making dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
You better get back here.
He's incompetent.
Foma's been practicing.
He's intolerable.
He's sure he'll pass the exam.
Tom voted in favour of the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do this?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
The prospects aren't too bright.
I do not believe in anything supernatural, but I am fascinated by the devil’s literary poem.
The trouble is, she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom will actually go to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the last weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm a DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Is the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
A child was lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Talk to me.
The surface of an air balloon is an inequitable space, so it does not comply with the rules of Euclid geometry.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I've been trying to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and direct.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I dropped the ball.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming languages are his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So I don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My tie's orange.
Tom's gonna cry?
That's why I'd like to be taller.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's walking.
Tom's not in town.
My shoes wore off.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in a yellow dress.
Love tastes bad.
The meeting is over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I have an old machine.
We understand why.
I drive every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's go to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went into the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything else.
He was chasing a thief.
I worked at a restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat right now.
The fragments of the mirror were scattered over the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She went to school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is just like the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I should do this.
Government debt is on the rise.
Why am I me and not you?
Tom's probably never gonna do that.
It's a doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't go through with this.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't need to.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather like?
I'm 30 years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you have for lunch today?
You can't even change diapers.
People still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she quit school.
It's a Greek word borrowed.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
My brother's sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There's no rules.
Leila got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad out of raw fish?
Tom knew Mary knew.
Tom's making breakfast.
There is no doubt that it will rain.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than I am.
Better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He readily answered my question.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When's she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did that yesterday.
Tom still lives next door?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw away the stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in a year of two thousand years.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It must be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a short peace, war broke out again.
It's better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?
The capital city of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you pass me the sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" - "On the chair."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Did Tom crash?
You need a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing soccer.
How does it work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'll fix your shirt.
When is his return expected?
I've had a good rest.
He's as good as his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be nice if it was 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We do not expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom's out of the room.
I still do it every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He's, like, a human robot.
Answer the question!
You're needed at the hospital.
I can't find a suture.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He was tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, it was the Grand Prae.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we should not do this again.
They've lived there for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she is away.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
Do you want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I've scored thirty points.
If I don't, Tom will get mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
A large tree fell on the road, and as I drove, it blocked my path.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom's been blind since he was born.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student and he's not.
That's what I was trying to do.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sleigh.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my little sister Sakiko, born that same year as me, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you finished your homework?
Monday is likely to be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help him paint the fence.
Why do humans act like great apes, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should see a doctor.
I put the papers on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The rope broke when we went upstairs.
Tom's driving.
If you had less hamburgers, you would probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want some ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how it's done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Shut the door.
I won't speak French to Tom.
The apple from the apple doesn't fall far.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father’s brother or mother’s.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this to you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
Do you think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
Let's go. Let's go.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare to him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you figure that out?
She committed suicide.
We equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay early.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to get my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom's gonna do it right now.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become a subject of criticism.
That's gonna be genius.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
It's much worse.
I'm under a fly.
You didn't waste any time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know many French teachers.
You don't look anything like her.
Can you play the violin?
Can I have some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He himself was popular both among the students and among the teachers.
You can't help with the tears of grief.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go anywhere you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up.
I'll be back soon.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's on the phone with you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking to a Esperante with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady’s suitor.
I'll take care of it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I beautiful?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let Tom move you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom pulled up Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He's back at the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
Language mediums subconsciously follow the rules of their own language without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their guns at the elephant.
No one's worried.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I'd like to take the money.
I'm shaking Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom voted?
I'll be back.
Tom won't make Mary do it.
Tom started spinning.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your vacation?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I'm still a little homesick, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have memory problems.
Where's Mom?
He regained consciousness three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi here?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
It's going to be difficult.
Does Tom always act like that?
I like playing golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk that loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She dumped him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So I felt sorry for Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom checks his phone all the time.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on rocking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She's totally ignoring me.
Tom's going to a party tonight.
I told you.
She was on her way to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was gonna happen?
What's up?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, it can be likened to a plastic tree that has been created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized that I'm not in love with you.
Did you tell Because I was kidding?
That's why it was so boring.
Tom said I was pretty.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
There's a lot I have to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take out the trash.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom was reluctant to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have any headaches?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play outside with his friends.
Whatever happens, just stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my baby.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
Doing so was much more difficult than it seemed.
Her friends mocked her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
Aliens are flying in and taking our jobs.
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Will you take the train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
Is that why you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
Doing so was much more difficult than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I got better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do that.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, I'm taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You seemed interested.
It'll help.
I'm going to sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken's got two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I like the rides.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in sunglasses.
Tom's a good painter.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I get a rented Halloween suit?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting a fever.
Why aren't you asleep?
Tom actually thinks someone's listening?
You don't have to give up!
Tom, I think he's pretty.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should have gone earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a cold spot.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do I say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an intolerable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, it's impeccable.
I am very interested in studying French.
It's good for the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit that, don't you?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
I'm not clean.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I'm telling you everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom ever talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Aren't you going to buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did?
Did you do it?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
I'm a pretty good dancer.

We can pay.
I think I did it wrong.
I'm looking for a book for the kids.
I doubt Tom's coming.
He doesn't care what others say.
Tom caught the ball.
Why is life so difficult?
Some people are very tense.
I don't know how old Tom is.
Mary was the only girl in the club.
That's a difficult problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?
I told him to speak French.
Tom's a teacher, isn't he?
Tom's surprised.
I tried to help you.
I didn't try.
No one's taking me to work.
Don't you want to have children?
Tea without ice.
Philosophy is not something you can learn in six months.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom thought no one was watching.
My father's too busy to go for a walk.
This place is worth visiting twice.
I'm just going for a walk.
He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
Did you live here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do this.
Tell him I'll call him back.
We'll try.
Tom shared Mary’s pain.
They're tired of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
I don't like fish.
I'm not who I think I am.
I feel tired.
I have food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive the car.
Tom’s excuse was pitiful.
Warsaw is cheaper than London?
I'm ashamed of my bad English.
Are you hungry?
How did you get out of prison?
You can't prove anything.
You're a success.
I have a guinea pig.
Your lips are blue.
Who did you go dancing with?
Thank you, I've downloaded all six files.
Tom died of tuberculosis in 2013.
Good job!
My cat is so cute.
I like cake.
He looks exhausted.
Look, here comes your train.
This watch is mine.
What are you looking for?
Life is beautiful.
It wasn't easy.
Do you like chocolate milk?
You're a ghost?
You have restored my faith in mankind.
How's your mother?
He doesn't believe in evolution.
I hurt my back.
Where did you work last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
Tom would be very proud of you.
He came here himself.
I really want to eat.
Tom died that same year as Mary.
We went out on the street.
I think exams spoil education.
It's very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Did Tom believe that?
In fact, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober then.
Here's your pitch.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First of all, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he gets here.
Tom knows how to drive.
I read novels at random.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up around 6:00.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if that's why you can trust me.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I got angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
What's up, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win the Eurowave.
Where could Tom have done that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You're free to go.
Tom said I wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
How would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
This is Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I making myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom will probably be punished for doing this.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come on in.
Tom can be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
That's really silly.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's always contradicting herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth moved from father to son.
No roses without spikes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, garage?
Surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He abandoned his family.
Let's go?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I shaved.
I'm the boss.
Tom had a good time.
You should be home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did it.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
Each student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what they can sue me for.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
It's out of my hands.
Tom speaks French well.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Dad, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botanist.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom.
The congregations went pretty well.
This time of year, the wind blows from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat this bully.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did it.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings country music better than any of my friends.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased opinion is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
It's important.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's at Tom's.
Tom was barefoot.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't make it.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
I'm crying. You don't cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love can't be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What is this theater?
Have you seen the protein?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate weddings.
I heard the front door slam.
I'm not following you.
Mary dances beautifully.
My grandfather is from Osaka.
I want a massage, I need to relax.
Tom's such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Have you been able to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think when Tom's here?
Is it going to snow tonight?
Does that sound fun to you?
Are you seeing anyone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she ever do anything for me?
I had an orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know that was going to happen?
Bad thoughts give birth to bad things.
Did you bring a fan?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a withdrawal from this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't do without water.
I can't think straight.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste any time.
Give me a hint.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He's had a lot to drink.
Tom says he's happy.
How are you feeling right now?
How many guys in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do such a thing?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers will save us time.
Do not interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We're getting married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the bones away.
The book lacked several pages.
I raised the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks his promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Each student has his own party.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom doesn't have a thirst.
I learned to milk a cow.
I'm full.
Too bad I'm not rich.
The news upset her deeply.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see for yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
How do you pronounce your name?
She's got the flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's in his 90s.
This coffee is so hot, I can't drink it.
Where did you get this?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I have your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten bucks.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did she help you?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You haven't seen him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much is this umbrella worth?
They were both different.
What happened?
This can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom’s class was infected with the flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Did Tom get hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word - silver, silence - gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love that T-shirt.
Drink the water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom may still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't mind her whimsies.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
You like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does that take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom does?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
This is the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I'm asleep.
How is this my fault?
As far as Switzerland is concerned, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It got better.
I'm studying Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window's open.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom had a pretty sick look when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me take care of this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Get him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting there.
Tom has a moustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've met Tom several times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary are doing a lot of things together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench in red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You don't speak French, do you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home.
I said hi to Tom.
Tom took off his ring.
I'm having you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke that window?
Your ideas are a little out of date.
