The new guy helped Trabzonspor to second place, and Škoda also hit.
The defender Filip Novák helped the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to become a deputy minister.
His team won 2:1 at the Kayserispor field and kept the third Besiktas behind.
After the January crossing from Slavia, the attacker Milan Škoda had already given the tenth goal for Riespora, which he saved, even though he had surrendered 1:3 at Fenerbahce.
Newbie confirmed excellent productivity in defense with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech football player fired a ball into the net from an angle.
The housewives were able to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute the setting pulled the win on his side when he successfully finished the four-on-one break.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce compensated after the solo at 1:1.
Riespor did not hold an indecisive state for long, but unfortunately it did not have to, for the results of the rivals left three points above the descent zone behind.
The competition will end Sunday duel of the Basaksehir Master in the Kasimpasa Playground.
The well-secreted Cave in the forests of Nový Bor was not actually inhabited
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, near Nova Bora to Czechoslovakia, in the forests led by the Counting Road, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificial.
And we will follow the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave by the hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hidden chamber apparently on the grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rock’s guard and accessible on the stairs above.
But until the last moment, it's virtually invisible.
It will be betrayed until the narrow steps leading to a rock gallery, from which it is just entering the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far from human habitation, at the time of creation it could have been on the upper platform, where the forest is today, a field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window and even a traditional place located in a melting place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podružek of the Faculty of Philosophy of John Evangelist Purkin in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench in the back, apparently for the disposal of the vessels.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podružek.
There's evidence of tool marks on the cave walls.
Breaking the sand with a tipping point was quite simple and fast for those dedicated.
It was appropriate to use the spar and to break the sandstone gradually.
According to the length of the tip and the method of cutting, the period of formation of the cave can be determined in a framework.
According to historians, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes a sleepover there in modern times.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest trails and take you under a cave running stream and a nearby county road, you will certainly find a path down there too.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be caught by the nearby Havrani rocks.
Jakok Minarík is in an artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip's in the best hands now.
The Institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately, we have a family in Hanover.
This greatly facilitates the situation and also the care of the daughter of Finland," said the server Jezci.cz of Minarík's wife Katji's statement.
"Everyone's doing the best they can, Philip needs time to reconvene.
It doesn't make sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of head trauma and sleep patients knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said a woman of five-year-old jockey.
In order to support the injured Minarík, he also called on Twitter star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, thus levelling the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been selected on the Gofundme server.
The target is €100,000 (2.6 million).
The video referee took four goals to Sassuola football players, lost 0:2
The Sassuola footballers, although in a Saturday match in Naples, scored four times in the rival goal, but eventually they had to accept defeat 0:2.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consulting the video because of the offset.
According to the Italian media, it's a record threat to technology, so many attacks have never been made before by VAR to one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him as no team yet.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"The festival of unrecognizable Sassuola goals.
He has never been so strict on one team before," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead at eight o'clock on Saturday, but after half an hour of the game, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
But Philip Djuricič's goal was not recognized after the video referee's intervention because of the offsad.
For the same reason, Djuricič’s next hit and scores of Francesco Caputa and Domenica Berardi were not paid.
On the contrary, the housewives added another goal.
The electric cars are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, it was the most in history.
"The growth has been driven by both a 30 per cent increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as an accelerated development of registrations of new e-auts," CEZ chief Tomáš Chmelík said.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the Tesla electric car manufacturer, as well as supermarkets Bill and Lidl, report their share on the market.
The owners of the classic pumping stations are again represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"Our electricity network started building only last year," explained the speaker of Jan Jusková.
However, the daily edition exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It turns out that the drivers from the stations took on an average of 13,5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometres of a smaller electric car.
If we forget a small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average charging of two and a half hours.
The crushing majority of the refueling then took place on free tariffs.
If the motorists had already paid for the collection, their typical loss was about 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly involved in the capital.
In the territory of Prague are all five of the most burdensome chargers of the company ČEZ, which will be overshadowed by the popularity of the entire regional cities.
Olomouc leads the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border, for example in Bohumin or Prachatice, which often remain unused all day.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
During this first semester alone, 1,274 new e-cars arrived.
In a large-scale survey of the daily Czechs in motion, eight percent of readers said that they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
Only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organisers, the government's current steps in the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, and speakers have called for a more diverse approach.
Events called Last Drop were attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as by smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who are long-standing against the expansion of the Lower Turov, there are people who are opposed to the mining of gravel at the Uher Ostroh, there are people who stand up against the construction of meaningless dams," Marika Wolf said.
It stated that the main requirements of the protestors are the establishment of a plan for water retention in the province, a significant change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies towards support for sustainable agriculture and the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of people, not the ruthless and destructive business," she said.
A stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech State was placed on the Malostránské square to plant the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The present people were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of the beehive dump" or "Minor of coal, more mannequins".
From South Moravia to Prague came Jan Škoda from the association for water for people who protest against the plan of mining gravel in Hodonínsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that drilling represents the fifth most valuable source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned mining of gravel is estimated to be only 500 metres from the wells and it is estimated that water quality will be compromised.
For the so-called agro-ecological farmer, he came from the village of Valez to Karlovy Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to the logs of small farms that do not marry for profits and profits and supply the inhabitants directly to the site.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population perfectly normally, and on top of that they do not cause such destruction in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash to a house in Germany
Three people died today when an ultralight plane fell on an apartment house in western Germany and two others were injured.
Local rescue supplies reported this, likely involving two crew members and one resident of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Local fire chief Robert Meyer reported that both crew members of the plane had apparently died.
The third victim, according to the police, is the woman who lived in the house.
Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote with reference to Mayor Wessel that it was the mother of a self-sufficient woman whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the crash, which apparently served as a barrier to landing.
The police assume it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine launched from an airport in the nearby city of Marl.
Rheinische Post reported with reference to eyewitnesses that the plane crashed with a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, with reference to other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before impacting the ground.
The Czech savings office mistakenly charged some payments by card twice on Saturday.
She's already removed the bug.
The Czech savings office mistakenly charged its clients on Saturday afternoon some payments with a card twice.
According to the spokesman for Lukas Kropik's bank, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
She's already taken the money out of the money and returned it to her clients.
The problems with double-accounting of card payments were recorded in savings on Saturday afternoon.
"We updated the system last night (on Saturday) and immediately returned all these double payments to our customers.
At this moment everything works without problems," Kropik said Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients the bank has deducted from card payments twice, the bank's spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, it was less than a thousand transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated in an orderly manner.
"It could be a combination of several factors," said Kropik.
Czech savings facility is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
She had 4.6 million at the end of March.
The savings company is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, Vojtěch will present a three-stage system against coronavir
"They will be at regional level according to the strength of the community.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in ČT.
It will be a light, each region will be marked with a green, orange or red colour according to the risk of coronavir.
The minister added that he would talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian Silesian region would currently have orange color and that Prague would be close to it.
The map will also contain individual measures for regional health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this at regional level because the situation in these regions is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Sergeant and Karolina
When Sergeant Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolinka look at each other, they don't have a simple one.
Jonah's father, the naughty sergeant Hastrbuch, has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not human.
Fortunately, there's a young Libor who'll do anything to protect the whole village, and especially Caroline, from that water bug.
What if he's going to tease and lie?
Especially if she can get Karolina Jonah to reject and give priority to him, a good Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone who can drown the midnight kettle, the broken flour, the fire of the mill and other lottery tickets.
The indignant villagers will organize a race for the waterman, and an incomprehensible water curse will come upon Jonah’s head.
And now Conveyor's sweetheart, Caroline, please!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince his neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah, and deliver him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in ČT studies and in exteriors near the pond Brzin, in Obděnice na Sedlčansk and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

Most of the disease is mild, only three percent of those infected must go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavir is spreading to the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun significantly improved our immunity.
The hospital's infectious wards are half empty even though the number of infected people is growing.
"This situation today and in April is completely different and is given primarily by the number of hospitalised people," confirmed Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding us that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic broke in, they wore all the robes, the army carried out the receipts, the republic was closed and the Czech Republic consumed the disinfection for the year ahead.
Yet, ten people died a day.
Now, daily increases in the number of infected people are higher, but every day with covid-19, at least two people die.
The highest number of infected people still has Karvinska, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's Centre, where there are 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another senior school home was closed in Czernožice on Královéhradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests in one of the nurses.
"We are travelling, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the director of the retirement home, Martin Schaniel.
According to him, none of the home clients have any signs of illness yet.
Flat testing will start hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals also respond to an increased number of infected people.
Oncology Institute in Brno launched an automatic camera system today at the entrance to see if people have a cloth on their way in.
The record reports South Bohemian hygiene, which recorded twenty-five cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign workers of the Prachatian company.
Overall, 131 infected people arrived on Saturday - that is, half the Friday count - but less is tested on the weekend.
A champion contestant!
Van den Bergh wrote a story, Anderson trashed
A big surprise tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh presented excellent performance even in a match with a player who was the second most prestigious company in the PDC won in 2018.
The introduction of the match was both sides balanced, the break came in state 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-breath leg, and he's been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and the "Flying Scot" was hard to get to the doves.
The way in which "Dreammaker" had it in a handful also indicates that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th place.
In addition, the young Belgian handled excellent high checkouts.
Last time he lost his 11th position, in an unfavourable condition, he caught a big fish and closed 170.
At the end of the match, there was enormous frustration at Anderson.
The rods were just thrown away, and his triumphant opponent was acting completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh transformed immediately the first of three match darts and received his name - he wrote his great dream.
The profit of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian darter that it is his first winning major.
It still stands to reason that the last player to defeat the van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
A charge fell in Nantes over the cathedral fire, the man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th - century windows and destroyed the organs.
Suspects of arson were investigated by investigators because of the fire that followed the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police at the entrances found no sign of anyone getting violently into the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 29-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without starting a prosecution.
Now the D.A. reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again Saturday, confessed and faced arson charges.
If found guilty, he is threatened with up to ten years in prison and a high sentence.
According to his lawyer, the man of the crime regrets and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday, we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to play the role of the pandemic plan, which is why the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"They will gradually be according to the power of community distribution," the minister explained.
He added that, for example, the Moravian Silesia region or Prague would now reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, as the situation in the individual regions varies significantly, complemented.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute for Health Information and Statistics (USIS).
Specific measures will, according to the Minister, be established, whether it is the obligation to wear clothes or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for clear information on what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by noting that there is no need to talk about declaring a state of emergency or recalling a crisis headquarters.
In view of the increasing number of infected persons since Saturday in the Czech Republic, the government again introduced the obligation to wear dresses at internal events of more than 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now making up 1,000 people.
The government procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when they would start to apply and when they would be announced, was subject to criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create a sense of security and counter the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilsher in Questions.
The measures may already vary according to the region, for example, in Prague from Sunday to Sunday there is an obligation to wear robes in non-resident medical facilities, such as in pharmacies or waiting rooms in the doctor’s office.
The obligation to wear robes when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced since Friday in the Liberec and Ustec region.
In the Highlands of Jihlava it is necessary to wear dresses in internal public spaces, in the MHD and in health facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian Silesia region, the anti-epidemic measures have been released, as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
By early June, the Czech Government had also approved a so-called European Semester, which in colour distinguishes the level of risk of disease in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities have not required a negative test of the coronary virus for Czech citizens since 15 June or have not ordered quarantine instead.
They are required to return Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are in the low-risk category of diseases.
The technoparty in Benešovsk is continuing.
She's playing third capacity, she was supposed to end up at noon.
Head of Lhota (Benešovska) Technoparty near Hlaváčky Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
Still playing a third of the original 12 musical systems.
According to the police's estimate at 8:00 p.m., there are about 500 people left, the original gross estimates were three hundred, the morning was 900, said police spokesman Lucie Nováková.
Initially, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, and at that time, the actual part of the music systems shut down.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still in part.
We expect that it will gradually disconnect and analyze the music systems," Novaková said.
"Police continue to scrutinise outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to submit to preventive breath tests before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of law enforcement officers on the scene, foreign police, traffic and order police, and there are also dogs with service dogs on standby.
"During today, the police checked 470 people moving at the scene of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six were seated behind the alcohol-influenced steering wheel," Novaková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for drugs and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also solved 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants, the technopartes carried out 300 preventive respiratory tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't been reduced, the police would have intervened.
On the TV show Prima Party said Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) Interior Minister Jan Hamáček.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention and neither did the health station nor the health ministry ask for it.
Czech TV (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty has also expanded to surrounding land whose owners did not agree to use for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will require compensation for the damage.
Technicians arrived at Hlavák's Lhota on Friday night.
The police were originally guarding the harbor in Blažima in Benešovsk on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blajim is located about 30 km from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the technicians actually landed.
According to Novak, no one came to Blajimi.
Snake sting: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in iron ore.
Snakes there pummeled the girl, the year 2010 which the parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," the regional health care spokesman Maria Svobodová told Dnieku that the child was then transferred to the hospital in Klatov.
Snakes are the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in the Forest that these animals occur in a higher number, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake will bite you isn't too high, she's afraid of herself when she's in regular contact.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away for a loud suction.
They will only attack if they feel very threatened - for example if you accidentally step on it.
Even her stinging is not a tragedy, although her poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is mainly for children, seniors and allergics.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea after being stricken, in the case of weakened individuals and particularly allergics, there may be anaphylaxis," she told Diník Miriam Gredová from Klatov Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the babies out of the window.
After the policeman poured wine and threw the dishes
After 11:00, an intervention unit entered the apartment, and the men were detained.
Breeders were immediately taken into the care of the medics, a spokesman for the regional police, Markéta Janovská, said in a press report.
The man didn't want to work with the cops, he threw dishes, knives, or pour them out of the window with wine after the police negotiator.
During the negotiations, he strengthened his threats by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
He even climbed out of the window one day, where he roared.
The police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosur will give her daughter a head start before tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur won't be able to interfere with the coronary affected season this year.
The 60-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, yet doesn't want to end her career.
For next year, he plans to return to the courts and believes that his family and daughter will be able to enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I will stay home, I will spend time with my family, I will be with all those little milestones that our Evie will spend the next six months and I will just enjoy it," the former world leader said on the Australian Union website on four games.
WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season of 3 August with an Antuk tournament in Palermo from March.
Market Sapa: Russia has discovered meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area carried 1,320 pieces of crochet eggs of unknown origin, in addition in inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish stand, it was found that the seller had no proof of origin of the goods and was not registered for sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view over the long term.
For example, last fall, the veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, containing almost half a tonne of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For the majority, it was not possible to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had an expiry date and was damaged.
For five kilograms of herring, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterans with police officers in the market area held 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, part of which was moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky before the truce in Donbas, the Kremlin criticises the planned election
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he is scheduled to start paying for a new truce from midnight.
Putin, according to a statement by the Kremlin, criticised, inter alia, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new peace of arms with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The truce is due to begin at midnight on Monday night, to be "complete and general" and to open the way for further provisions of peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin said in an interview with Zelenski that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise local elections opposes the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens prospects for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the planned elections to the local representatives would not take place in the territory of the pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the borders of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to the Union agency, the Green Office stated that the two states agreed on the benefits of the upcoming peace truce in Donbas and the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region, such as the decommissioning of areas of combat or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimea peninsula and in Russia itself.
The mine deal helped stop the fighting, but people continue to die in occasional shootings and artillery attacks on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West are blaming Russia for the military support of separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made the end of the war in Donbas a priority, but there has not been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected master in the tenth fight is Rykl, 7th battle was ruled by Novotná
The lawyer of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the Saturday program of the four hundredth century, Kopecký did not jump the ground in the pole on Sunday.
For ten years, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coaches of Josef Karas, ruled for the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside MČR so far, this time he was the only ten-man who got across the 7,000 border.
Other medals were won behind him by Vilém Straský and Petr Urbanek.
After the competition, Rykl reminded Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora of the absence.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start because that would look completely different.
But the title tastes really good, especially when I put a 30-centimeter persono in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the bar and most disappointed about the disc, there I was medium," he admitted on the union Facebook.
On the first day of the seventh fight, Kateřina Cach won with more than one hundredths, although she was tormented by an injured ankle on a reflection leg.
In the remote sector, however, she then recorded only 570 cm, did not pass the spear 40 meters, and did not enter the final eight.
Novotna collected 5878 points and won 241 points before Kateřina Dvořáková.
She came out first, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it were around the 630.
Yesterday I started pulling the lever, but I am so glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotna said on the union Facebook.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or oil, given significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also found in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But this is all new - the European market first appeared before last year, and according to a press release by the Czech Association LPG arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we have received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping stations in combination with the classic fossil LPG," Jiří Karlík quoted Primagas as saying.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the Association, the chemical side is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which is now being refueled into its cars by a number of motorists.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to classical LPG is the method of production," says bio LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the association.
This is also said to be one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and cane sugar.
In the future, it should also be produced with a purpose, e.g. from cellulose biomass, or wood waste.
In contrast, classical LPG is partly produced as a by-product when refining oil, partly by separation in natural gas production.
Therefore, depending on the production technology and sources, the operation of the car to bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation to oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, so called "well-to-tank" (Czech "source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently belongs to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also explores the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates from the Czech Association, about 170,000 vehicles drive LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports in the NAP ČM a slightly higher number, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 car transfers were made last year alone to the LPG drive.
To refuel LPG is possible in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojciech revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronary virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon's number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
Thus, there are currently 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"According to the leaping increase in the number of cures is the revision of data that has not been updated recently by hygiene," said health statistics chief Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people had been infected in the Czech Republic, 11,419, and 371 Covid-19 had unfortunately fallen.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence choices.
Politician and sociologist were looking for alternatives to the pandemic.
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), the amendment of the law is also necessary for people in quarantine to vote in the October regional and Senate elections for the cause of coronavir.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at the Prima Television Party.
On Tuesday, the Ministry wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
The Minister said, however, that the provisions of the law would need to be amended so that people in quarantine cannot vote for health reasons.
The prohibition should be maintained for example for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM show that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction to the vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because according to experience from abroad it would rather be recorded by other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overrated.
It is therefore against the possibility of electronic voting, where abuse is a significant possibility.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary ad hoc to invent mechanisms (wills) that could be implemented this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main one is to be prepared for the year 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The correspondence choice (either abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As others, they see the electoral units mentioned above or, for example, the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavir - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections in 67 countries have been postponed this year due to the spread of coronary disease.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig's Ears Throw Protesters at Government Building · Global Voices
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another of a series of protests against the "mafian style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organisers are planning on Wednesday's national blockade, the DPA said.
Today's protest, which has already taken place on the 18th day after itself, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom had less participation than before.
By 20:00 there were about 300 people, some streets had to be closed for transport.
Demonstrators in front of the government's building played a theatre scene in which they symbolically imprisoned Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Gesev in connection with the arrest of two advisors to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Both resignations are among the basic requirements of the protestors.
They also demanded the lifting of the announced reform of health care and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organiser of the protests Nikolaj Hadžigenov said in a public broadcast today that Wednesday "the peak of escalation" in the form of "the entire national event in Sofia and the blockades throughout the country" is coming.
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as for early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had previously said that he was not going to resign.
He justified, inter alia, the need to carry out Bulgaria with the covidu-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, even though the resignation of the protestor did not calm down.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped voting on confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovich doesn't want no more games without viewers.
Football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovich already has enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadium from the new season.
"What we are currently doing here is not football.
I've already got my teeth full of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks I am," Mihajlovich said before today's fight against Lecca.
After the Coronavir break follow the series A matches in a quick sequence, and despite playing until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
Under such conditions, they don't even know how the teams are on it.
Just so this season's over.
These measures had to be taken to complete the competition, but I hope that fans will be back by September," said the coach, who led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlović, this season is also unusual because he was missing four months on the bench for treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else managed to move our team to a level higher.
We want to keep growing and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials stated that the fire that broke out in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musaví told reporters according to Iranian media that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" daily.
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would be able to reflect.
In the past months, according to Musávi, several major cyber attacks have been recorded, which were based on analyses by "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not give any further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
This month, an article by the Iranian State Agency, IRNA, discussed that the enemies of Iran, like Israel and the United States, could have been behind recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly charged with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States suspended diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held for 444 days as hostages 52 Americans.
Long-standing intense relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US Army killed Iranian General Kasem Solejmani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on 3 January.
Iran then fired on the bases in Iraq on 8 January, where Americans operate, the amount of missiles.
The U.S. has admitted with a distance that dozens of American soldiers have been injured.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 International Nuclear Agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA's car has extended production outage, now until 25 May
Cologne car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has renewed production withdrawal due to coronavir.
The production lines should start again on Monday 25 May morning.
The race will accompany dozens of hygiene measures, said car speaker Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has been due to a coronary pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
The company originally intended to restore it on Monday 18 May.
The reason for the extension of the withdrawal is according to Paroubka closed borders and closed dealers, so the cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. for two shifts.
Coronavir affects the key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that TPCA’s production is not signed in the city’s life.
"From the beginning it was known, in the city it was empty.
But the streets are gradually filling up, especially now since Monday, when it's been very loose.
So the city is full," Kashpar said.
According to him, there are no complications either with foreign workers who stayed at hostels.
"In the last two months, we didn't have to solve almost any problem," said Kashpar.
For example, Mladoboleslavska Škoda Auto, which also interrupted production due to the coronary crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works on 100 percent of the capacity.
The renewal of production in Škoda accompanied more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday, on Tuesday, in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasin, for the first time since the renewal of the production took place the third, i.e. the night shift.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employers in Kolínsk.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson's cancer was fought, and when the cancer seemed to have gone away, the disease came back.
A 19 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a bed in a hospice where she could still take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, the infirmity has fallen.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her social networking account for the loved ones.
Gemma Sisson from English Leeds loved bodybuilding.
With a friend Ricky Moore, who lived with her for over 16 years, they traveled around the world after competitions.
Ninety-year-old woman sports and lived healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma started an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping she'd get better.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
A cultural and personal trainer, according to British daily Daily Mirror, performed a ten-hour spinal surgery and then resumed with drastic treatment.
Of course, it was all in vain.
Early this year, on her ninetieth birthday, the doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to go to a pub in Leeds, where her family visited her every moment, even organizing a wedding with her love for Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma's last two-month anniversary to the restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a social networking account revealed a contribution that Gemma wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although my heart will be broken that I'm leaving my loved ones here, I'd be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote to the social network, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network followers," she said, saying that everyone should respect their lives and live it to the full.
Machines for art sell sweatshirts, amulets from music and pexo
For a hundred crowns he gets the passing pocket work mostly of the beginning Czech artists.
The images and other creations are created directly for the arthmat, so they know in advance that they must fit into the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signaled.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself," said the curator of the Petra Widžová project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
A buyer can thus be surprised by the artistic work he obtains.
Currently, he may become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Staplová or miniviews from Teresa Bonaventure, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutkov, prepared a peseta associated with the walk of Prague.
Cards should be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladroová and Juliana Chomová sell pocket packages of spiritity: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet of trinket and fortune-telling cards, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritist.
Health payments will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
The higher the increase according to Vojtěch is unrealistic
Health payments could rise by up to five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Questions Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The requirement of experts to increase by up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aids.
According to him, the hospital now has their supplies.
"I think the increase (payments) could be up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, the current situation should be taken into account when, since March, she intervened in the selection of the Coronavir Insurance pandemic and the Government Regulation against its spread.
The income of the insurance companies at the time fell.
"A 15 per cent increase at this point seems unrealistic," said Wojciech.
The average monthly income of a doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (USIS) is likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, sisters 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to CZK 7,000.
Data also indicate that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34 125 in 2019 according to the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, the union officials said that for 2021 they would require a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the salaries of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by payment tables, and contractual wages in hospitals, districts or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that the payment tables be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, in doctors last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber of Roman Schmucler, trade unionists should be aware of the state of the art.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's budget deficit of CZK 500 billion due to the effects of the cod epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to be paid to health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Care Providers, according to Schmuckler, disagrees with the flat salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals themselves and medical facilities themselves, and the money should go to them through the pay order.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have sufficient protective facilities.
President of the State Reserve Management (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any health care.
Waiting for the completion of the selection proceedings.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
A shivering smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they're telling
"Smart quarantine works, it is something to improve of course.
We're going to discuss with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly and the question is whether they shouldn't be driving the whole thing again," the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show Chau people.
According to him, it is not possible to connect IT systems and hygienic stations sufficiently, which must gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in the Moravian Silesia region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Minister Jan Pejšek's spokesman for the Czech Republic said he had no information on Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
He thinks the army is ready for this move.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, a smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team established under the military as an advisory body of the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The shuddering project was criticised on Sunday by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He also suggested that he could be reinstated by the army.
The shortcomings in the project were previously accepted by the government authority for IT and digitisation Vladimír Jurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it's still working.
Twenty years it's been self- and non-systemic, now we're trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not gonna work.
The people on the march, the poor on the hygienists on the march adapt the new systems and actually capture the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Prime Minister Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "fool in politics"
Current Istrian Prime Minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the attempt "not to fool around in politics," said the Respekt.cz server.
Mr Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the YES Movement, has been the recipient of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the leading ANO candidates won almost a third of the vote in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last one term of office, and with that business experience, I could turn everything around at that time and put it on my feet," said Respect.
He added that for the second election period, he was allowed to negotiate to a certain extent.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in this policy," added Macura, who in the interview referred to himself as a heavy introvert who doesn't have frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, Macur's possible end in the YES movement has been speculated for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the YES movement, for example for an alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zeman’s opponent, Jiří Dragoš.
From the YES movement he entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is bothering me, I have no immediate motive to end it," said Respect.
Sixty-five-year-old Macura studied at the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming an Istrian primacy in 2014, Macura acted, inter alia, as the director of the Walmark pharmaceutical company.
He also met in other companies' bodies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, offering transport services.
This is a consequence of the amendment of the law, according to a press statement by the Brno Council for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) on Thursday.
Anti-Uber in Brno was protested by taxi drivers, indicating that Uber did not meet the conditions such as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, the conditions for operating conventional taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
In recent weeks, he has held several meetings with Uber representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is a consequence of a change in the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or missing taxi meter.
The court issued preliminary measures prohibiting Uber from riding in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, last year at the end of the year, but Prime Minister Markét Vaníková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to subsequent court decisions, Uber was able to drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, it has been possible to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications with a light and a taxi meter.
Too much party in Brno: flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
On the fourth floor of the apartment, the office chair flew out of Brno on Saturday night and fell about a metre from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the officers.
As soon as she arrived at the address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window under which there were still chairs and several cans and bats.
"The movement from the room on the fourth floor suggested that a relatively loud celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went up the hall to the apartment and asked three young men present at the age of sixty-six to twenty-nine years for an explanation," said Officer James Ganem.
Request for appeal Rafaje will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss a request Monday with the coalition social Democrats for an appeal by the head of the antitrust office (UOHS) Peter Rafaje.
Non-profit organisations have been called upon to appeal to Rafa at the meetings of the anti-corruption council of the government and the Ustec region.
Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, according to the law, he cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is under the authority of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar requirement from the Ustec Region.
Among other things, Rafa’s cause has been to be due to recent events.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request that the materials be introduced and that the government parties take a "certain view".
He also stated that the challenge had not yet been addressed by the president, and he did not have a meeting with him shortly.
According to the UOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
IHNED.cz and Current.cz servers said last week that the police are interested in Rafajo's meetings with Haytman Jiří Chunk.
The meetings brought together, inter alia, the decision on the competition for the project of the controversial new Zlin hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly advocates.
The party admitted, according to him, that his "senal activities" were dealt with together.
Rafai speaks similarly.
The representative of the Ustec Region called on the government to appeal Rafa at the end of June.
It also requests reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the UOHS regarding public contracts according to the Deputy Hejtman for the transport of Jaroslav Kominka is not transparent and has signs of will.
Last March, the police intervened with the antitrust office because of a tender to choose a myth.
This June, the server Aktuálna.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written on an influential behind-the-satellite player ČSSD Alexandra Čuba.
A $3.5 million deposit on an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition has been Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa's second six-year term expires.
The Anti-Monopolitan Authority Act states that the President may refer the President of the Office to a proposal from the Government.
It may only be revoked if it has not performed a function for more than six months or has seriously violated the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blanche Library, the employees collapsed in heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news to me.
Three children and I go to a library in central Blanca regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to endure there.
There was terrible heat and bad air.
The wind didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of the Blaenne readers Peter Novotný.
According to the director of the Lukas Tawpa Library, temperatures in the building often rose to over 30 degrees Fahrenheit [30 ° C].
The southern wall of the building is glassy and works like a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun is based on the curvature of the building for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to blow up because overnight windows must be closed for security reasons.
We often have this from morning in the library to 30 degrees," Zapa said.
The worst part was the study and the reading room on the third floor.
And on the floor above the exhibition room and the principal.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes the librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incapacitated.
The problem was also regularly encountered in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there," Zapa noted.
Initially, the city's representatives wanted to do air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most problematic spaces.
The studio and the reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," Jiří Svoboda of the blaenne investment union informed.
He added that in the first phase, workers in the autumn installed an airtight system and installed an electrical installation in the area.
About 360,000 crowns.
Blansko City Library has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago's resistance has driven away the coronavirus.
Crawford's back in the game.
Not every one of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL who remain silent about the health status of the players as a grave and publish nothing at all.
As one of the few left the Crawford line.
A five-year-old cousin from Montreal was only present for the first training, and since then, he has been missing.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positively on Covid-19 and that is why I have spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," he told me the reason for his absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford's ready to throw himself back into full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do anything to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalie won with Chicago two Stanley Cups, a firm part of the goalpost is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks wait first for the preparatory duel with St. Louis, then face Edmonton in the vicinity.
Thousands protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption, and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dealt with the coronary crisis.
The event took place, inter alia, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding the resignation of Netanyahua for the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as for the government's decision on another wave of the Coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," according to AP, one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's generally known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his dress," stood on another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel’s first prime minister in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
All charges are denied and marked as a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process may take up to three years, calling over 300 witnesses.
In Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, the SARS-COV-2 Coronavirus confirmed nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government put in place quarantine measures to help reduce the daily growth of the infected.
However, after the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, in particular, the number of infected people has begun to rise significantly again in late June.
Netanyahu critics argue that the government has not sufficiently assisted traders affected by quarantine measures.
It also bothers the protestors that the government, in the context of the fight against coronavir, issues points of opposition.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and died.
Body must have been cut off by firefighters from the wreckage.
A tragic accident occurred around 23 p.m. at Neveklov's narrow district leading from the Slap Dam.
The driver apparently flew in at a great speed down into the woods and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
Body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being checked by the police.
They ordered a court autopsy to explain, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and cuddling one collection after the other.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
He's cancelling the discounts and he doesn't want to rub one collection after the other.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the largest environmental polluters is not a novelty.
In incinerators and landfills, billions of pieces of clothing end up a year.
The view of the slow facade, often despised access to clothing, but in recent years it has changed relatively quickly.
About half of the goods were sold by Pietro Filipi at the full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to the discounts, is simply not going to buy.
The company does not want to rub one collection after another and at the end of each season the products are cheaper at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner of Michal Micah, the times of new and old collections and blind follow-up quickly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount traders count already when buying goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it's actually kind of a scam," says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Micah.
In addition, with its approach, the company wants to support local business.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We stress that much of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and seasonal.
Globally, the segment of the premium brands of any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," says Micah.
The giant graffiti represent the RAF pilot Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The design of the city's management was appreciated," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the wars because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where they held him for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp through the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then took pilot training in Africa's South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the velvet revolution, he visited both the Czech Republic and the native Teplice several times, which gave him an honorable citizenship.
The 16-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the street graphic arts industry have known under the name Camo, has been working with sprays in thermal streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces that Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) then gave him for these purposes.
Hanna's storm has reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight SELČ at night for today) on the southwestern coast of the American state of Texas.
The Texas island of Padre Island, about 25 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, was hit, and as it moved over the mainland, it weakened in a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, coastal populations are in great danger.
It brought with it strong wind and intense precipitation; along with local floods, according to the AP agency, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 districts in the southwest of Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastline between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay Bay Bay Bay, but he was supposed to live to invade an area nearly 500 kilometres long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous storms and a single tornado pose a threat," the American National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned.
This morning the local time (SELČ afternoon) of the storm was moving in the area of the American-Mexico border and was accompanied by a wind of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was driven by a wind of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but in the course of the course of the mainland, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which shut Hannah out of the hurricane category again.
The local authorities have called on the storms to stay at home and not to forget the hygienic measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to those American states that the disease pandemic covid-19 reduces the most.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, the possible evacuation is also a major challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for the evacuated who had a positive test for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
The local authorities have invited all evacuated to take clothes and disinfectants with them to the shelter if possible.
"We still don't have it far behind us.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP by Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions suggest that in some places within a few hours there could be up to 300 millimeters of precipitation, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which, together with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal habitats.
Zeman will lend general rank to Colonel Lipk
President Milos Zeman will lend general rank to Colonel Paul Lipk on Wednesday.
It's coming out of the Department of Defense's expected events.
The reason for the loan of the rank of Brigadier General is the August entry of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the Allied Multinational Division of the Northeast of Poland.
Lipka is still acting as the deputy commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
A promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Rzehka as deputy commander of the multinational division in the north-east of the Polish Elblag, which is in charge of the Allied Presence Units in the territory of Poland and Pobalt.
He became Director of the National Cyber and Information Security Office (NUKIB) in March.
The government has proposed to the president to lend Lipk the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Act on Occupational Soldiers, a higher rank may be lent to a soldier for the duration of the elected function or for the duration of the service task which requires the borrowing of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the Allied Division shall be the responsibility of the General rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been lent shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he does not have the right to adjust the salary that would correspond to the rank.
The borrowing of a rank shall be without prejudice to the reason for which it has been granted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
He has a significant role in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on a proposal for promotion.
The mid-level promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. in Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir aviation standards
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help limit the spread of new coronavir.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the departure or wearing of clothes in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported it.
"I am glad that my colleagues adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and had yet to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended distance of safety checks and departures at the airport.
There must also be sufficient fresh air in the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
At arctic spikes, the temperature record fell, measured almost 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen, a 41-year-old record fell," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Fahrenheit [21.7 ° C.], bringing about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit [0.4 ° C] in 1979, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest town in Spitzberky, some 1,300 km from the north Pole.
The spikes are heating faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the danger posed by the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, the Norwegian Climate Research Centre reported last year.
The average temperature in Spitzberks, according to him, has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By the year 2100 it can rise even ten degrees if the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere does not decrease.
Temperature growth can be caused by the melting of permanently frozen soil in Spicberky, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can also cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Brittany, who will return from Spain, awaits a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of disease spreading.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a certain country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British fear, among other things, that they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter, from Sittingbourne, booked a ten - day vacation on Lanzarote, flew away on Tuesday.
They've been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go to the whole family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a driver, and I don't think my employer is going to join me on a two-week vacation in quarantine," said Metro Hunter.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
During the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always arrived in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas have already tightened the coronavir measures, such as Catalonia, trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of diseases in Catalánsk, Aragonia, Basque Country and the region of Madrid.
The model of the purchase of electricity from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss Monday the model of buying electricity from the planned new block of Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The proposal for a law is based on the fact that, if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be different.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and ČEZ energy company have already stated that it is more likely that people will be spared thanks to electricity construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook on electricity prices on markets is always uncertain, as has been shown several times in the past.
The intention had already been criticized by environmental organisations.
"The ransom price may be below the market price of both the electricity and the electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact is distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the material.
Havlíček stated in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would rise and the people on the Dukovan building would earn.
Otherwise, tens of crowns per family will have an impact, which is far less than people pay in annual invoices for electricity to support the so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatthour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, to be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, at which traders now make the most available, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"In contrast to the purchase price and market prices of 10 euros, the average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - may correspond to four households, standardly equipped with electric appliances, including electric hot boards and pipes, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year," the MPO government said.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronary pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecasting of market prices to be a speculative issue," the ČTK said previously the Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law is based on the fact that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, in particular by the designated legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum period of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including a repeated one, but not longer than the end of low-carbon production.
A low-carbon production design defines as a nuclear reactor power plant connected to an installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček earlier stated that the new dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodins of electricity annually, corresponding to a dozen expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the model of financing of the new Dukovan bloc on Monday.
The facility should be financed without interest in the construction, with a two-percent interest on the operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and the possibility that Dukovany will build Russian or Chinese companies also bothers it.
The state should be involved in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also pay any additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš said in May ČTK that the expected sum for building a block at current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion crowns).
The treaties between the State and the CEZ on the construction of the new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Local Development Downloads Media Support Material for Two Billion
The material under which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and on billboards for vacation advertising in the Czech Republic, the office withdrew from the review procedure.
Minister Klára Dotálová (for ANO) of the SeznamZavly.cz server said that the material is still being worked on.
The eKlep document (electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the Zdoprevy.cz server.
The Ministry of Planning has justified the decline in tourism due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, income and media declined.
The proposal sparked criticism by the opposition and representatives of the tourism movement.
According to the proposal, which is now to be seen on the web of hlidacstat.cz, the MMR planned to give money through the state agency to support the CzechTourism tourism movement on television, radio, print, internet, billboards or station areas.
Most of the money, 700 million crowns, would get television.
Most people would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly journals would receive 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of them private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or on the subway.
The tourism promotion campaign in the Czech Republic was due to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," said Dotálová without further details of the Report List server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Marketa Pekarová Adama, the media would profit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this display of contempt will be given in the autumn in election morning between the eyes," she tweeted.
She rejects the fact that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crises.
"It may even be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," Diary N said Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it could be less and more.
It is a working material," she added.
The Rescue Tourism initiative does not provide a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a unnecessary advertising campaign," President Tomáš Barčík said on Sunday.
If these two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should direct companies, not the media, the initiative is in the open letter to the government.
A boil of life, a cock of beer and death like a stem of grass
The third album with the title and death is the grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left on 24 May.
In Frič's discography is the fifth item and, like previous titles, there is a major emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is itself an excellent interpreter.
Fritz, the year 1949, was naturally influenced by the American Beat Generation, but he was shepherding this inspiration through his own, specially given experiences and also very internal expressions of faith.
Of course, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, completely tolerant, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God.
In this context, I think of Boguslav Reynek (in contrast to Jana Gardeníček, for example), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always very sensitively accompanied him, whether it was the violinist Josef Klíč, or Honza Barton and Vítezslav Holata.
I will help - like - with the words of the Istrian poet Peter Hrushka about Fritz's long poems.
"Salas of them was proud and unending bitterness," writes Krusek, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into dull consumer vanity and greed, is increasingly away from what its soul was created from - from the secrets of faith, humility and human proximity.
It was the distress of someone who knows that the values he was created for are of little interest to him, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of concern can they be denied.
Those poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything that is expensive, but it doesn't matter how he loses it.
If he sells himself to a general decline, he sceptically resigns, fearfully silences himself, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud period on what he believes and what he loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamáček said
The former Prime Minister and ČSSD President Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The President of the Party and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamster said it on the Prime Party TV show today.
On Friday, Paroubek informed the server ListNews.cz that he should be Hamáček's advisor.
"Sometimes we'll write a text, he'll send me some material and I'll read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that it was not official and paid cooperation, however.
According to ČSSD, it does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"That sometimes I read his opinion, so many people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS Member Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members are still "undercoverly listening to the opinions of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay, because it's an experienced politician and a former president of the party, which is also the case with Paroubka.
The fact that the media is having an affair marked this year's cucumber season.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that Peter Benda, the former president of the local cell, was the fourth candidate of the party in the oral region, who was associated with Paroubek and acted as vice-president of his party LEV 21.
Hamalek said today that the candidate's composition would not comment until it was ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile head, he's a kick in the ass, poor Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole that has the ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Junior Duplantise, beat him last year to have an NCAA association.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won and I was second, then we threw it away.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nielsen, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since fired steeply upwards and is currently in the highest tician spheres alone.
In his 20 ’ s, he became a world recorder, this year in Toruni on February 8th, he overcame a six - foot [6.17 m] patch, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six metres back when he graduated from high school," remembers his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from boy to man, all his potential and talent would multiply.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record," she believes.
Although Nielsen's record of success is thinner than the one Duplantis proud of, the American sets similar goals.
In February, he improved his internal personal record at 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Panamanian games in Lima, and in 2017 he fought for the US World Championship, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone then is for him to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It is definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," she realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, no doubt you can do the same at events such as Olympics, World Championships or Panamanian Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nielsen and the rest of the poles time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into just a fight for silver?
"Everyone's trying to reach him, but I don't think it's going to be possible soon," Nielsen thinks.
"That boy's been jumping for 16 years, and in practice, he's got a head start on everyone else."
And by the time Tokyo starts 2021, he's gonna want to raise it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands on a disability pension of an impossible son.
She's got a trial coming up.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman is threatened with up to eight years in prison.
Because of his poor health, the court dismissed the sick man’s rightfulness, and his mother was appointed a guardian who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to this January, a woman used part of her son's disability pension for her needs and prepared him for 440,000 crowns," police spokesman Dana Ladman said, saying that the accused woman was burdened with having a special duty as guardian to protect the interests of the victim.
The woman, according to the court's order, gave her son an account, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs of her son's stay in a health facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electric appliances and household," the prosecution said.
That she couldn't use her son's money for her own sake, the woman confessed.
However, she objected by helping with their family expenses.
"We had trouble with our incomes to tighten the course of the household.
We've never bought anything superstandard.
It was always about things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to pay her son back.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, according to scientists after the discovery of instruments
The findings of the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments of limestone, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and high-end objects that could serve as pinnacles or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said the archaeologist Cyprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published on this topic in Nature magazine.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite caves, located at high altitudes, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, generally accepted theory has been that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossed the mainland bridge from the area of Russia today to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clown culture has subsequently spread in much of North America.
But this model has been torn in the last decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In a second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different locations throughout North America have been reported to demonstrate the human presence on the continent since 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland before it was supposed to be.
Some of them could have made it to America by boat.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
So far, the interest in tickets is filling in an optimistic scenario, according to the seller.
Prices are decreasing gradually as well.
Flight sales in the Czech Republic grow every week.
Despite last summer’s interest is still roughly half, but demand increases by up to 20 percent every week.
After the crisis, according to the sellers, it fills the most optimistic scenarios.
Flight prices are also gradually falling.
Among the most sought-after destinations are, according to sellers in particular, the South European States.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece are running.
At the portal Letuška.cz the most flights are sold to the Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, the most sought after UK, which, however, was one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average price of flights is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz, around 6250 crowns were around the middle of the month, with 3,000 crowns less each year.
This is mainly due to an increase in the demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, prices have dropped to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, by about a fifth in the past few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying flights with much less speed than before, because they are afraid of further developments in the coronavir situation.
According to earlier information Kiwi.com, the period of purchase of the flight prior to departure decreased by about 10 days annually.
"This confirms our future trend, when people will order tickets with much less speed, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice President for products Kiwi.com Michal Šindelár.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
At the Prague airport, there are currently regular routes to more than 60 destinations.
Last summer's season is about half the destination.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the arrow fight live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand finale.
It will introduce experienced nine-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and surprise tournament, six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson in the first round shut down Justin Pip, then ran into his neighbor in a ladder.
Even James Wade, however, coped with it, and in the quarterfinals, he had a good argument with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world’s number one.
"Flying Scott" was almost in the semifinal when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the tomb from the shovel, in extension dominated and after the result 18:16 he fought the place in the finals of the tournament, which he had already ruled in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and just maybe knowing that it has nothing to lose helped him play on a totally fantastic wave.
The 60 - year - old arrowman first surprisingly knocked out Nathan Aspinall's world six, pushed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and in the quarterfinals, Adrian Lewis was defeated.
A big check was the semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the introduction, but calmly playing Belgian then gained a remarkable series of lead, which then more or less without problems held to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high score, which he encountered from time to time uncertainty in the doubles.
Coronavir cases have arrived at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15 212 people have been infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, there are 5,254 people who are ill.
This comes from data on the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four hundred times each other.
The maximum was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday there were positive 235 tested, the day before 246 and Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
Out of covid-19, 9,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of them still infected.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
In the hospital, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in the conversion to 100,000 inhabitants is still reported by Karvinska, almost 59.
Next comes Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Městecko with 36 infected to 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of coronavir have been in place since Saturday.
People have to wear dresses at internal mass events of over 100 people, it is cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals within buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been demonstrably infected with the new coronavir has already exceeded 16 million.
The American University of Johns Hopkins reported this, which is monitoring the development of the pandemic globally.
The balance of the victims who died with covid-19 disease is approaching 645 thousand according to this source.
The latest million infected came to statistics in just three days; the 15 million border fell on July 22.
In recent days, the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million people infected, Brazil, 2.4 million, and India, with nearly 1.4 million people being infected by the authorities, had the largest share of rapid increase in the number of cases.
The infected are now coming at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday more than 284,000 new cases have arrived worldwide, the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the population states, such as the US, Brazil, or India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has grown in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, or Israel.
The plague has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, and the first case has been officially reported by the KLDR today.
Domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health risks not only poor air quality in outdoor areas but also at home.
Carol Abraham, an Israeli expert on human health, had already quoted the journal The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on household damage right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research by the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the external air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that because of poor air quality in its homes, 3.8 million people die prematurely each year.
"Because of an epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many and still forced them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of the air in their homes," said Abraham.
In Israel, the quality of "domestic air" is almost unknown.
Dangerous things that a person normally comes into contact with — coatings, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"Nuclear gas also produces clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," said Abraham.
According to her, children, elderly household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances may damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all pests but they come from objects inside households, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.

Karel Gott didn't like Vaclav Havel?!
Dominique's daughter discovered it.
"Daddy didn't have him for many years," she said to Aha! the eldest daughter of Gott Dominika, with the fact that the Master couldn't come to Hava's name and whenever a speech came to him, Carla always said it was angry.
It's hard to tell what they did, but according to Dominic, the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had made it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he resisted somehow, he had an end to his career," Gott says.
But he adds that in the end, the Czech greats found their way.
"I know the word Havel couldn't hear in his 60s at all.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter to his birthday and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Finally, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70s at the Ambassador Hotel in Václav Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because then Dad regularly invited Mr Havel home to Bertramka," added the blonde whose father died last October.
It was also said that Václav Havel had never been awarded a state honor.
After all, he met him in 2009, even though it was already with the hands of his successor in the role of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honour awaits in memory, the current President Milos Zeman (75) is to give him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
