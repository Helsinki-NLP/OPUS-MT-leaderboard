On Tuesday Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, won the presidential election of the Republican Party in Florida with 46%.
Second place with 32% was Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States.
Florida is the state in which the winner takes everything, and all 50 delegates were therefore granted the Romney vote, thus leading the race for the nomination of the Republican Party.
According to the protest organizers, about 100,000 people took to the streets in German cities such as Berlin, Colonia, Hamburg, and Hanover.
According to police estimates, the number of protesters was 6,500.
Protests also crossed the streets of Paris, Sofia (Bulgaria), Vilnius (Lithuania), Valtty (Malta), Tallina (Estonia) and Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotnia).
More than 200 people protested outside the offices of some of the leading copyright holders in London.
Last month there were major protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which is why the Polish government still did not ratify the agreement.
Both Latvia and Slovakia postponed the accession procedure to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and RSPCA (Kingdom Society for the Prevention of Animal Cruelty) repeat the call for mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in all slaughterhouses in Australia.
David O'Shannessy, Chief Inspector of RSPCA (An anti-violence organization against animals), told ABC that surveillance and inspection of the slaughterhouse in Australia should be standard procedures.
"Installing monitoring in a strong way would show animal workers that their welfare is the highest priority."
The International Earthquake Map of the U.S. Scientific and Research Agency did not report any earthquakes in Iceland last week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office reported that there have been no earthquakes in the Hekla region in the last 48 hours.
Significant seismic activity resulting in changes in the phase was recorded on 10 March on the north-east side of the highest volcano calendar.
Dark clouds have been observed at the foot of the mountain, which do not result from any volcanic activity.
The clouds may have made it difficult to tell if there was actually an eruption.
The moon transported 120 to 160 cubic metres of fuel when there was an accident and strong winds combined with waves pushed it to the falcon.
The helicopters saved twelve crew members; the only damage they had was a broken nose.
The stommetric ship was headed for a standard fertilizer load, and in the beginning, officials were concerned that there might be a leak.
The proposed amendment passed through both chambers in 2011.
During this legislative session a change was introduced – the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then adopted on Monday in a similar form by the Senate.
The ineffectiveness of the second entry, which proposes a ban on single-sex unions, may pave the way for the legalisation of partnerships in the future.
Subsequently, resolution HJR-3 will be reconsidered by another elected legislative body in 2015 or 2016 as part of the follow-up procedure.
In addition to directing Voutier's achievements, there was a hunger strike in 1973 against what he described as political censorship.

He was also accused of violating copyright before, but he was not charged.
An ex - student said that “he spoke slang in class, taught dating skills and was like a fellow student. ”
China has developed a market economy over the past 30 years, although the official communist regime has not undergone a transformation.
The first economic reforms were implemented under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, China first exported more cars than Germany, racing the United States as the largest market in the industry.
In two decades, China’s GDP may exceed the United States’ GDP.
Danielle's tropical cyclone, the fourth known cyclone from the hurricane season in the Atlantic in 2010, formed in the eastern Atlantic.
The storm is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, reaching the maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that by Wednesday Danielle will regain strength and become a hurricane.
Since the storm is far from the ground, it is difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, who came into the world in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, became famous thanks to the game at the Partizan Belgrade Club.
He was with them from 1945 to 1958.
When he was on the team, he won 403 goals in 468 meetings.
No one's ever played so many games or shot so many goals for a club like Bobek.
In 1995, he was elected the best player in Partizan's history.
Celebrations began with a special presentation by the world - renowned Cirque du Soleil group.
The following were the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Yanchars and Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
The next item was the whirling dervishes.

Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero added that "the financial system is part of the economy, and it is a key element.
The financial crisis has been a year and the last two months have been the most difficult period, but I believe that the financial markets will start to rise from the gap in the near future."
Last week, the Naked News programme issued a statement of its intention to radically extend its range of news in several languages by three new audits.
The World Organisation, which currently publishes reports in English and Japanese, is already preparing programmes in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the Internet and mobile devices.
Fortunately, I didn't get hurt, but I won't forget that macabre scene when people tried to break out the windows to get out.
People were banging chairs in the windows, but the windows were made of non-cracking glass.
"One of the windows finally broke, so people started coming out the window," said Francis Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat, using the energy generated by the fusion (or melting) of hydrogen atoms to form heavier particles.
Scientists are trying to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, the solution to this problem is difficult and it will take many years before a useful thermonuclear reactor can be constructed.
The steel pin drifts on the surface of the water due to tension on the surface.
The surface voltage occurs because the water particles on its surface attract stronger than the water and air particles over them.
Items such as the needle are able to float onto the water table by means of the invisible coating that the particles form on the surface of the water.
The beach of modern ice skating has two edges separated by a rope. Two edges increase the grip on the ice, even when they are set at an angle.
The back of the blade is slightly curved, so when the blade is tilted on one side, the back is also curved with ice.
This makes the skater turn. When the skaters turn to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the skaters turn to the left, the skater turns to the left.
In order to return to an earlier level of energy, they must remove additional energy from light.
They're doing it through a tiny particle of light called a photon.
This process is referred to by scientists as "stimulated radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes photon emissions of light, and light is a form of radiation.
The next image shows atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than in this picture.
The photons are even smaller than the particles that form atoms!
Hundreds of hours of work cause the bulb in the bulb to finally light up and the bulb stops to glow.
Then it is necessary to replace the bulb. Caution should be exercised when switching the bulb.
First, turn off the light or turn off the cable.
This is because the current affecting the cap in which the metal part of the bulb is located can seriously be struck when touching the inside of the lamp or the metal base of the lamp when it is partially in the envelope.
The primary organ in the circulation system is the heart, pumping blood.
The blood is drawn from the heart by “wires”, which are called arteries, and is produced by “wires” called veins. The definition of the hairy vessel refers to the smallest such “wires”.
Triceratops teeth could rot not only leaves, but also extremely hard branches and roots.
According to some scholars, triceratops fed on sagos, or crayon plants.
This plant resembles a small palm tree with a crown created by sharp, sticking leaves.
A strong mouth could be useful for triceratops when he wanted to rip off the leaves before he went to eat the stump.
Other scientists say that these plants are highly poisonous, so it is not possible for dinosaurs to eat them, although today sloths and other animals, such as parrots (dinozaur offspring) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would the force of gravity on the moon of Io work on me?
The person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the moon Io. The force of gravity is, of course, much smaller.
The sun has no shell like the Earth on which you can stand. The sun is entirely made of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas is diluted as it moves away from the sun.
The outer rim that we see when we look at the sun is called the photoosphere, which literally means "the sphere of light".
The Venus phases, similar to those of the moon, were observed about three thousand years later (in 1610) by Galileo, who used the telescope for this purpose.
The phases result from light reaching only one side of Venus (or the moon), the one that is turned towards the Sun. Copernicus' theory, according to which planets orbit around the Sun, had its confirmation in the Venus phases.
Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed the Venus transit several years later, and exactly in 1639.
After Danelawa’s reflection, England experienced a long period of peace.
In 991, however, Ethelred had to face the Viking fleet, with which only the Guthrum fleet could be equal hundreds of years ago.
Olaf Trygvasson, Norway, was the leader of the fleet, whose ambition was to rid Denmark of its domination of its country.
At first, Ethelred did not succeed in the field of battle, but he was able to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway and tried to regain his kingdom, though with various consequences.
The Hangul is the only specially invented alphabet that is in everyday use. It was invented in 1444 for the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Seyong sat on the throne as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and to this day he enjoys great recognition.
In the beginning, he will define the alphabet hangul called Hunmin Jeongeum, which is “the right sound to teach people”.
Many theories were formulated about how Sanskrit was born, and one of them speaks of the migration of Aryans who brought their language from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is considered to be an Eastern equivalent of European Latin.
The first known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the preparation of the upanishad Sanskrit simply lost its meaning because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is an extremely complex and rich language, from which many modern languages are derived in India, just as Latin is a source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After the victory of the French campaign, the Germans set off with preparations for the invasion of Great Britain.
The Germans called the attack "Operation of the Lion of the Sea". Most of the heavy weapons and resources of the British army were lost when the Dunkierka left, so the army was quite weak.
Nevertheless, the British Navy continued to outrank the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and was able to defeat any enemy fleet that would affect the Channel of La Manche.
Few British Navy ships were on potential invasion routes because the admirals were afraid of being drowned by an air raid on the Germans.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was, above all, the "younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and navy were weaker, even though they had built four new ships just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries. To take over, they needed a start-up platform for the military to cross the Mediterranean and to attack Africa.
To do this, they had to eliminate British bases and ships from the game in Egypt. Moreover, Italian warships had no other tasks.
And now it's time for Japan, Japan was an island country, just like Great Britain.
Underwater boats are vessels designed for longer journeys under the surface of the water.
The submarines were used during World War I and II and were then very slow and had limited range of shots.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but with the development and greater accuracy of the radar submarines were forced to descend underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines were called U-bots. Germany was perfectly able to navigate and operate submarines.
The Germans successfully used submarines and, therefore, after the war, lack of confidence did not want them to have too many.
Yes! King Tutenchamon, sometimes called "King Tut" or "King of the boy", is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times he was not considered important, he was not included in most of the letters of ancient kings.
However, when his tomb was discovered in 1922, it became a celebrity, although many ancient tombs were the victims of robberies, the tomb was actually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tuttenchamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious and rare stones.
The invention of the Assyrians ’ spring wheels made the Assyrians lighter, faster, and more effective in the pursuit of warriors and other chariots.
Shots from their murderous executions could have broken the armor of enemy soldiers, more or less in 1000 B.C.E., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
Cavalry is a military formation made up of armed horse riders. The saddle was not invented until then, so Assyrian cavalrymen sat on their horses in armor.
Many are famous Greek politicians, scholars and artists. The most famous figure in this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who created two epic masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristofanes are still popular playwrights whose art is seen among the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is Pythagoras, a mathematician, known primarily for his famous claim about the relationship of sides in rectangular triangles.
There are different calculations about the number of people using Hindi. It is estimated that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used languages of the world.
The inclusion or exclusion of closely related dialects affects the determination of the total number of native users of the language concerned.
According to estimates, this language is used from 340 million to 500 million people, and up to 800 million are able to understand it.
In Hindi and Urdu languages, vocabulary is similar, but a different letter; in everyday communication, users of both languages are usually able to understand each other.
In the 15th century, northern Estonia was very culturally influenced by Germany.
Part of the German monks wanted to draw closer to the God of the local population, so they invented a literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet, but one sign was added: ‘Õ/õ’.
As time went on, many words borrowed from Germany came together, and that was the beginning of enlightenment.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne after graduation went straight to the army.
Charles, however, went to the University of Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then history, gaining 2:2 (lower grade second degree).
As the first member of the British royal family, Charles received a degree in science.
The European part of Turkey (covering Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey exceeds 1,600 kilometres (1000 miles) of length and 800 kilometres (500 miles) of width, has roughly rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface, including lakes, extends to 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) is located in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey's surface makes it the 37th-largest country of the world, about the size of the metropolitan France and Great Britain combined.
Turkey has access to the sea on three sides: from the west to the Aegean Sea, from the north to the Black Sea and from the south to the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but independence gained in 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became the property of Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 1930s.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, it has not avoided German occupation during the first and second world wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg joined an organisation known today as the European Union as a Member State and a founding Member State.
Drukyal Dzong is the ruins of the fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built a fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
After the fire of 1951, only some of the relics of Drogyal Dzonga remained, e.g. the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress has been preserved and protected and is still one of the most impressive attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was squeezed between two powerful neighbors: Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais attacked Cambodia several times, and in 1772 they destroyed the city of Phnom Penh.
By the end of the 18th century, the Vietnamese had also invaded Cambodia.
18% of the Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those with employment work in the grey zone.
Two out of three Venezuelans who work in the service sector, almost every fourth in industry, and every fifth in agriculture.
Oil plays an important role in the Venezuelan economy, which exports more of this raw material than it imports, although only one percent of the population works in this sector.
Shortly after the nation gained independence, the island was transformed into a tropical Garden City by experts from botanical gardens in Singapore.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, obtained the status of a national flower.
Each year in October, nearly 1.5 million plant - eaters move in pursuit of the rain from the northern hills toward the southern plains, crossing the Mara River along the way.
And then north again, through the west, again through the river Mara, after the April rains.
The Serengeti region consists of the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Protective Area, the Tanzanian Wildlife Reserve and the Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills and tools known during interactive classes (create scenarios, edit movies and sound recordings, tell stories, etc.).
In order to design interactively, it is necessary to re-evaluate the assumptions on media production and learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive project, the elements must be connected, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem with the variable-focal lens is that the complexity and number of elements needed to obtain a certain range of focal distances are much greater than in the fixed-point lens.
This is becoming a growing problem because lens manufacturers are achieving increasingly higher standards in their production.
This allows variable-focal lenses to take photos with a quality comparable to that obtained by fixed-focal lenses.
Another negative for variable-focal lenses is the fact that the maximum width of the lens (speed) is usually lower.
Therefore, cheaper variable-focal lenses make it difficult to light if the flash lamp is not used.
One of the most common problems when converting a film to a DVD format is adjusting the image size.
The satisfaction of the general customer is a key criterion in the production of most TVs.
That's why everything that's shown on the TV screen has been cut off on the bottom, on the top and on the sides.
This is to ensure that the entire screen is covered by the image. This function is named overscan.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, its frame is likely to be cut off, and if the inscriptions in the video are too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
The tournaments, banquets and knights of the Round Table have long been elements of imagination inspired by the traditional motif of the medieval castle.
Even standing among the thousands of years of ruins, you can easily summon the sounds and smells of long - gone battles and practically hear the thuds of hooves on the prowl, as well as the feeling of loch-bearing fear.
But is this reality the builder of our imagination? Why did they even start building locks? How were they designed and built?
The standard for this period is Kirby Muxloe Castle, a more fortified house than a real castle.
Large glass windows and shaded walls wouldn't be able to resist a strong attack for too long.
In the 1980 ’ s, when Lord Hastings began his construction, the country was relatively calm and only needed protection from small groups of traveling robbers.
The balance of power was a system by which European nations sought to maintain national sovereignty in all countries in Europe.
In line with this concept, all European nations have had to push one nation to power, and governments have often changed allies to maintain an international balance.
The first armed conflict, whose stake was the balance of power, is the war for Spanish success.
This was a significant change, since European powers would no longer have the pretext to wage religious wars, so a 30 - year - old war would be the last war to be called a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C.E. as a result of the burning of Herodus.
The story says that he sought fame at all costs, and the outraged Ephesians announced that the name of Herostrates should be removed from human memory.
Greek historian Strabon then wrote down the name as we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered to cover the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible by correctly hitting all the notes – and try not to make unnecessary movements of your fingers.
This way you can avoid fatigue. Remember that you do not need to push the keys harder to make the sound louder, as is the case with the piano.
To gain more volume, when playing the accordion, you must move with more pressure or more speed.
Mysticism consists in the pursuit of unification or identification with the ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God, or the attainment of their full consciousness.
A believer seeks direct experience, intuition or insight into the depths of divine reality / deity or deities.
They pursue a certain lifestyle or engage in practices that are designed to care for such experiences.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religious belief and worship by exerting pressure on personal, direct experience of an exceptional state of consciousness, especially this mild, deep, mild and even exotic.
Sikhism is a religion that was born on the Indian subcontinent in the Penjab region in the 15th century due to a breakdown within the Indian tradition.
The Sikhs do not identify their religion with Hinduism, although they admit that it has Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means “drug guru”. Guru is the foundation of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it is so important that it is the essence of Sikh's beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), and its successors include another nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, there was a confrontation between the promises of Khrushchev and the inhabitants of Poland, when labour demonstrations against food shortages and wage cuts turned into a protest aimed at communism as such.
Although finally Khrushchev sent the tanks to restore order, he went to economic concessions and agreed that the popular Władysław Gomolka would take the position of prime minister.
The civilization of the Indus Valley existed in the Bronze Age in the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent, including most of today's Pakistan, as well as some of the regions in North-West India and North-East Afghanistan.
Civilisation flourished in the basins of the Indus River, where its name came from.
Although they are scientists who assume that since this civilization existed in the river Saraswati today, it can be equally well called the Indus-Saraswati Civilisation, while other researchers use the name “Harapa Civilisation”, referring to Harappa, the first settlement discovered in the 20th century.
The militaristic character of the Roman Empire contributed to progress in medicine.
The first medical recruitment was initiated by Emperor Augustus and resulted in the first Roman medical corps serving wounded soldiers in battle.
The surgeons knew a variety of tranquilizers, including morphine obtained on the basis of poppy extracts and scopolamine from black pipe seeds.
They gained amputation skills to protect patients from gangrene, as well as in the use of pressure belts and arterial clamps to inhibit blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved much in medicine and has influenced the knowledge we have today.
Pureland’s origami is that only one bend is allowed once, not to make folding, e.g. bending and bending, and all foldings must have a flat position.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970 ’ s to help people who have no experience in origami or whose mobility is limited.
The awareness of race and racial stereotypes is growing quite early in children, and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children identified with a racial minority who according to stereotypes do not do well at school are not usually well when they learn about this stereotype.
MySpace is currently the third most popular site in the United States, covering 54 million profiles.
These websites attract a lot of attention, especially in the education environment.
These sites have their positive aspects, including the ability to easily configure a class site containing blogs, videos, photos and other elements.
You can access this page by providing only one web address, which facilitates remembering and entering students who may have problems with writing and typing on the keyboard.
This can be adjusted to facilitate reading, as well as with any or a small amount of color.
The attention syndrome “is a neurological accident, defined in a classic way by a triad of symptoms: impulse, deconcentration and over-inspiration or excessive energy”.
It is not a disability, it is a learning disorder that “touches between 3 and 5 percent of children, maybe 2 million American children”.
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on science, but for this they can focus on what gives them pleasure, such as playing games or watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without any punctuation.
These children have a tendency to get into trouble because they “take risks, fight and challenge authority ” to stimulate the brain because they cannot get it by normal means.
ADD affects relationships with peers who may have problems understanding why someone behaves in this way, why they write this, and why their maturity is different.
Knowledge and learning skills have changed as described above, and the pace of learning has changed.
The attitude towards obtaining information was different. The press was no longer in individual memory, but more important was the ability to summon text.
In principle, the Renaissance has significantly changed its approach to science and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primary hominids, they no longer use their hands to move, carry or move between trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzees have a similar size and length, indicating that the hand is used to carry the weight of the body while walking on the curved fingers of the hand.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more upright sticks.
The fossils of the hands two to three million years ago show how hand specialization has changed from movement to manipulation.
According to some, frequent awakening of conscious dreams can lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams prolong the time between REM stages.
If less sleep falls into the night, the problem becomes the low frequency of the condition in which you actually sleep and your body regenerates.
It's as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes after watching TV.
The frequency at which the brain tries to dream consciously during the night has an impact.
Since the beginning of the Italian case in North Africa, it has not been very good. In the week since the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, 11 British Hussaria took over Fort Capuzo in Libya.
General Lastucci, chief of engineering of the tenth Italian army, was captured by the British in an ambush east of Badria.
On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, governor-general of Libya and the apparent successor of Mussolini, was killed by a fratricidal fire while landing in Tobruk.
Modern sermierka is played at many levels, from students studying at universities to professional professions and Olympics.
Most often, this sport takes the form of a match between two swordsmen.
Golf is a game in which participants use clubs to point balls at holes.
In the standard round there are eighteen holes, the players usually start from the first hole in the field and end up on the eighteenth.
He who has the smallest number of bat strokes or strokes in his account wins.
The game is played on grass, which is shorter around the bottom and called green.
Recreational tourism is perhaps the most common type of tourism, by most people associated with travel.
That's when people go to places that are completely different from what surrounds them every day to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and biking areas are usually the most popular places used by recreational tourists.
Cultural tourism means a type of tourism that involves learning about the history and culture of the places visited.
Tourists can visit different country-specific sites or they can focus only on one area.
The colonists, looking at this activity, also called for meals.
The forequarters were composed of the 1st and 3rd regiments of New Hampshire, which numbered 200, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both became generals).
Stark's subcommands set up along the north end of the position occupied by the Colonists.
When the tide opened a free passage along the Mystic River from the northeast side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fortification with a short stone wall from the north end along the coast on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark scored a stake about 100 feet (30 m) from the fortification and ordered not to shoot until the crossers crossed that line.
The American plan was to launch coordinated attacks on three different sides.
General John Cadwalder will start a diversion against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any support.
General James Ewing was to cross the river at Trenton Ferry along with the 700-person unit of the common movement, take the bridge over Assunpink Creek and hit the escape of enemy troops.
The attack was headed by 2400 armed forces, who were to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and split up, forming two troops, one under Greene's command, the other under Sullivan's command, to launch an attack before dawn.
When the distance changes from one quarter to half a mile, speed loses meaning, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a half - mile - long top runner that can break for two minutes must have a high speed, but endurance should be taken care of at all costs.
Some winter passes, combined with training of upper body parts on the gym, are the best preparations for the running season.
Proper nutrition does not guarantee excellent results, but can significantly affect the general form of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective irrigation habits and understanding various aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sport.
Distance running is relatively low-cost sport, but there are many myths about a few necessary items of equipment.
Products may be purchased as required, but most of them will have a negligible or zero impact on productivity.
Sportsmen may feel that they prefer the product, although it offers no real benefits.
An atom can be considered one of the fundamental elements that build all matter.
This is a very complex unit, which, according to the simplified Bohra model, consists of a central nucleus around which there are electrons, which somewhat resembles planets orbiting the Sun – see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
In terms of electric charge, protons are positive, electrons are negative, and neutrons have no load.
To see what's wrong with the victim, you have to first assess whether the scene is not a threat to you.
As you approach the victim, keep an eye on the victim’s location, as well as the natural warning signals.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, it'll only make things worse.
The study showed that depression, fear, and pessimistic attitudes were closely related to the pain and fragility of people suffering from cross pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking were dependent on regular, weekly physical exercises, and this was not the case with depression and fear.
People involved in regular activity need more support when it comes to negative perceptions of pain in order to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal movement.
The vision, that is, the ability to see, depends on the organs of the senses of the eye, or the eyes.
The design of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity, which depends on the requirements of the body.
Different systems are characterized by different possibilities, sensitive to different wavelengths and different degrees of visual acuity, and also require different processes to interpret input data, and an adequate number of organs to function optimally.
A population called the collection of organisms of one species residing in a particular geographical area.
All individuals in the population who have a particular phenotype are called monomorphic.
When individuals are characterized by several variants of a particular feature, they are polymorphic.
Military ant colonies march and plant nests also at other stages.
In the travel phase, an army of ants marches at night and camps during the day.
The colony begins the nomadic phase when the amount of available food has decreased. During this phase the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each such nomadic ride or march lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? This word is derived from a Latin “cell” meaning “small room” and is forged by a researcher who observed the structure of the cork under the microscope.
The cell is the basic builder of all living organisms, which must have at least one cell.
In fact, so fundamental and crucial is the role of cells in the study of life that they are often called “elements of life”.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses to the body so that the blood flow is not disrupted.
These nerve impulses travel around the body at such a high speed that they help protect them from potential danger.
tornadoes hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
The tornadoes rip out trees, take the boards off buildings, and throw cars into the air, and the most violent two percent of the tornadoes last more than three hours.
In these monstrous storms, the wind reaches up to 480 km/h (133 m/s, 300 mph).
For thousands of years, people have produced and used lenses to view objects in magnification.
But the first real telescopes were built in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to zoom in and increase remote objects.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us, and the essence of cooperation is that if most benefit, acting selfishly, short-term gains will be greater.
It is to be hoped that most people will open their eyes and see that working with others is the best long-term option for them.
Many people dream of the day when they can travel to another star and discover other worlds; some wonder what is there, some believe that other planets live alien or other forms of life.
But if this ever happens, it's probably not for a long time. The stars are at great distances from each other, the neighbors often share trillions of miles.
Maybe someday your grandkids will be in a foreign world, thinking about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells, they eat things and digest them, most animals can move.
The brain is an organ that we only find in animals, and yet not in all, for example, jellyfish have no brain.
There's no place on earth where there's no animals, underground tunnels, floating in ocean waters, floating in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The source of the word “cell” is the Latin word “cella” which means a small room.
When you look at living beings under a microscope, you can see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, looked at the cork under the microscope and saw small squares.
They looked like rooms, and he was the first person to observe dead cells.
The elements and compounds can go from one state to another and not change.
The nitrogen in the form of gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is thicker, but the particles are identical.
Another example is water, consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
The molecular structure is identical to gas, liquid and solid.
Although the state of focus may change, the chemical composition remains unchanged.
Time is all around us, it affects all our actions, and at the same time it's so hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of research by scientists, philosophers and theologians.
We experience time as a sequence of events from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also used to compare the duration of events (their duration in time).
You can mark the passage of time on your own by observing the recurrences of a cyclical event, the distinctive feature of which is regular repetition.
Today, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Advanced animations can be created on the computer and are increasingly used for television and cinema.
Music is often recorded using advanced computers that process and mix sounds.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was long recognized that the first people in New Zealand were Maori, hunting for giant moa birds.
According to this theory, the Maori sailed the Great Fleet from Polynesia to New Zealand and were taken away from the Moriori people, then settled as a farming community.
However, the latest evidence shows that the Moriori tribe was a group of continental Maoris who moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture.
There was another tribe on the islands of Chatham, Maori, who had emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were a few years old, and finally the Moriori were killed.
For decades now, we have seen the value of our advantages and love, and on the other hand, we have been able to look honestly at the difficulties and failures.
When we listened to people who told stories about their personal life, family, or work, we got a lot of valuable information about the past and about personalities that had a positive or negative impact on the organization’s culture.
Although understanding its history does not imply understanding of culture, at least it helps to understand where we are in the history of the organization.
Thanks to the assessment of the success and awareness of failures, individuals as well as the whole group of participants are better acquainted with the values, mission and motivation of the organisation.
In this case, people opened up to new changes and a new direction for the local church, mentioning the entrepreneurial behavior and its successes in the past.
Such success stories have alleviated concerns about change and have inspired a positive attitude toward future change.
Methods to solve problems using different concepts or areas to find a solution called convergence thinking patterns.
This mental attitude focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the reuse of available techniques and the collection of information.
The most important element of this way of thinking: there is only one correct answer. You only consider two answers – good and bad.
This type of reasoning is linked to certain sciences or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking can think logically, remember patterns, solve problems and scientific tests.
People are the most capable species when it comes to reading people's minds.
It follows that we can effectively predict what others see and intend, what they believe, what they know and what they want.
The most important of these skills is the understanding of the intentions of others, as this can help to resolve the possible uncertainties arising from the actions carried out.
For example, when we see someone blowing up a window in a car, we'd probably assume he's trying to steal someone's car.
He should be judged differently if he lost his car keys and tried to break into his vehicle.
The MRI is based on a phenomenon called magnetic nuclear resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (working at Harvard).
In this resonance, atoms emit soft radio signals under the influence of magnetic fields and radio waves.
In 1970, doctor and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered how MRI imaging can be used for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, the patent was the world's first patent in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the scan for the entire body's magnetic resonance scan, which he called "the Immaculate".
Asynchronic communication gives time to think and respond to another person.
As a result, students can work at their own pace and control the pace of instruction.
In addition, there are fewer time limits, with the possibility of working in flexible hours (Bremer, 1998).
The possibility of using the Internet and web network gives students access to information at any time.
Students can also report questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next direct meeting.
The postmodern approach to science gives freedom from absolute truths. There is no one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one thing that should be learned from science: learning is a process that takes place in the context of the experience of a relationship between a learner and the knowledge that is presented.
This is illustrated by our current experience in television programmes, which present information, educate, teach and provide practical advice ("do it yourself").
Many of us watch TV programs that convey knowledge that we will never use and show experiences that will never become our share.
We'll never fix the car, we'll never put a fountain in the yard, we'll never go to Peru to watch the ancient ruins, and we won't rebuild the neighbor's house.
Underwater fibre connections with Europe and broadband satellite services make Greenland a good connection, and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or hosts (in the case of accommodation in a guesthouse or private accommodation) will have a Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, and in all facilities there is an online cafe with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, while the word “Eskimos” remains accepted in the United States, people outside the Arctic, especially in Canada, find it offensive.
Although you will hear that word from the natives of Greenland, foreigners should not use it.
The Greenlandic autochtons call themselves Inuits in Canada and Kalaalleq (b.k.a. Kalaallit), i.e. "Greenlanders" in Greenland.
Crime and ill will against foreigners are actually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous surroundings".
The cold may be the only real threat facing the unprepared.
Take enough warm clothes with you if you visit Greenland in colder times of the year (the farther north, the colder).
Very long summer days can cause problems with enough sleep and related health problems.
During the summer season, local mosquitoes that do not carry disease must be looked after, but they may prove to be annoying.

Traveling to Walt Disney World is the main pilgrimage of many American families.
The "standard" visit consists of a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to the Disneyland Hotel, a weekly stay without leaving Disney Centre and returning home.
The possible version is inexorable, but that's what most people mean by "we're going to Disney World".
Many tickets available for online sale on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day tickets with access to several parks per day (the so-called park-hopper).
Although this is a very common practice, Disney forbids it: tickets are insurmountable.
Camping below the coast of the Grand Canyon requires accommodation in the area (backcountry permit).
In order to protect the canyon, licences shall be made available on a limited number from the first day of the month of four months prior to the beginning of the stay.
Therefore, the travel authorisation with any starting date shall be made available on 1 January.
The location of the most popular areas, e.g. the Camp of the Bright Angel adjacent to the Upiora Ranch, is usually met with the requests received at the first time of the opening of the reservation.
The number of entry permits is limited, there are conclusions on the basis of who first, the better.
Car travel across South Africa is a wonderful way to admire the beauty of the entire region, as well as to reach places beyond normal tourist trails.
If it is well planned, a simple car can suffice, but it is strongly recommended to drive on four wheels and to many locations you can only reach such a vehicle with a large axle position.
While planning, it is important to remember that although South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
The visa requirements and costs vary depending on the country and affect the country from which the visa applicant comes.
Each country has other rules governing what rescue equipment must be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city located in the western region of Zimbabwe, near Livingstone, just across the border, Zambia, and close to the border with Botswana.
The city is located in the vicinity of waterfalls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist resort offers a lot of advantages related to a longer stay, both for adventurers and those who like to visit.
The amount of water is much larger and the waterfall looks more impressive with the arrival of the rainy season, which lasts from November to March.
I'm sure you'll get wet if you cross a bridge or a trail along waterfalls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the amount of water is so large that watching the actual waterfalls will be difficult – through all the water!
The Tomb of Tutunchamona (KV62). It is possible that the most famous tomb in the Valley is KV62, where Howard Carter discovered an almost undisturbed burial site for a young king in 1922.
Compared to most of the royal tombs of Tutenchamon, it is not particularly worth a visit because it is small and not very richly decorated.
Anyone who wants to see the damage the mummy has suffered in trying to get her out of the coffin will be disappointed, as only his head and arms are visible.
The fabulous treasures discovered in the tomb were transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Tourists who have limited time will do better by going elsewhere.
The Phnom Krom Temple, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple at the top of the hill was erected at the end of the ninth century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
It is worth climbing up for the gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap.
A visit here can be conveniently combined with a boat trip over the lake.
To enter the temple, you have to have an Angkor entrance, so if you're going to Tonle Sap, don't forget to take your passport with you.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most of the country, as well as the United Nations, refuse to recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city of Judah has a fascinating history of thousands of years.
It is a sacred city of three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and it is a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
Because of the religious significance of Jerusalem, and especially many places within the Old Town, it is extremely popular among tourists.
Jerusalem is rich in places of historical, archaeological and cultural significance, but we will also find fine and crowded trade galleries, cafes and restaurants.
In accordance with the current requirements, Cuban nationals arriving at Ecuador by plane arriving at an international airport or crossing border points are obliged to have an official letter inviting them to Ecuador.
This letter shall be authorised by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and shall comply with certain requirements.
These requirements have been implemented to make migration between the two countries more organised.
Citizens of Cuba who have a permanent residence card in the United States should apply to the Ecuadorian consulate in order to get rid of this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least six months after the date of your travel. To confirm the duration of your stay you need to have travel tickets on both sides/for further travel.
Travel for larger groups is cheaper, so if you travel alone or with one person, try to meet other people and create a four- or six-person group to get a better price for a person.
But it shouldn't be your concern, because tourists are often mixed up to fill the vehicles.
It seems to be a way of convincing people that they have to pay more.
Above the northern edge of Machu Picchu rises a tree peak, which often appears in the background of pictures representing ruins.
The view from the bottom may discourage and the approach is steep and difficult, but most people with an average good condition will overcome this episode within about 45 minutes.
On most of the trails there are stone stairs, and on steeper sections there are rails made of steel ropes.
Despite this, you can expect breath and watch out for the steep parts, especially if they are wet, as they can become rapidly dangerous.
Close to the summit is a very narrow and low cave to pass through.
Taking the example of Karol Darwin, who was here in 1835, the attractions and wild nature of the Galapagos are best seen on the boat.
There are more than 60 cruise ships in the waters of Galapagos that can accommodate between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most people make reservations in advance (all boat accommodation is purchased at the top of the season).
Make sure the agent who makes a reservation for you knows Galapagos well and knows him on many different boats.
This will allow your individual interests and/or limitations to be taken into account when choosing a boat.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Chile was ruled by the Incas, and the natives of Araukana (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last autonomous, indigenous American groups that were not fully absorbed under Spanish-speaking authorities until Chile gained independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the period of the Napoleonic wars, which for several years deprived Spain of a functioning central government), the decisive victory over the Spanish was not until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Ssp. República Dominicana) is a country located in the Caribbean, covering the eastern part of Hispaniola, which is divided from Haiti.
Apart from the white, sandy beaches and mountain landscapes in this country, there is the oldest European city in both America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
At first, the islands were inhabited by the Taino and the Caribbean, and the others used the Arabic language and appeared about 10,000 B.C.E.
Within just a few years of the arrival of European explorers, Spanish conquerors have significantly reduced the population of Tainos.
According to information contained in the text Tratado de las Indias, the clergy of Bartolomé de las Casas, between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquistadors killed about 100,000 people from the Taíno tribe.

Cook Islands is an island country that remains in free association with New Zealand. They are located in Polynesia in the central part of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands scattered across the ocean on an area of 2.2 million km2.
These islands are sometimes referred to as “downland Hawaii, ” since the same time zone is in place in Hawaii.
Although they occupy a much smaller area, some older tourists have been reminded of Hawaii since they were not yet U.S. states, because there are no large hotels and other facilities.
There are no cities in Cook Islands. The islands are made up of 15 different islands; the most important are Rarotonga and Ayutaki.
Today in developed countries, luxury services in bed & breakfast facilities have become almost an art form.
In the upper segment, bed&breakfast facilities are mainly competitive in terms of accommodation and breakfast.
And so in the best facilities of this kind you can find the most exquisite bed linen, such as a handmade shed or a historic bed.
For breakfast you can eat seasonal flavors or specialty of the host.
The scenario can be an old, historical building with antique furniture, cultivated terrain and swimming pool.
Getting in your car and going on a long journey has a great charm because of its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you probably know your own car perfectly, and you are aware of its limitations.
Breaking up a private tent in any size in the city may draw unnecessary attention.
In short, the car is ideal for travel, but rarely for "camping".
You can take the car camping if you have a big minivan, a SUV, a sedan or a van with a decomposed seat.
Some hotels come from the golden era of steam and transatlantic railways – before World War II, from the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century.
It was in these hotels, which often offer excellent kitchens and nightlife, that these famous and rich people were staying.
Old-style equipment, the lack of the latest benefits, and some grateful old age are also part of their character.
Although they are usually private property, they sometimes have heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveler with a large amount of money can consider flying around the world, with breaks to visit many of these hotels.
The mutual hospitality network is an organization that enables travelers to communicate with the inhabitants of the cities visited.
To connect to such a network, it is usually enough to fill out an online form. Although some networks provide an opportunity or require additional verification.
A list of available hosts is then drawn up, printed and/or online, sometimes with references and opinions of other travellers.
The beginnings of the Couchsurfing reach January 2004, when programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but he had no place to stay.
He sent e-mails to local university students and received an avalanche of free accommodation offers.
The hostels are designed primarily for young people – the average guest is about twenty years old – but there are often older tourists there as well.
Families with children do not often happen, but in some hostels separate rooms are available to them.
Beijing in China will host winter Olympic Games in 2022 and will thus become the first city to host both summer and winter games.

Between the end of November and mid - May, most temples celebrate annual festivals, and the exact date depends on the individual calendar of each temple.
Most of the temple holidays are celebrated in the annual festivals of the temples or the birthdays of the governing deity or some other event related to the temple.
The temple festivals in Kerala are extremely interesting, you can see the procession of decorated elephants, the temple orchestra and other celebrations.
The World Fair (now called the World Exhibition or simply Expo) is a great international festival of art and science.
Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to present the world's problems and the history and culture of their country.
International Garden Exhibitions are special events that present flowers, botanical gardens and everything else about plants.
Although in theory they can take place every year (as long as they are in different countries), this is not the case in practice.
These events usually last from three to six months and are organised in areas of at least 50 hectares.
In the history of cinema, many different types of film were used. The most popular is standard 35 mm tape (36 mm x 24 mm negative).
When it ends, it can usually be easily complemented, and the resolution it provides is quite comparable to the current digital mirror.
Some medium-format cameras use negatives of 6 to 6 cm and 56 to 56 mm.
The effect is the resolution almost four times greater than the negative 35 mm (3136 mm2 compared to 864 mm2).
Fauna and flora is one of the most difficult topics for photographers, requiring a combination of happiness, patience, experience and a good match.
Nature’s photography often seems obvious, but just as it is with a photograph at all, one photograph can express more than a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long teleconduct, although objects such as a flock of birds or small creatures require other lenses.
Many exotic animals find it difficult to meet, and reservations sometimes have rules for taking photos for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either shallow or aggressive. It can be cold or hot or the environment can be hostile for other reasons.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than 20 languages that use at least 50 million users.
Words written are often easier to understand than words are spoken. This is especially true in the case of addresses that often make it difficult to try to express them clearly.
Many nations use English in their language, and their limited knowledge can be expected from an even larger crowd, especially among young people.
Imagine, for example, that at a restaurant in Toronto they eat English from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, and Australia.
They deal with each other's stories from their family towns, told with a typical accent and local dialect.
The cheapest way to get food is to buy in a supermarket. If someone does not have the ability to prepare meals, they are sentenced to ready meals.
Prepared meals available in supermarkets are becoming more and more varied. In some shops there is even a microwave or other appliances for heating food.
There are such countries or types of shops where there is at least one restaurant within the supermarket, or rather a dining room, because prices in such places are quite affordable.
Make a copy of the policy and take it with you, along with the insurer's contact details.
They must provide the insurer's e-mail address and international phone numbers to get advice/authorities and create claims.
It is worth having a second copy in your luggage, as well as online, in an email sent to you with an attachment or in a cloud.
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in its memory or on a disk (which you can use without access to the Internet).
Give copies of the policies/contacts to the people you travel with, as well as to relatives or friends who will help you if you need them.
Moose (also called European salmon) is not aggressive in nature, but will defend itself in the face of danger.
If someone does not see the potential danger from the moose, he may come too close and be in danger.
Drink alcohol moderately, and everyone reacts differently, so it's worth knowing your limit.
The potential long-term health problems resulting from excessive alcohol consumption include liver damage and even blindness and death. The risk increases when illegally produced alcohol is consumed.
In the composition of illegal poisons you can find various dangerous pollutants, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small quantities.
Correctional glasses can be cheaper in another country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Think of the sight test on the spot, especially if it covers the insurance, and then take with you a recipe that can be implemented elsewhere.

Coffee is one of the most frequently sold goods in the world, in your family region you can probably find many of its types.
There are so many different ways around the world to drink coffee that it's worth checking out.
Canyoning is a journey on the day of the dry canyon or filled with water.
Although canyoning includes swimming, climbing and jumping, there is no need for intensive training or exceptional condition (which are already necessary for example in rock climbing, diving with aquawalunga or Alpine skiing).
Walking is a journey in the fresh air and in the natural environment, often using marked trails.
Daily trips include distances from less than a mile to longer, which can be spent in one day.
A simple journey along an easy path does not require much preparation, and any person with moderate efficiency will be able to enjoy it.
Families with young children may need further preparation, but the day outside can be arranged easily even with infants and preschoolers.
There are nearly 200 tourism organisations in the world, mostly independent.
Succesor of Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, unites numerous tourism providers from four continents.
It started with Running Tours Barcelona in Barcelona and Running Copenhagen in Copenhagen, then they quickly joined them running Tours Prague from Prague and others.
A lot of things have to be taken into account before you leave, and then on your journey.
When you're on the road, you'll be faced with differences and surprises. Manners, regulations, road traffic, accommodations, standards, language, etc. will be somewhat different from your home country.
You must always remember that if you want to avoid disappointment or even distaste local customs and practices.
The first travel agencies were established in the 19th century. It is worth taking advantage of the offer of the travel agency if the trip includes places where the nature, culture, language or poverty of the traveller has not previously experienced.
Most offices accept standard reservations without a problem, while many agents specialize in specific types of travel, destinations or budget forks.
You'd better use the services of an agent who often organizes trips like yours.
Check out the tours promoted by the agent on the website or on the store website.
If you want to visit the world cheaply – due to the need, lifestyle or as a challenge – there are several ways to do so.
Here we distinguish two essential categories: taking a job while travelling or reducing expenses. This text refers to the second category.
The minimum travel budget is intended for those willing to devote time, time and predictability to reduce spending almost to zero.
The notice accepts that travellers do not steal, do not commit offences, do not participate in an illegal market, do not rib or otherwise do not use other people to profit.
The border crossing is usually the first stop after leaving an aircraft, ship or other vehicle.

In trains with sleeping wagons, the conductor can collect passports so as not to interrupt sleep passengers.
Registration is an additional requirement in the process of applying for a visa. In many countries you should register your presence and address with the local authorities.
This may require the completion of a form at the local police station or a visit to the immigration office.
In many countries, local hotels are involved in registration (check this out).
In other cases, only persons staying outside accommodation must register. However, this makes the law much more misleading, so you have to check it out earlier.
The architecture includes the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are fascinating not only from the outside, as in the case of high-rises or a well-placed window you can admire the beauty of the view from the inside of the building.
The architecture is largely intertwined with other areas of urbanism, land engineering, decorative art, interior design and landscape design.
Many villages are located in isolated areas, so to enjoy intense nightlife, you have to go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all casinos in the list above are served drinks, and some of them have high quality entertainment in their offer (especially large locations in the vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Warning: Local small-town bars are not always friendly places for tourists from other states.
It should be noted that in the northern region of New Mexico, drunk drivers are a serious problem and can most often be found in the area of small-town bars.
Unordered murals or inscriptions are graffiti.
Although this is far from the present phenomenon, most people probably associate it with young people who destroy public and private property using spray paint.
However, there are now recognized graffiti artists, graffiti-related events, and even “legal” walls. In this context, graffiti often resemble works of art, not reading words.
Dumping boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
To learn how to throw a boomerang that goes back to the pitcher, make sure you have that kind of tool.
Boomerangs available in Australia in most cases don't come back after they're thrown.
A meal called hangi is prepared in a heated earth stove.
The earth’s oven is heated with stones removed from the fire and, somewhere, with natural heat from geothermal deposits.
"Hangi" is often used to prepare a traditional dinner consisting of roasted foods.
Several places in Rotoruo provide geothermal hangars, and other hangars can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington and other places.
In MetroRail in Cape Town there are two classes of urban and suburban trains : MetroPlus (also called first class) and Metro (also called third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and not so crowded, although slightly more expensive, it still costs less than normal subway tickets in Europe.
Every train always has MetroPlus and Metro cars; Metro Plus are usually at the end of the train, near Cape Town.
Carrying the luggage of others – always keep an eye on your luggage, especially across borders.
You may not know anything about it, but you will be transporting drugs, which will result in serious consequences for you.
This has to do with waiting in line, because dogs who are drug-trafficking can be introduced at any time without warning.
Some countries impose extremely severe penalties even for first offences, such as 10 years in prison or death.
Baggages left unattended fall prey to thieves, as well as to authorities who fear bombings.
You're in contact with local germs all the time at home, so there's a high probability that you're already immune to them.
However, in these parts of the world, where bacteria are present that your body has not previously had contact with, you are at greater risk of problems.
Moreover, when the climate is warmer, the bacteria grow faster and are able to survive longer outside the body.
Hence the plagues of Delhi Belly, the curse of Pharaoh, the vengeance of Montezume and others related to them.
While respiratory problems occur in colder climates, in hot climates there are often intestinal problems, usually very annoying but not causing risks.
If you travel for the first time to a developing country or to a new part of the world, you can experience a cultural shock.
Many regular, experienced travelers have been overcome by ignorance of travel in developing countries, where many small cultural differences can quickly accumulate.
Especially in the first days it is worth going crazy and spending money on high quality hotels in the Western style, food and services to make it easier to aclimate.
Do not sleep on mattress or floor coverings in areas where local fauna are unknown.
If you're going to camp under the naked sky, take out a field bed or hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals.
Let your house be filled with a rich morning coffee flavor and a relaxing smell of Romanian tea at night.
During vacations at your place of residence, you have more time to please and cook something really special.
If you are willing to make an adventure, do not hesitate to prepare a few freshly pressed juices or smoothie:
Perhaps you will discover some simple drink that you will prepare during breakfast before you are consumed by your daily duties.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, visit bars and pubs in areas where you rarely live.
If someone doesn't know medical jargon, we're informing them that "infectious" doesn't mean the same thing as "infectious".
The infectious disease is caused by pathogens such as virus, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
Infectious disease is easily transmitted if we are close to the infected person.
Vaccinations for various diseases are often a requirement applied by the governments of countries to persons coming or leaving the country.
These requirements may often depend on which country the traveller visited or intends to visit.
One of the great advantages of the city of Charlotte in North Carolina is a large number of high quality attractions for families.
Other residents often say that the main reason for the move is the family climate, and tourists often feel that it is easy to move with children.
In the last two decades, the number of children - friendly attractions in downtown Charlotte has increased significantly.
Families living in Charlotte generally do not use taxis, although in some circumstances this form of transport may prove useful.
More than 2 passengers are subject to payment, so it may be more expensive than necessary.
The coldest place on Earth is Antarctica, located around the southern pole.
Travel costs a lot, requires good physical condition, is only possible in the summer (November to February) and is mainly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Rossa Sea.
During the summer period, about 50 bases in these areas are home to several thousand workers, but only a small number of them live here in the winter.
Central Antarctica is a popular plateau that covers 2-3 km of ice.
Occidental special flight trips take place in the depths of the land for mountain climbing purposes or to reach the pole where the large base is located.
Travers on the south pole (also called the highway) is a 1,600 km long route from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the pole.
After this snow has been killed, only special tractors carrying sleds with fuel and propane can move with ice slots and marked flags.
They are not light and backward, so the long-distance route around the Transatlantic Mountains leads on to the plateau.
In winter, accidents occur most often on slippery roads, sidewalks, and, above all, stairs.
The shoes with a good sole are the base. The shoes usually slip on ice and snow during the summer, and even some winter shoes may not be suitable.
The tread shall have an appropriate depth of 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material shall remain soft at low temperatures.
Some shoes are equipped with a ring, and under slippery conditions there is a cover with rings matching most of the shoes, for wearing heels or soles.
The heels must be low and wide. Better grip is obtained by spraying sand, gravel or salt (a calcium chloride) on roads and paths.
Avalanches are not unusual; as steep slopes are able to maintain only a limited amount of snow, their excess will be sufficient in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky, so something has to cause it to go down, and the snow coming down brings back another mass of it.
Sometimes the original trigger is the sun that warms the snow, sometimes more snow, and sometimes other natural events, often man.
Tornado is a rotating air column with very low pressure, pulling the surrounding air into and out of the air.
They cause strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can carry heavy objects into the air during the tornado movement.
They start as rain forests falling from storm clouds, and when they touch the earth, they become “tornades. ”
VPN suppliers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to circumvent political censorship and commercially filter IP addresses by location.
They are superior to intermediate servers for several reasons: they redirect the entire internet traffic, not just http.
Their typical advantages are higher capacity and better quality of operation. Since they are encrypted, they make spying difficult.
Media companies are lying when, as a target, they say, "prevention of piracy".
In fact, the regional codes do not affect illegal copying in any way; a copy of all the bits on the disk will be well played on any equipment on which the original will be played.
This is really about more control of these companies over their markets and generating large profits.
The calls are made via the Internet, so you do not need to use the telephone operator located at your place of residence or at your destination.
You don't need to get a local number from the community you live in; you can have a satellite Internet connection in the village of Chicken in Alaskan silence and choose a number assigned to the sunny Arizona.
It is often necessary to buy a global number separately in order to be able to pick up calls from public telephone networks (PTSN). The location of the number makes no difference to the telephone population.
Real-time translation applications – applications that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
There are applications in this category that can translate non-lingual texts placed on characters or other objects in the real world when the user points his smartphone at them.
Translation programs have improved considerably and now often offer approximately more correct translations (rarely meaningless text), but be careful because there is always a possibility of error.
Google translator is one of the most popular applications of this type and allows you to translate online after downloading the required language data.
GPS navigation on a smartphone is probably the easiest and most convenient way to move in a foreign country.

Access to these services is often obtained through a free phone number, which can be reached free of charge from most phones.
The rules applied to standard photography apply equally to video recording, perhaps even more.
If you're not allowed to photograph anything, don't even think about filming it.
Before using the drone check what you can film and what licenses and licences are required.
Even when the rules in force in your area do not prohibit it, flying a drone in airspace over an airport or a human collection is generally not indicated.
Air travel is currently rarely booked directly in airlines, instead of first searching and comparing prices.
It happens that the same flight has extremely different prices depending on the flight search, so it is worth comparing different results and checking the price on the airline website before booking.
Although a short tourist or business visit does not require a visa in some countries, if you come as a foreign student, the stay is likely to be longer.

Living and volunteering abroad is an excellent way to learn about other cultures, new people, themselves, and to gain a new perspective and new skills.
It may also be a good way to increase the budget and allow longer stay in some place, as many volunteers offer accommodation and nutrition, and some even a small salary.
Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Part of these routes can still be used. Check that you do not need special permits that may be difficult to obtain.
The Bialomorsko-Baltic channel runs from the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St Petersburg, using rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is connected with the Volga, so today Russia can also be sailed from the Caspian Sea.
You can be sure that when you arrive at the marina, the situation is quite clear. You will meet other water hitchhikers who will share information with you.

Try to talk to as many people as possible, and soon everyone will know you, and they will tell you where the boats are looking for someone.
It is necessary to carefully select an airline implementing the Frequent Flyer programme under the Airways Alliance.
Although you may feel that your intuition is guiding you when you choose the airline you fly most often, you should remember that there are often different benefits offered, and points for people flying are often bigger in a different line from the same group.
Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines are airlines that have significantly expanded their flight offer to Africa, and connections to many of the largest cities in the continent are available at more competitive prices compared to European lines.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has supported flights to 39 locations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check out the total price for travel in Africa compared to the price of travel around the world.
Do not forget to take into account the costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is narrowed due to the lack of transatlantic routes.
No airline alliance shall cover all three transoceanic flights in the southern hemisphere (SkyTeam does not include any of them).
However, the Star Alliance alliance does not only cover the eastern part of the South Pacific, from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which this flight serves the LATAM Oneworld.
If you want to skip the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, there are several other options available besides this flight (see below).
In 1994, in Azerbaijan, the Upper Karabakh region, Armenian ethnically, declared war on the Azeri.
With the support of Armenia, a new Republic has been established, but none of the countries with a well-established position, including Armenia, officially recognises it.
Diplomatic springs continue to spoil relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Holander name: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th century district surrounded by Biennestad in Amsterdam.
The entire district is on the UNESCO World Heritage List in recognition of the unique cultural and historical value, while the prices of the property located here are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, or “Five Krains”, includes five small coastal villages (Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso) located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They're on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have been baking houses on uneven, steep soil, until the cliffs from which sea views stretch.
Part of his charm is a lack of visible development. The villages can be reached by roads, trains, and boats, but cars cannot reach them.
The French-speaking people of Belgium and Switzerland use a slightly different language than the French, but these differences do not prevent them from communicating effectively.
In particular, the numbering in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has specific characteristics which are different from those in French used in France, and another is the pronunciation of certain words.
However, all French - speaking Belgians and Swiss could learn from the French standard school, and they could understand you if you used a standard French numerical system.
In many places in the world waving is a friendly gesture that means "hello".
However, in Malaysia, at least in its rural areas, this gesture means "come forward" and it is similar to that used in some Western countries when calling on someone with an index finger – it should only be used for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may wrongly consider waving his hand to the waver (not to the one he is waving) as a gesture calling for a return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or designed to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have a problem with communication.
They are something other than lingua franca, which are natural or organic languages that dominate for different reasons as a means of communication between users of different languages.
During the hot days, tourists can experience smells that look like water (or other things).
It can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirage, losing valuable energy and the rest of the water.
Even in the worst deserts at night can be very cold. Hypothermia is a real risk if there are no warm clothes.
As you travel through the rain forest, you have to watch out for mosquitoes, especially in the summertime.
When you drive through a subtropical rain forest and open the vehicle door for a few seconds while you're boarding, mosquitoes are enough to become your passengers on the ramp.
Avian influenza (called a professional avian influenza) can infect both birds and mammals.
Few thousand cases have been observed among humans, but some have been fatal.
Most of the cases concerned poultry workers, but birds are also at risk.
The characteristic for Norway are steep fjords and valleys, which suddenly turn into a high, fairly flat plateau.
These plateaus are often called "vidde" – meaning a wide, endless space without trees.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are commonly referred to as “hei, ” which means a treeless wasteland, often sprawled by a rope.
The glaciers are not still, they come from above, and this will cause cracks and cracks that can be covered with snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of the ice cave may fall and the crevices may fall.
On the edge of the glaciers, large blocks roll, falling and perhaps drifting away from their edges.
The tourist season at mountain stations usually reaches its peak during the summer.
In the winter, however, they get a whole new glow and charm, because there is plenty of snow in many mountain stations, so there are attractions such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines continue to offer funeral fares, a little lowering the cost of a last-minute funeral flight.
