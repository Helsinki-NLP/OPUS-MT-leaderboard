Petr Čech: Last-minute pass?
It's possible everything.
Today is the last day you can skip the transfer window and make a big pass.
Another chance comes in winter.
Peter Čech, current replacement goalie of Chelsea, but now he's not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting at the NH Hotel, talking to Czech journalists and is preparing for the Czech team to play with the Americans and then also for a sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's goal in the new season, Premier League takes advantage of Thibaut Courtois, the Czech Republic for the first time in ten years in London's club became a replacement.
Some time ago, there was speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the beginning of the season, he lost his Spanish Super Bowl in battle with Athletics and did not even manage to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
By the season of the French League, he had two wins and two drawbacks, shooting St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club is AS Monaco.
He's got a balance sheet of 1-1-2 in the league so far, and on the weekend he broke up with Lille meekly 1:1.
News came out on the boulevard English websites today that the Czech Republic might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, Czech departure from Chelsea at the last minute is unlikely.
Skybeth wrote a course 4:1 on it.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your jersey during the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Maybe during the day there'll be an offer that won't go away.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know how an offer like that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to be the agreement of all parties, first of all it would have to be Chelsea's position if the club were to decide whether or not to offer.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a move when you're in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new arena?
That's not how I thought about it.
But there are a lot of players in this situation today, everyone's at a team meeting somewhere, and I'm sure there's a lot of oversteps to close today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs are on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing it to leave?
The situation in the first three games of the new season is new to me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack, and leave.
I want to continue to take part in this fight for Chelsea's goalie position, and it's up to the coach who he chooses to make his decisions over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I'm taking all the factors into account.
Of course, the sports aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal page that, of course, includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible you'd catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought it would never be about me.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

According to India's rapporteurs, he also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Police in Karrat after a motorcycle chase arrested a 20-year-old young man
They stopped the engine after the 70 km/h maximum speed zone crashed 125 km/h and drove to the bush to escape the police.
The patrol traffic police tried to stop the blue motor at the border this morning in Karrat when they noticed that when they left the station on Bathgate Road, it was 125 km/h.

George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be tried for rape charges against women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was introduced to the indictment during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Apparently, on 7 June 2013 in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire County was to rape a woman.
According to Webster, he attacked her while “she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent. ”
In addition, Webster was prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the review at the Supreme Court of Edinburgh on 17 November.
Renewal of the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that should protect union organisations as civil law.
"As trade unions function, there are jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud to present, together with the example of occasional rights, John Lewis, a law that strengthens the position of employees.
This breakthrough legislation gives workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and to stop anti-committee forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees facing discrimination, if they want to join unions, to be tried before a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation for damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other drafters are proposing in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans have once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country, with one breath, promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autonomy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions were playing a role in forming a new Japan, incorporating a language into them, and openly recognized that “the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed. ”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that the new nation would need to organize and enforce, so they included a clause that openly states: “The right to form societies that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions for each individual and every profession or profession will be guaranteed.
Arrangements that restrict or seek to harm this right will be repealed.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt guarantee that “everyone has the right to form and enter trade unions within the framework of the protection of his interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and enforce in a free and open society.
Like 50 years ago, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the power unions of the nation have not diminished, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and production up to an unsuspecting level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is much delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which, according to lawyers, would probably shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The regulation, signed by Louisan Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is scheduled to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to receive a patient at a hospital within 30 miles of the exercise of their practice.
The judge’s resolution means that doctors may continue to carry out legal abortions temporarily and in the meantime must obtain this authorisation.
"The proposed party will be able to carry out its activities legally and in the meantime obtain a permit," Federal Judge John deGravelles said in a resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for abortion rights, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the delusional law that is to save them health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics which were not among the defendants and also requested such authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven States that have passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures to be non-constitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion, together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this permission imposes on doctors requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opposers opposed that measures were intended to protect women's health and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to the measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights stated that only one abortion doctor is authorised in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the country were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop the procedure for his safety, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities stated that they would not punish doctors who performed abortions while waiting for an application for rights to be resolved.
Because of late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, the rural cancer kills the ovaries more often.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with the hold of their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis lived.
Research director Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines can slow lung and ovaries cancer
Women's researchers followed the treatment for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in elderly women in whom cancer was diagnosed in an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that the factors could be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease can best treat gynecooncologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving distance medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen the transport service that allows specialists to treat women closer to their homes and programmes to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer was low regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and prevention programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquercancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, when she was 33 years old, Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of houseowners under 35 years of age could lead to the loss of ten million pounds per year to today’s young generation of consumers.
According to the report, people who rent apartments spend an average of 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own gardens.
As other factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimated five billion pounds per year, the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the likeness of landing instead of the suburbs used as a parking area and the decreasing size of gardens.
In the Great London area, where the share of houses owned fell from 61% to 43% within six years, the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain is one household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society stated that living in a rental or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the head gardener for the RHS, said: “In tenants there is a very popular plant cultivation in flower plants - if they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher spending this year due to better weather, which came under adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator speaks of democracy.
After Putin at the gathering of his youth organization, which most reminds me of Hitlerjugend, saved us with nuclear weapons and in fact revealed to all that their views were stolen from him, he gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I feel that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be ruled by both drunken nationalism and the fact that the inferiority complex can transform them into imperialistic tastes.
Time's running out in the east, apparently, different from the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the war on the domination of Europe was long gone, on the other hand, they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the capture of the power of the Nazis and then followed an explosion of nationalism that was not the same today's situation in Russia.
And then the very similar cult of a strong leader, beating up journalists, eliminating inconvenient political opponents, discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that's pretty much the same.
Vladimír Putin and certainly much of the Russians must have missed the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part shook before them.
Maybe the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe few of Vladimir was spanking his shoulder, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian male.
He made an order at home, he looked like he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he was grinding knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back the lost position.
It starts slowly, it's time.
He's probably the leader for life, so hurry up.
He walks the Caucasus, now he walks the Ukrainians, then it's midgets from the Baltics.
They've been pinching Russian bears for a long time.
I'm sure China will notice that, too, who's kind of jumping out a little bit, and he's definitely taking a long way east.
And those Germans of Vladimír are as good a creature as they are, and I put that on their ass at 45.
How about we do a new New Year's Eve in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours there, and as they're pushing them down, they're already trying to knock the lecter out of them.
Our veterans remember how they were in Czechoslovakia until now.
Well, their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be robbed like an onion, and I'll eat their whole EU.
That'd be so much fun if they jumped on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as explosives, we're going to use our fellow countrymen who live in their territory.
There's plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're squeezing them, they just squeeze them in there, and we don't leave them there, we protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is he born to do.
Europe is only as good as a play for a proud Ivan to dance to.
Turkey summons US diplomat for spy news
Turkey's foreign minister has called on the country's highest-built American diplomat to explain the report on US and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that US Charge d'affaires and Turkish government officials acted on Monday's report.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the American National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has bagged the importance of the report and has declared that all major states are watching each other.
An older report, which pointed to Ankara as well as the German intelligence service, sparked a more bitter reaction with the Turkish government.
The series Game of Thrones presented the other tricks of the fourth row
The creators of the Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about the tricks of the fourth row.
The most visible are computer modifications to the serial environment and mass scenes when the noise of the soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
The Head of Police in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants in the self-government area of Calvia to the Office of the Mallory State Prosecutor.
The head of police in Calvia on Mallorca's holiday island was arrested following charges against high-ranking businessmen and bar owners in the notorious party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after being charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street in which most bars and nightclubs are located in Magaluf.
According to Mallorca Diario's Internet journal, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants in the Calvia self-government district of Mallorca Diario on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for connection with the corruption charge and, together with Navarr, the judge will question them.
The Spanish National Gazette of ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of night-time enterprises as having a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't mess with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which provided 24 men with oral sex during a tour of bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to supervise drunkards and outlaws in a number of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcoholic tours at bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and together with tour tour operators at Carnage’s bars pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-influenced accidents, including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
JARO brought South Australia an ice surprise, with heavy rain and heavy wind, which seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm crash is scheduled to take place in the city by nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm falls during the night of Sunday.
The last rain presented itself together with a few short overruns associated with the storm and wind surges that began about eight o'clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few early doses of spring came in last winter, temperatures in the city dropped again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
Storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was to land shortly after 7:30, but at a short distance it was hit by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to land.
Wind surges at Adelaide airport at that time reached speeds of about 50 km/h on the ground.
The flight data showed that the plane had to drop off from the second landing and eventually reached about 20:40.
The delay in the aircraft subsequently caused the delay of other flights, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, Tuesday temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C and one or two excesses may appear.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas rockets and mortars attacked their homes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from fighting.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In Ashdod, a town in the south of the country, the personnel of the rocket - hit kindergarten removed the remains from the wall from the shards and slowly await the return of the children.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a kibbutz resident of Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that it was “a bit strange ” to go back to school.
"We have had some difficult times and we have not left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the inhabitants.
Until the cease-fire of last week's war ended, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, where a Palestinian mortar shot killed a four-year-old boy, with a weight return.
The minister of education said that about 12 families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was severely hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently and added: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
Although the cease-fire led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, it did not solve the key problems as a requirement of Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and to re-open airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the restoration of the bodies of two fallen soldiers in the war.
A new round of indirect action is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates from the Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these allegations.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4591 rockets and mortars during the battles against Israeli cities in the south.
The Israeli army has again taken over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred UN schools that had turned into a commission shelter.
Because of tens of thousands of people who remain in shelters and due to ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will be opened soon so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in Gaza's largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand behind you.
And Lafatou is troubled by the temperature
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague before the central preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
A three - and - a - two - part cadre has problems with a fellow attacker named David Lafat, who is suffering from a fever.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, and it was more players, and David's probably still got a little bit of a problem.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," Coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it is two or three days or there will be a fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it is not such that they cannot train or participate in a match Wednesday with the US," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan magazine Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to make, and other centrifuges were involved.
I decided on the basis that Luke is a promising player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it," Vrbo pointed out to Vácho.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend, for example, the Liberec Joseph Šural, who gave the hattrick, flashed great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata's doing.
If it is not possible to be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who took part in the Czech league," Vrba noted.
This afternoon, there will be a training team on Strahova, and Tuesday, a classic pre-match training before the duel with the US on Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The game with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a premiere victory under Vrbo.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he lost two belts and lost one.
A qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on the program September 9th from 20:45.
He's on foot going to the Netherlands to Italy
The willow is glad that, unlike previous meetings, he has more time for training.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that maybe we haven't had that much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting the best ready for the Netherlands," Vrba commended himself.
The Dutch will introduce themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally follow the former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna have a shot and we're gonna take it apart.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be made there," said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period have risen most over the last seven years.
According to the index, the value of apartments in the Australian capital of the Republic of Poland Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase resulted in a total increase in June, July and August to 4,2 %, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than twice in one year by August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne run the market.
The RP figures show that the prices of apartments in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while prices in Melbourne increased by 11,7 %.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra, which was damaged by the State's ordered expenditure reductions, increased by only 1,4 % during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the persistence of high auction sales rates, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry went through “a thorough ” therapy, and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you heard his voice: “Stop with the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were already adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading the papers.
Henry recently visited Dudley's foundry, and even though conditions were better than their father's time, he saw what life must have been like for him.
There's a little bit more light there today, but it's still a dark, smoked, cloudy maze where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, and then it was like he was slowly singing for himself, because he was cleaning up the brewery.
When I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to feed the family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry experienced childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't find anyone, he said, "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who's with Dawn French, has made it possible for him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight, and the symptoms of diabetes began to manifest, the doctor told me, “You have to make a radical change. ”
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to take a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And tired.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may reflect in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After he got a confession from the critic for his Othella, he went down to the theater.
Followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's fences.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedy that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ spotted him on stage paging someone, and he wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid - 70 ’ s: “For a long time, I was the only black copycat/comik on TV. ”
He was studying for the march.
Besides having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to invent working jokes, to be a star, and to perform on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager possessed the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer theirs for that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years the prized main product of British television” was also “grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who at the same time mocked and celebrated the British Black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to be broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was also known as Chef Gareth Blacklock’s Chef!
For the next decade, he was robbed of advertising, documents, TV shows and movies, but after broadcasting his Lenny Henry.tv show at BBC in 2008, he said, "What are you going to do now, Len, it seems like you're stuck in one place, or you're getting a little out of the way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for a high school white.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said: “You should try it. ”
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othel's final speech for the document, and he was on his way.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
“That’s what it’s about. It’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was tough, and before, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in the Comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was in the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, “You have changed. ”
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the capture of the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them now for ten minutes.”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in character."
Henry in the Plots in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God saying, "You should do this."
OF COURSE HE SAYS IT WITH A SOUND VOICE.
So I'm staying with that.
I really like it.
I'm happy to be in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has the brains of a comedian - our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances when he enters and performs as an impersonator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but it doesn't make me as happy as it used to be.
I asked if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun with acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to light up non-existent employees
Kenya started biometric registration of all its civil servants in order to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to be paid.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after they have left the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars (700 000 pounds) per month on non-existent employees' salaries and upon further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still being made to bank accounts after the death of an employee or after the public administration employee has left, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, reported.
All civil servants must enter the identification centres where their data will be biometrically recorded within the next two weeks, as stated in the government statement.
He further says that anyone who does not arrive without sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
"By identifying real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economic recovery and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a “conspiracy against the government. ”
The police department hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking officials in custody.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time of the Prime Minister) marked their actions as part of the actions of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told present journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held traditional ceremonies until 1st September.
No, there's peace in all of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, visited by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, maybe the BBC found a hard-time boss.
It brings with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves conservative parties.
Sam has experience in front lines.
Her career began in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the Pearsons media world.
For seven years she was the executive director of the Financial Times. She resigned when the highest position in Pearson's mother's company was occupied by her younger colleague.
It's said that her distance was about a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became an advisor to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's job as a poison cup.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC's own hierarchy, but also out in a public voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires thorough reform.
Which, however, would risk coming to a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, decomposing it and thereby losing themselves to work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would love to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition circle and new technology questioning old security, it carries with it the immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC is in great danger.
For a modest amount of £145,50 a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96 % of households, each costing only 40p a day.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53 % of the supporters compared to 31 % ten years ago.
Models of using BBC services have changed: Today the headlines show up on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the abusive tweet did not approve
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic state attorney initiating Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published in Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that wasn't authorized left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I withdrew it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unfavorable, humorous picture of the state representative Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013 for driving intoxication.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which brought Perry, a potential candidate for president in the 2016 elections, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet said: “I don’t always drive three times the level of alcohol in my blood... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry for calling me responsible. ”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg Authority.
He was taken over by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge to dismiss the case because the use of law to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off $7.5 million from the state's public interest defence fund, which has its headquarters in Travis County, and prosecutes corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint by a left-handed group of civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it will be celebrated.
After he finished fifth in his party committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he could have finished, tweeted with his own picture of him running near the lake, and said, “Here I am, South Carolina! ”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is going back to normal.
One of London’s most prominent development companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England had “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and increased concerns about the credit bubble led Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's demanding client company, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the peak in 2013 to the normal level of transactions.” He adds that it provides a "stable environment for functioning".
London’s housing market was well under way during the downturn, as shoppers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the data of the cadastral office, prices in the city rose by 18,5 % only last year and far exceeded the average of 6,7 % in England and in all Wales.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and rose to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pounds, foreign buyers of London's real estate are not so attractive in recent months - some of them have also threatened to introduce new real estate taxes and talk about possible "sedation taxes" with which politicians came before next May's parliamentary elections.
Last week, the London Real Estate Office Foxtons warned that the April review of the mortgage market, which presented stricter lending rules, would also slow down the pace of market growth in real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
On Monday, the new data from Bank of England showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
The Hamptons International, another real estate office, has fallen on the basis that house prices have already begun to decline, its forecast of rising prices of London real estate for 2015 to 3 %.
The volume of transactions, according to the WA Ellis Realtor's Office, has decreased by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in Berkeley's capital was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well - looking housing in a good location remained the same, and this kept the forward sales going. ”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40 % to 380 million pounds, by 18 % to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley, he said that it is expected that Berkeley’s annual income will be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley stock stopped at 23.96 pounds in the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posted naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
The photos of Oscar's owner Jennifer Lawrence escaped to the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of hundreds more starting actresses.
"Hunger Games" movie star speakers confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and criticised the hacker for "the apparent violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server allegedly obtained the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, thanks to the gap in the Apple iCloud web repository system.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world” Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in private homes years ago are satisfied with ourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" TV series, denied that the photos would be real.
It's better to cut it even in the budget.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that pop star speaker Ariana Grande had denied that the alleged photos would be real.
An extraordinary example of Howard Jacobson’s famous new novel about love and the letter “J”
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrating like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complicated, harsh, isolated, and perhaps a little edgy.
And then she shook his hand.
He's scared to death.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a love affair, which more than usual promised to ease his loneliness and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and unholy than Port Reuben.
In the south came an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house in a few years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the snails slobbering on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage of children's stories, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the preliminary list of nominations on the Man Booker Prize 2014.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and held hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, unabatedly setting up a public station that provided comforting music and comforting news when the sighting of her burnt-crossed legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to hear with the covered blinds.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radios.
They weren't banned - nothing was really forbidden - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into the decade, just like the very word desuetudo.
Human taste has proved what would never have proved to be rules and positions outside the law, and, like people about books, they choose memoirs that make the poor rich, the cooks, and the love novels, so they choose ballads in music.
Kavern was torn down by day and began to play the imaginary piano and the rough, comical voice singing serenade to Aileen's great feet.
Ailinn didn't get it.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically attached two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was little.
His father told him that he played the game with his father.
You didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny at the time, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn's never heard of one.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't built directly outside the law, they weren't playing.
Improvisation is out of style.
There was only one "if" place in life.
When she started playing the tunes, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
It's the same in humor.
His unpredictability went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed by a song.
Even though he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when favorite singers weren't black.
No laws, no pressure.
A loose society is one in which each part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were fit for play and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature, were responsible for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed were washing dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while what happened was that they were afraid of being accused of putting them into the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would eat them the next time they opened a restaurant where the swan was selling and smoking water smokes, not paying attention to themselves, and the inactivity was slowly eating them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could have been produced from the dirty words that Kavern had just been singing to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they are not dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of security.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproof leaves.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He was saying it was a joke, but he was afraid to put two fingers to her mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said in the end.
She shook her head unbelievably and shaded Kever's view.
All over the world, there was nothing to see but the mess of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big a leg?
He looked again.
My feet aren't so good.
Maybe some ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracted to me right now," he tried.
I'm kind of weird.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often put him in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons's radishes and got out of bed, dropped the radio and spilled the unsoaked wine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
She seemed to shake in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
“I’m sickly attracted to you being an idiot,” she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
She felt sorry for both her unkind words and the fear she had in her eyes when she confronted him.
Did you think she was gonna get hit?
She didn't talk to him about living on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was basically the same as here.
It was the same wide and icy ocean.
The same confused men, after what happened, were even more touchy and squeamish than their ancestors, smugglers and misfits, wandering madly from the pub to the pub, ready to reach out to any woman who dared to refuse them or laugh at them.
A fool?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First anoint her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio creaked - first anointed her, then one murderer.
According to Kevern's opinion, over-cultivation, because cuddling itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt frustrated herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave - as if she were watching him from the window on the floor - a man who was caught up in what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She was heartbroken for him and for all the men in general, no matter how many beat her up.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hung, embarrassed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember the only moment that she'd ever seen it today?
Ailinn Solomons, alone, looked at her feet.
Some 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic two-twenty-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderately serious violent acts in areas of the country where it has been reduced or stopped directly, was most expected to have enough money and energy spent on its removal.
“A lot has been done and much more must be done,” she wrote, “to calm down the inherent aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and have won most of them, especially in the remote, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the church towers rising above the living fences of the breaths of human kindness, only rarely appeared.”
Some things, however, are irreplaceable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the points.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, swallowing unhappy stories and proclaiming that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality is held as hard as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that at home, on the workplace, on the roads and even on sports grounds there is new and offensive intolerance.
"Unfortunately, you tend to have too little style," her superior said.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme has a right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Next quiet.
“I’m not asking therefore,” said Rabinowitz, “that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unimpeded companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and commendable, can at times distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are predisposed to the church - things you call “crushing” and“ brutal” could also be interpreted as expressions of natural strength and energy.
To keep figuring out what happened, when it happened, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, it was preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
On the light board, he had a pink - headed recommendation that Ofnow had sent to the world for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to be silent, a sung word is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I totally understand your reservations,” Esme Nussbaum answered quietly when she was sure that her superior had finished, “and I no longer claim that the wound had not healed as we say it had healed.
My main concern is that if we do not notice this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, if this happened.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
This was to mean endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps that your grandparents may have taken and may not have done as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting your “angry ” and“ mistrust ” on “the rest. ”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that it was chaotic times.
“In whom, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “we are no one to blame.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it's fair or not, what happened happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that can be seduced, there are no things that should be corrected, not even if correction is appropriate and possible.
But for what else is the past but to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to that...
Luther Rabinowitz dissipated the tip of his fingers.
"I will take your report into account," he said and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on the sidewalk in a way that the passersby described as “crushing and furious. ”
Accidents happen.
The Lesoth Kingdom Army says no coup plans - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Armed officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government and claimed to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After he announced that he was being threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighboring South African Republic.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, the spokesman for the army, said that it was not really a coup, but an army response to the threat of “political fanatics” that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the leadership of the defence elements of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several information services reports that there are several groups in the ranks of the police who are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to do it in the country of the trigger," said the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action seemed like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that they have seized government power by force, they all seem to bear the actions of the Lesothoian defence components of the sign of coup d'état," he said.
The soldiers of the Kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and were at peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane claimed to be the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended Parliament's meeting on internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He stated that despite the contrary, he did not undermine his government’s actions.
Production in the euro area is on a 13-month minimum
Production growth slowed to a 13-month minimum, according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final index of purchase managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
The number above 50 marks expansion.
New orders have passed and factories have damaged growing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The numbers come from a Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and with the threat of inflation staging at 0.3%.
Speculation has emerged that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to that to which the United Kingdom and the United States joined during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the brake effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's main economist.
Germany’s production of PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has once again moved from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to bring oil into the fire of analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing that can be said about the production of purchasing managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: The producers in the euro area are currently living a very difficult life because increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has been amply affected - especially by consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those costly ones.
He said that as “even more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of living hell from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the school occupied children still suffer
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals at Beslan School in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people
During the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during school atrocities
Just ten years after the terrible school in Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, were warned last night by surviving heroes of the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists were captured and murdered by children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resisting the tragedy brought the east and the west together, leading to action and the future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during school atrocities.
We found amazing young people who resisted the misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined school gym
She was caught by Russia's leading photographer, Dimitri Beliakov, trying to get back into the bombarded school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
Confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
I had blood on my feet.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was saved by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she was fully healed, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to do another surgery.
I've got some scraps left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly has not destroyed it," she said with determination.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jerry Gapoev, were killed there.
When we were kids, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the capture, but memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet as I walk through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped with the rain of bullets and believed that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at seven years old) and survived the class siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I would lie on the ground and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, he was running, and he saw a crying toddler on the way, he grabbed the kid by the arm, and they ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother is dead. ”
He says: “I couldn’t save her. ”
As a matter of fact, Tamara was reaching for freedom and was lying in a hospital with a wounded leg and, on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing newspapers News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blaire and his wife Cherie declared a winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are fading.
I remember right after I dropped all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games, and I don't have a problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say that they were killed or that they died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I was able to choose whatever I wanted in toys and how I was driving a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he suffers from war just like he suffered from his friends.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who participated in volunteering in the monastery last week.
I want to be very helpful.
I want to work with the police one day, and I hope I'm admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children here screaming and running, and it took a few months quietly.
He remembers the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though she's ten years old, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste in borscht, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still don’t think the world has changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think there have been, and a lot of kids are going to be killed.
They're just like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and he goes to the gym every once in a while, and they light candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember how he used to lie on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lay there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I've been sure he's dead for hours and I'll never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and I saw hell, and there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember yelling ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced that he had not heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from the others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photograph taken after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Comfort: The survivor of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was in his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my boy stayed there for three days alone," she recalled.
Not entirely alone because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As that date approaches, it's still harder to think about it and talk.
It won't be a day before we remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: The photo of Grigoria (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like looking at that picture, and at home we have it hidden in the library.
I understand that, but I also think that because of that image, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but the truth is never known.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, nobody wants the war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes tens of years to forget a little bit.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had a nightmare attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why when September 1st comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is history.
I won't forget that, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavka.
I want to be a cardio surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was being held at the feet of a terrorist killer
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a terrorist killer during the attack, yet he survived
When the attack was complete, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It's a miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregorius, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me. It's not something I threw away.
Now I'm older and they say that kids with bad experiences can handle things better - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I went to see a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - this was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go back there again and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that well-known picture.
Survival: Gregory Farniev today, on the laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I bring it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I've hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn't enter and study at the FBS Academy in Petersburg for health reasons, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My next favorite is animals, so I joined the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows. ”
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something the kids should know about, and it's not something they should experience anymore.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will be here all the time.
He's inside getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'm going to attend the memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigory can't.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's an adult today, but he's carrying on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so unjust happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's already over 50% of the horror, but to get over it completely and not to forget.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families where other children have been born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even though you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world - wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away, we could go as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who has taken a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is being taken to a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
The world caught a breath in 2004 when a little Alyon was taken from the Beslan capture of a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30 - year - old mother, ten - year - old sister Christine, and brother Makhar in the gym.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyon’s mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother, Ruslan, remarried and their new wife, Svetlana, had a girl named Christine after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that “it is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from memories that reminds us of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to get better photos and videos under the water
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact like Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a couple of cameras, all cost less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Although you have a watertight camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next, set the camera according to which type of photos or videos you will obtain.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you go into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in normal and watertight design.
Always take a few pictures - not a lot of them come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that help you with your photo composition, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it's going to look bad under the water and the composition of the video will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different dispersion of exposure, use this.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper sink of light, it fades significantly.
If possible, stick to taking pictures in the pool, lake or sea close to the level.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimer light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength has changed things even in a huge organization like NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from pain caused by sickness and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the overwhelming majority were interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He faced the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and included Juliet’s wife with remorse.
He noted: “I want everything to happen sooner than later. ”
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague did an X-ray on his chest.
Once two weeks before, he skied in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the contusion or pulmonary emphysema.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, asbestos exposure, a building material previously referred to as “miraculous, ” is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came in close contact with it, such as the builders, builders, carpenters, and shipbuilders.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that's not the kind of complacency you're looking for.
It appears that the mesothelioma epidemic is on the rise in Britain today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the United Kingdom
The reason why we only feel its effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades before mesothelioma develops.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern just veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases is still present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in the schools we study, and in the shops we shop in.
Mesotheliom therefore does not respect social strata, wealth, profession, or age.
The privileged gardens from London’s shopping houses to public schools do not constitute a refuge.
And Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even hospitals where we should be treated are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even take isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have gotten in touch with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries are going to get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question that he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who were then shown a mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis for so long is not normal.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Illness is always fatal.
Now, then, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are sick with the same disease? ”
According to the leading British expert on the mesothelioma of Professor Julian Pet, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them now have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
In a brief look at the records from the courts’ archives, to which the disabled often turn and demand compensation, shows how widespread the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June was admitted by Marks & Spencer to exposing asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two shops in the clothing section - one of the places was a flag ship company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when M&S started working.
She's got two kids today, over 20.
“Before it happened, ” he says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in my dream he might have anything to do with me.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
His name was derived from his fibrosis structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still consider it a ‘big health risk’ that can cause death.
But more dangerous is brown asbestos (amassit) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]. ”
The employee of Marsk & Spencer was exhibited in an asbestos store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that “a significant part of mesothelioma without known asbestos exposure at work or at home was likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment. ”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the ‘current use and ventilation’ of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
Goddard Consulting, who examined Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government need not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report according to which service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as "strong air current".
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although Parliament's Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace receive a ‘positive medical certificate’, it now takes one million pounds and several years of work for Parliament to be thoroughly examined, electricity upgraded and asbestos removed, and that after the 2015 elections, Members would rather sit in Queen Elizabeth's Conference Centre than on the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several rules. ”
It is impossible to say whether this disagreement will cost lives.
Everyone can wait now.
One person who has never been able to determine when asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was demonstrated,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was in the middle of an operation at night.
All of a sudden, I'm shaking.
It came out of nowhere.
I've been having a terrible time.
I thought I wasn't driving home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the ceiling, the swelling around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think it was a mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors x-rayed his chest and gave him a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after exercising and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came into surgery and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and got in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his scans of CT and X-ray with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the chest cavity and lung lining.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't that worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was a mesothelioma. ”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with sisters from Macmillan Charities and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the tube," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to develop a disease.
Mesothelioma therefore now begins to apply to younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous thermally insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
Of course, members of staff who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could be saved, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed today.
The disciples of Bunsen's Kahan built on asbestos pads
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and councilmen for his excellent insulating and insulating qualities.
In schools, too.
In fact, many asbestos people have already been exhibited at school.
In countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos base.
Websites dealing with asbestos in schools have been developed.
The harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s when she was fighting a garden house.
So be careful how you fight the garden house.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while before you know it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I was gonna have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor's position to a patient's position.
Like countless patients before him, he also remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking: “Well, I won’t live another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what sustains us in life - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos is small fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers inhale, they can settle in the sepulchre, the pulmonary ostrich.
Asbestos fibers are irritable and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inspired asbestos fibers shaped like needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxically leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treats other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
He's been invasive from the start.
On mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work that much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is discussed passionately.
Some say she'd be worth a try.
The treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the sepulchre," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “does not respond too much to chemotherapy, ” which, although“ has some effect, ” does not cure.
"Sometimes there will be someone who will survive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they'll all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After the mesothelioma was detected, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and advisor to the equally disabled.
When they called, he cheerfully said: “Hello, you have reached the center of cancer. ”
"He was very positive," Abbott said.
He was diagnosed four years ago and still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and probably only a month longer.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “could show things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the Breast Surgery Department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they examined me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request, and they'd have to approve his payment.
For patients with mesothelioma, money is a key issue to get the best treatment available.
But when different treatments eventually fail inevitably, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why he goes to court and wants compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," Morgan says.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that its very small amount could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled down, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure in Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, the spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Leading exposure to lethal asbestos to one company or instead of work - usually decades after that - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or failed.
The insurance records have been lost.
And those who are now defending themselves with charges have time on their part, which their prosecutors certainly don't.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was approved this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation even if it is not possible to monitor their former employer.
The Act created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80 % of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - approximately 120,000 pounds.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement written by insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time were not reached and people with mesothelioma would be able to track down former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps. ”
But Penning and Morgan admit that in view of the seven deaths, there was a need for prompt action every year.
"People suffer too much and need help right away," Penning said last December during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskio for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasura, he thought had a positive effect.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed the operation - triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott's got it all worked out.
"Of course, that is not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The checkups showed no signs of the disease.
I went to another checkup in March [2014].
I had several stains in my chest [cancer].
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It doesn't endanger life.
It's taking him.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of the tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing my wife how the boiler alarm works.
If you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant that I would never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by the hope or mesothelioma of a chance to survive.
The disease brings with it (and ultimately also brought Stephen Jay Gould) unhappiness.
According to Andrew Morgan, “mesothelioma does not endanger life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the authority to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite the mounting debate on democratic reform Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began to organise and prepare only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It did not surprise us, but it made us angry," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong were lying.
And it's clear we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Li Fei National People's Congress said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain has returned the administration of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that, starting in 2017, the people will be able to vote for the executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows for direct voting, but also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold tight the process of nominating the committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are followed by the movement of the Occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial district if Beijing did not grant them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organisers announced that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks wave protests would begin.
However, they did not provide any further details; they obviously wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organisers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step if all the options for dialogue were exhausted and there would be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that today all the options for dialogue have been exhausted and the Centre's deployment is inevitable.
Officials in Hong Kong have been preparing and strengthening the protection of the government's headquarters all day long in Beijing's announcement and have deployed police and barricades on Sunday.
Inciting unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are shifted by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people are criticizing the movement of the occupation of the central and say that their demonstrations are endangering the trade - a lifeboat of Hong Kong.
"The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people participate and how long," says political Regina Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We don't want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
The Chinese state media has also in recent days come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong draw as Western-controlled subversive agents.
In summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
Pre-election agility?
The league in Jihlava bears the name according to the political movement
There are about 1,600 amateur athletes playing a small dig in the regional town of Highlands.
And their highest competition is newly named The Jihlava League Together.
The name was given according to one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the ten on his candidate is the boss of a small dig in Jihlava Jan Dark.
"There was a general crowd where there was no problem with it," said the Dark One.
The situation around the first league of small diggers has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended changing the grant distribution system.
A small dig took place last year according to the city's website about a million crowns.
And this year it's hundreds of thousands.
According to the law, there is no procedure of small digging in contravention of the law or of the magistrate's directives.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules on grant and grant allocations," said the spokesman for Radek Tulis.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express it as a small kickback in the elections of one political party, it is unlikely that this will be possible.
A high-level "big" football demand similar to that of politicians has not yet come up.
That it would be possible to create a CzechSSD regional overrun, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and all that competition?
I wouldn't go for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be approached by sponsors from a number of companies," said the president of the Regional Football Association, Miroslav Vrzaček.
The head of the small football other side and the movement in the name of the league won't let go
According to the players, small kicks would deserve this sport in Jihlava their own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the playground on the Stoupes is not ours, we are there for rent," pointed out Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava Club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, for example, a senseless area for skaters who are about 50 in Jihlava," the Dark said.
The recipient of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small mine uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupá, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports facilities in schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think huge progress has been made in recent years for a small kick," added Vysal.
Other political parties in league names will not appear according to Jan Dark.
We have limitations.
If someone in one field enters our partnership, we don't put the other one there anymore," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Councilman Karel Voldán.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Dark is using the Small Kicked Jihlava Association and the city's subsidies for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition enters university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to make the best possible impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport opportunities including private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also declared that the service had its own security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to seeing with our VIP (very important fresher - very important freshman) options this year to ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
The speaker said that since the services had only just started, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks. ”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual school fee of 9,000 pounds, it expects that the service will find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIP program is precisely the right way to achieve it.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is impossible.
Many students entering the university this month must be able to cope with the financial crisis before firing thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting into the dorm, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists stand up to racism and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson events
At the beginning of the month, he killed an officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
Those who are waiting for a funeral with their hands up are chanting: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of an unarmed young man, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, Caucasian feminists prefer sex to race.
With increasing tension in the Mediterranean, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noted that the reaction of white women is 100 % focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women shortly after the shooting on August 9th, personal articles with titles such as “the thinking of a white woman over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
"I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privilege at such a level," she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially won that they had to draw attention to it.
According to an English professor at the Ohio University of State, Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light problems that African American women have to face every day and that are not perceived as "female issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish on Facebook funny stories from my life with my partner and get 150 characters from people around the world," Mitchell said.
If I write something about colored being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no question between race and sex dichotomy.
According to her, black women could not afford to see the luxury of sharing these problems with each other: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female professor and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was in almost all cases the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
For reasons of lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery's division between whites and blacks came when a fighter for electoral law like Susan B. Anthony explored at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have election rights.
"They decided to stake the voting rights for women and to focus on the right for blacks later," said Hattery.
When we realize this, we'll get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped blacks protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained election rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell's recitation of white feminists' reactions to the questions that Ferguson raised - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "find" the questions that blacks faced for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists on these premises [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian who demanded that white Americans protest racism more strongly.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions about the race that differ significantly from public opinion polls - will strive for change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America are matoma.
An expert from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “more vulnerable than their sisters, ” but Steinem’s remarks to Ferguson’s side face the criticism that she had already caused.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Spaniards, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The attitude of the police towards the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore in the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youths in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform - this time as a women's issue - has arisen again.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order for the issue to be presented as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," Mercada says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them will find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a reputation in women's organizations," she said.
Pig residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it published it was resting on it in the pig's living room.
One room separate house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of a living room in which he rests with his head on the floor of a pig.
Connells' real estate office said that the pig in the photo is a pet owner.
"The picture was found there by mistake, and that is why it has already been removed," the spokeswoman said.
In the real estate information Connells described the former prayer office as “a single single one-bedroom house.”
Although the office removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house aroused interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has the city in the southwest of the fresh millionaire.
Harvey's lottery player gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, and one lucky man will take $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery home.
The traffic in Harvey was the second time in five years, the last one in November 2009 was to win one million dollars.
But a lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the whole town in southwest Perth is talking about winning.
It's the main theme and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was to touch.
Eight winners in West Australia last month divided one win, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in West Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL marked the protest as a warning strike for which it deliberately chose time outside the traffic peak.
In the chosen time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend to the railway until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people arriving for work during the day," the union said on Monday morning in a press statement to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight, less already passengers," the GDL added.
The official reaction to the strike announcement has not yet been published by DB.
It is not even clear how the protest event will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions require an increase of five per cent of the driver's wages and a reduction of two hours a week.
Currently, the average driver's salary is between 36 000 and 46 000 euros (998 000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to enter into salary growth when working hours are cut.
They stress that the remuneration of drivers must develop as well as with other railway personnel, for which DB is not counted by the reduction of the working week.
The threat was that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at the Barum rallye
What exactly happened?
It was a material flaw.
The car was brand-new, so I didn't think anything like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been repaired in a transparent way and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would have replaced it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we still had two more heresies ahead of us, and we couldn't.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've done five full speed tests.
What impression did you have of them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over the screw.
It's all been caused by the fact that we've been taping the car for over six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You set him off so you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The job didn't come in any more.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of did not come to light.
But it's Barrumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one in the class who dropped out of the championship fight early.
He also had foreign favorites Breen, Abbring, or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have given up?
Yes.
Especially for the audience, it was a shame, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, who is preparing for the car, has moved on for a long time.
But he's paid to get off the track and pick up a nearly two-minute mango.
How pleased were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degree of the winners.
He was on his first two days.
But even Mira confirmed that the car was well-prepared.
It was very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the Barum rally.
Can you make a good sense of driving a regular participant in a rally race?
Not at the moment, I'm sure.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't.
I've decided to take her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I guess I'll go for it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
We've run to some extent because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or strangers, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Bartender?
The team's moving on.
We're going to Vyskov next week, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much around here.
Plus, he wants to borrow from us the Honz Sykora Fabia.
With Mira, we have a European dual-station in Switzerland and in Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica rally was in the world championship, you scored fifth in the show.
Doesn't it tempt you to try that track again?
He's not.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been given a medical certificate of incapacity that serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform your work for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
After that, it was agreed that the days in question would be registered as vacations, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent to take a leave in writing, this procedure has been proven in practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you have no agreement to confirm.
Later, the alleged consent to draw leave, as in your case, may be denied and the absence at work may be regarded as a long-term unexcused absence, thus the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship under § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a legal dispute concerning a contract with the employer, you thus lack proof to prove it.
The working relationship with you but has not been cancelled according to § 53, you only have given the days given in the bill as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence in the bill of lading does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to obtain material security in unemployment), but it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit a doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there is indeed an injury that has caused you to be incapacitated (it is not a ‘unintelligible’, it is only a doctor’s document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of written medical certificate of incapacity and the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to draw leave.
You'll avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track.
Back on the track ended up for Tony Stewart just a little bit behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
Stewart ran into the fence the second time after his right front tire broke down in 172.
Stewart brought the car down to the garage, didn't express himself to the reporters, and left.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said Car 14 team is disappointed, but he's now going to focus on the Richmond race in Virginia that's going to take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do better there.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Bush, which called for repairing the right side of his car.
"We had hoped for a good end to today's race," said Johnston, adding, "it just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation into a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who led Stewart in the race.
The authorities said investigating the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The triple champion faced warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked on 10th and then even on 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, with Busch's car no.
18 he got out of control, came out of the second corner, and ran into Stewart, which sent both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but retreated to 21st place.
Prague chooses new taxi station managers, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the tendering procedure for the new taxi service station managers.
For 103 parking stops, he gets about 12.3 million crowns a year.
Until recently, 150 thousand crowns were selected for the same places for taxi drivers.
Councilman Lukas Manhart (TOP 09) informed of this.
In the past, the city used drawing when selecting administrators.
The winner then received rent for a flat amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
It currently decides on the level of the tender.
"The year since the cancellation of the original leases and the opening of the tender procedures has proved that the new rental system is far more favourable and generally more fair for Prague," the Council said.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštín
The highest price was offered by the applicants for a site on Na Perštín Street.
He'll pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for places outside the General House or at the Vaclav Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the Council in autumn 2012 and declared the original leases last summer.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and 29 seats were found by the new administrator.
This is the second time we've had to clean a well this year.
We let her out every time, which created a practically second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo in there.
It's an incredible smell!
Our well in the basement has always been enough beautiful scented water.
And that wasn't very professional, Grandpa broke it out with his help.
A long time ago.
She was only on three laps, and she was as savvy as anything else in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we didn't think the water smelled.
We were wondering if anything had fallen in there.
In the place where the pump was going through, it was possible in a little bit of bad luck, the board wasn't quite there, so there was a hole sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we lit it all the way down.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we've improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a package on the ground with some dice.
At least that's what it looked like.
And another piece.
Now it looked like an icy mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the spirits, Grandpa's invention, were the remains of the fish!
And it's hard to drive!
Our basement's tough, too.
Someone would say that Grandpa just buried the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only suffocating sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
They're mostly ships.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with wide gaps was largely open as someone walked there in one piece.
On the ceiling, a few of the breaths already mentioned.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the porches.
It's unnecessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to work, and that's it.
Now, of course, the luft didn't even help.
The whole basement smells.
So we cleaned the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the porch was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, heracite boards, and so on.
Our long-distance cottage welcomed a passing disinfectant.
We were thinking, who could've dragged the disgusting remains in there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here.
It's hard for her to come to our place for a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who wasn't totally okay.
If he didn't blow the crap out of Franta?
He's been here almost a year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to guard the basement and the well and regularly control it.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well isn't anything I'd like to do for a while.
One day we heard our wife's creepy, anxious jaw.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
She'd jump over it and scream like a fool.
My mom extorted her because she thought Réza was digging up a garbage can from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially rolled into the ball and partially straight out.
The balcony was covered with soot.
Rizza's had a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The hedgehog, over a metre long and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad and Réza was defending it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the hedgehog saw the power of our entire family, she may have asked us to eat it when we were so hungry, and she elegantly extended her breath into the basement.
We went to see her.
She jumped over the well like a lightning bolt.
By the way, we've recorded another smelling package on her board.
Smells like fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little shading.
And we locked that basement up during the day.
That he would...
We went out, and there we all fell into one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's embarrassing behind the well.
First came a flat head with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole rope went to the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and started to get inside.
A fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
A warm employee bought a computer company after his release and then sold it.
He was able to spend his money before the police were arrested.
In a short period of time, a man bought a total of 16 computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After his takeover, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said Chief Commissioner of the Busper Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on employers for their release and also profit from the money.
"When interviewed, he claimed that he had used money to repay loans," Brückner said.
The police also found out that the fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated in psychiatric care.
Money could also end up in winning instruments or in videolotterial terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money in him," the commissioner said.
A fraud who's already been punished for stealing is now facing a prison sentence of one to five years.
The police have not yet announced whether the punishment is also threatening the bazaars who bought the laptops at a price and sold them further.
"It is true that they were taking over brand-new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner noted.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers prepared a number of changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the target to the swimming pool instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally treat our readers at the booth where we took pictures and recorded videos together.
To reach perfection, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
Along with my friend Katya, we obediently placed ourselves at the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes before we started.
We greeted friends who passed by us in the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sportstesters, countdown and start!
The screams of brightness, but instead of a quick start, followed by a bath at the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, I'm turning on the measurements, and we're moving at an hour and an hour and a half.
We connect with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, all of them look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky provides a view of Vyšehrad almost to the kneading breath.
The pulsating meat running along the coast looks like the whole of Prague is running around here.
On the beach between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light hill on the Palace Square forces many runners to slow down or to take a walk.
Just before moving to the Theatre, I see a police escort and right behind him is Vitek Pavlište flying at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I can hear the lovely sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the line, I encourage him, he's going to spank me, but just before that, my leg will shake and our hands will slip.
The theatre street sequence gives you a chance to take a short break and breathe.
There's a need, there's a place ahead of us where my prospects will blow out.
The turn of the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
The first snack comes with a moment of truth.
During the crossing of the road Katja will squirm at the curb and perform the jump swim.
I see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues along the Goat alley, it is one of the lowest points of the track, although there is no such rush in this stage of the race, but there is a need to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I still don't know that the term "the lowest place" gets its true meaning later.
We are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners behind the Dust Gate.
I'm trying to applaud anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata, because ten cheers with fans is like half an energy stick.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and even though we've fallen pretty bad, now the race is on.
We're ahead of dozens of runners, when I'm passing someone especially tired, I'm trying to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one's ahead of us after the last snack. We're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but it really needs to be removed.
The sun has fallen slowly, and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run to the bridge, the turn, and only a straight line to the finish line.
The pace we're running, I'm surprised where it comes from in this girl.
"Come on, let's go under 13 o'clock, let's go!" I call.
We're trying, we're printing, and there's a target.
An hour of 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set the limit for an hour and a half.
So seven minutes under schedule.
Which is a great result.
Close to get Katya to break her legs, I'm helping her to the rails where she's resting for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well - performed performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't let us think about the pressure in the passageways to the dressing room.
It's obvious here that the Goat Street wasn't the lowest place.
That's all he's here for is a flood that's under the pressure of nearly 10,000 runners stuffed to crack.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for them.
I'm losing my head after a while, too, and I'm wondering if those wonderful views and the more interesting route than last years were worth what was going on in the finish line.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If 10,000 people are added to this, the rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed many interesting places for runners, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere spread in the Yellow Baths was transferred between the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random viewers were stepping on each meter of the track.
Unfortunately, during the city's run, the historical centre must count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on the one hand bordered by the wall and on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say the race is over with the goal, I consider it very well behaved.
For my purpose, I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but in the end, everything turned out well.
Write us a discussion as to whether you liked the route and how you feel about the situation in the finish line.
Bulgarian Prison Supervisors Organise Protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand to reintroduce the original working conditions that had recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The month’s overseers symbolically protested against new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty - four - hour shifts.
Although prison supervisors' unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, they informed the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The proceedings are still ongoing," said BNR head of the Directorate-General for Prison Services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Trade Union Workers' Organisations at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write best sellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University got a shot at black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thickness of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unify two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is that in the case of finding a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physical fundamental problem between two key theories (although at this time our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solves so imaginably that it is worth retelling and laymen.
Greene, in addition, advised so much freshness and affectionately that he could not count on how interesting he had not included in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in the other two books: Structure of the universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object if his book were to be taken more quickly, but the fact is that after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be just a little bit more alive in this area (maybe because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Greene's unviolently open door to the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe for a moment as a whole to something more terrestrial, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling a three-foot garden hose on one side of the canyon on the other side and watching the entire scene from a half-mile distance (as on the picture and on the next page).
From this distance, you can easily record a long, horizontal hose, but if you don't just suffer from clarity, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Because of your long distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given time, you will answer it with only one information: distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from half a mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we zoom in, we'll suddenly see a second dimension, in the shape of a circle that wraps a hose.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the hose length, but also in the "dimension in/against the movement of the watch handles", that is, around the circular section of the hose.
You're beginning to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle of the winding hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (recognizable. Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the broken string theory.
The unbreakable aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and twisted.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the coiling hose is short, "swift" and worse known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to explore the hose with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be large, extensive, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, folded and much worse visible.
Of course, in that case, we did not exactly anticipate the "swisted" dimension of the coiling hose thickness.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help yourself.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only discover the twisted dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he delivered with a stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of us known dimensions.
Kaluza’s radical claim was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be integrated into a single, unified concept structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluzo observation goes along with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he made clear and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oscar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and twisted dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the hose length, our universe has three dimensions that we are aware of at any moment.
But analogously with the circular circuit of the garden hose, the universe can also have additional dimensions, firmly folded into the space so insignificant that they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluzov's remarkable proposal, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly thick line of circles on the hose circuit.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin, one-dimensional line.
With a long view now, because of the drawing, we're going to reveal the twisted dimension even more easily, because we're going to see the motive in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, so it has a four-dimensional dimension.
It's hard to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little bit, note the illustrations on Figure 3; shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we zoom in on the geometry of the space just like we zoomed in on the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they are bent into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle represents a new, tiny and twisted dimension.
Just like strings of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - just for the sake of clarity we covered them only in the intersections of the square grid.
The background of Figure 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the common world around us - in such normal scales as the meters represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following pictures, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, when we follow the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - to the fourth level of the magnification in Figure 3 - we will see a new, suddenly shaped circle of a folded dimension, similar to the ropes or in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the extra circular dimension exists at every place in the direction of large dimensions in the same way as the hose circular circuit at each point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have covered the circular dimension only in some regularly placed points.
Figure 4 Kaluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of the space is summed up.
The resemblance to the hose is obvious, even though we record important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have only drawn two), whereas the hose has only one size.
What's even more important is that we're now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circled dimension is extremely small, to recognize it - as well as the circular circuit of the hose - is much harder than to observe apparent, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact reveal it beyond the strength of our most modern instruments to increase.
But most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a curved hump within normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three normal dimensions.
It is the dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-downs, left-to-rights and from the front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, except for the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we count time, then data five, in any case one more than we normally would expect.

The price for the e-book is 149- Kč.
To our surprise, then, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein's reasoning that the existence of additional twisted dimensions is not excluded if they are small enough.
The universe can still have more dimensions than we can see with just one eye.
How small should they be?
The most sophisticated technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billion meters.
We can hardly see a smaller twisted dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from the newly born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck's length, or size, far beyond the distinguishing capabilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzo-Klein theory.
Kohni Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: Part 5.
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-stroke harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Whoever's immersing in music theory will find its principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and puppeteer whose facebook profile can be monitored here, they have been living as a graphic since their graduation 20 years ago.
He's the guitarist of the band Wohti, which he's not supposed to be able to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like Brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohits.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of the 12," advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza do what you can with the twelve-point harmony on two strings and how it sounds.
If you pull out the third string, you can now flirt with the tune of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the change of alignment, Honza warns in the video.
Next time Honza comes back to the pentatonium and you try to put her together with the 12th.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you will read this in an interview with Jane Homola at the first lesson of his school games on electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, admits Castle Dvořák
We take the point and we're happy for it.
The first half had more chance of us, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored from a penance kick.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, were you?
I didn't know anything about it, even though on the second goal, where domestic fans are, it'd probably be worse.
You've cleared the pen half an hour, but you've also scored from the penultimate after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, it came out of the corner, and then it was a penalty.
You went up after her, and in the first half, you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the goal was scored, we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
It is also true, though, that at home they said something to their game about a break, perhaps they were not very satisfied with it.
You only scored for the first time on the field, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
Why is that so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We got off to a good start in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
Four games you've been waiting for a goal, didn't you have any fear that after the last match it might be similar?
I guess not, but of course we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal from the last game.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet for the big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
The lava flying to the surface of the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a mile away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now disturbs the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still emerges from the crack approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
As opposed to the previous eruptions of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
Scientists, however, fear that a lava tunnel could open up in places under the ice.
If that were the case, in addition to the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá and Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulphur, from the crack rises clouds of steam and gas.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with Fimmvörđuhals eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also much more gases," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
Since yesterday, however, the weather has improved considerably, with almost no wind in the morning.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange level (second highest) applies to Bárđarbunga and yellow (third) to Askju.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
It's passed by the wings.
Flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Valentine's Acrobat, who climbed from the cockpit to the ceiling of the top wing of the two-planet as well as between the wings, was introduced.
There it is only directed to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place on the fifth day, and the organizers again managed to prepare a few interesting airline pieces.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on wings" in the application of the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft plane 18.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant pull.
The acrobatic called Wingwalking has its origins in the United States.
After World War I, she tried to force many former war pilots.
But because of a large number of fatalities, he was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the airtime program.
Peggy comes out of the cockpit on the top wing after she starts.
He's performing various exercises there.
At the end of the performance it will move into the space between the wings of the aeroplane where its show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Czech Ultralight Club and the organizer of the airline day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main hub of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary racer landed on the surface with the Griffins of the Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so-called numbers).
Such a composition could be seen for the first time by aviation fans in the Czech Republic.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone breathtaking acrobatics with a 1945 plane.
He was made during the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He's been assigned to the military reserve.
Since 1963, he has been active in the civil sphere.
Even as a race plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Castle.
In the same place there is also another pearl of the Czech Air Day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no way to miss a powerful machine at the airport.
His polished aluminum coating radiated into the distance.
Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard was also admired in the colors of the French Air Force.
A small transport aircraft jumped for the denied Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Germany on an air day.
The German neighbours in Cheb presented themselves with reconstructed aircraft Like 18T or a three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borgy: Dramatic back in front of the camera!
Parental concerns were exchanged by Lucie Borgy for the work tonight at least.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
She was doing well in modern television news, as if she had never stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blondes ended up six weeks in which women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
However, Lucie will not regularly show up in TV Nova’s main news coverage.
The regular return awaits her according to information Blesk.cz up to a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borgy went back to the TV screen and it was a black shot.
An exhibition for a hand in Prague?
Hala would sell out, she's planning a Jag's bachelorette party
It would be dignified if something like this were to happen during the world championship.
But it depends on how the union stands up," in Jihlava, after an exhibition called the Golden Game, in which a wonderful Nagan team met again.
Even the players who participated in the gold hattrick.
Players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
Sure.
In short, it would be good to say good-bye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, during the tournament they can find one or two days when it is completely free and where such a match can be mixed.
We'll tell Gum (Jiri Šlégre) or Bedja Šcherban (the organizer of the Jihlava game) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So if I come in like this...
You don't want to play the team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow change your mind?
The representation and exhibition matches are two different things and the performances of the team are decisive.
One thing is, people like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially in the world championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed a bit.
How did you actually enjoy that Nagan meeting?
It's just that meeting with the players was great.
A man's made his stories come alive and he's had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
Of course, the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remind you of the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, and it's really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Rožička and Petr Čechmánek on the switch.
Can you remember your first game of representation?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we entered one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
Well, to dominate in some way, you can't say that.
In Jihlava, he caught Dominik Hasek for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (The Hague criticised Jag for reasons why he decided to end up in the team).
Even the Engineer showed up great.
You were with me once in the night to train, and there he was.
And now he's catching up in a famous way.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, football players begin their qualification.
On Monday morning, prominent guests flocked to the laughing NH Hotel.
People could see, like, the goalie Peter Čech from Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrba...
And there, that character in the black hat, that's Tomáš Rosicky!
Arsenal and the captain of the team arrived at a meeting about half past half past.
We have a beautiful fight against the Netherlands ahead of us.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he was already in the presentation in front of the press.
Programme of the Czech Representation
Monday September 1st: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Open training for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogrammiad (20:00)
Wednesday September 3rd Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of meeting
Rosicki and the community can support fans even before the centre match against the US (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday's training for them, which starts at 6:30 p.m. on Summer.
And it will be followed by an autographed one that will not be missed by Rosick or Czech.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which praises Coach Vrba, who has just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so long so far," praised Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The team's got three matches under Vrbo, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, she remixed 2:2 but lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
Only now.
The match with the Netherlands will launch a qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if the General against the U.S.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," said Willow.
The only player in the 30-member nomination who has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he couldn't get better in the middle of the US game, Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how she thought she was going to die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spine.
The charity CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is common among people with CMT because the disease is known very little.
In the United Kingdom, about 23,000 people are believed to suffer from CMT, which may be associated with motorized symptoms such as muscle weakness, immobile walking, and twisted toes.
People with disabilities may also experience insensitiveness or pain, which is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freydreich's Ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be chained to a wheelchair and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell down every day, and it took me a long time.
I've never been able to ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullied at school because of how I went and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 years old and was after several operations that were supposed to release her Achilles plums and flatten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her documentation, where she found out that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, and I panicked completely.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd be losing all my abilities.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have a disease, or you’d be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous."
After several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The charity CMT UK launched a month of information on CMT to alert the disease.
Businesses in the D.C.: Taxes are being raised with economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxes on companies in the country with accelerated economic recovery increased slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia together in the fiscal year 2013 took $27.6 billion to state and local cash registers, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - both state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and were the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation political group, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local wires by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue of the district, 56 %, is from the commercial tax, and 36 % of the income of Maryland is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows a relatively small tax revenue from business.
Researchers claim that the majority of tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of growth.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Last year, companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion on state and local real estate taxes, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax represents less than a fifth of corporate tax.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax represents almost half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland he owns many real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., a government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenue also appears to be increasing.
Companies in the region published a tax on corporate income of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland taxed companies' incomes on one billion dollars, mostly in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, local corporate tax burdens do not grow in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia there was an increase in taxation below the average, to 4,1 %.
Of all three districts (all of which have the same tax) Virginia has the lowest income tax of companies, 6 %.
The tax rate of companies in Maryland is 8,25 %, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will be reduced to 5% next year.
If the State continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of income taxation could be reduced to up to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study with small businesses in Washington, D.C., higher state and local taxes are being paid.
The commercial tax levied on small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for rising costs by increasing prices, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in trade tax are likely to continue next year, overall tax revenues from sales to both state and local governments will increase to 6,2 % compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be lagging behind others because the reduction of state expenditure is taking its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafat's scissors will be Europe's boss
Will a new state arise in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government forces have been clashing with the pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided by the West to the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, according to him, is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on Kyiv, so he cannot tell when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Any more sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic requires the right to disagree with part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is scheduled to propose a form of further approval of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, decided to hold the EU summit tonight.
Journalists were told by the permanent chairman of the Herman Van Rompuy meetings.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions are scheduled for Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union summit at the head of the European Council, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
He'll replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
In the lead of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton is replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed as a European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, just not talked about it
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with an exit from life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, that is not legal.
However, the comments made by the doctors referred to by LN show that such requests are being heard.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says a doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately three hundred people, 21 patients undergo experimental treatment with stem cells in the Prague Motole.
We don't know 100% if she'll be successful.
But if we don't, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motole neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript, they needed a war, says Huml about shooting down flight MH17.
Ambassador for the CzechSSD Stanislav Huml has a clear understanding of who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, "hard sanctions imposed on the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have been deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, the CIA's handwriting is also known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching, and the parties are again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless in the streets, parking for each family and the rope above Prague.
Before each election, it is repeated: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are exaggerating who prefers the electorate.
Lidovka.cz server has chosen unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovakians landed at Dunkerque.
A Leaning Cognition Begins
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovakian independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander, Alois Liška, has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and the dispatch to the front.
Finally, the British party met and included this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league in front of the Prague "S", Liberec declared Baník
Victoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which leads to a point in front of both Prague's "S".
The change in the front of the table was caused by the defeat of Slavie 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats in the home league, Sparta recovered, thanks to two Lafat attacks she defeated Jablonec.
The record win of the year was credited to Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.
62,000 spectators at the volleyball?
The Poles say yes.
The introduction of MS volleyball players in Warsaw brought a spectator record.
At the football stadium under the covered roof, there were 62 000 spectators watching a smooth homecoming win over Serbia.
Tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How do you survive coming back from vacation?
Take your time and sleep
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage at a normal working pace can be for many nuts.
He may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with a changed situation: not to rush and get a good sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: “We keep our fingers crossed”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, since she was brought to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter has today expressed her hope that an eighty-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her toes.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to a rescue service that said she had a cardiac arrest at the Yorkwill endoscopy in the Upper East Side, according to the source.
The doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
Reactions have not been allowed to wait long, including unreal support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted subtitles
That the media are twisting reality with their headlines, unfortunately, there is no news.
I know the headlines sell newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that many are so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been really worried about lately, more of a word of anger.
This applies in particular to the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
It is only in the text that you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the firing of rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared truce.
That's when the headline "Both sides broke the truce" comes out.
Does the journalistic community realize that this procedure is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even 60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shaw.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted "Jewish pig" and similar mistrust, it hit me.
Is this what the world wants to do to finish what Hitler didn't do?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews they were destined to destroy the Slav?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You're often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would eliminate and wipe the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize another fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, almost 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go among their own, like Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel they have work, social security and top-notch health care (I have seen for myself how to go to the top-notch private hospital of Hadassa, which is funded by the sponsorship gifts of Jews from around the world, Arabs usually go and are treated there of course).
Hamas also attacks their Arab brothers with their arrows.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus this troubled area, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, though indirectly in the headlines.
Inform Hamas' practices, his abuse of humans as human shields.
Please inform Hamas of his goal to eliminate the state of Israel at all costs.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform Hamas that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform us that in nine years of government in Gaza, this area could be flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, but for which Gaza’s administrators do not pay and even get angry, the currents are sometimes cut off.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate Israel’s territory, but, for example, in the construction of homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed Monday morning's statement: The Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars).
The announcement triggered a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch Google seemed to sell for one billion sure, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, who only three years ago founded Justin.tv, was set up to become a commonly used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online feeds from games - in the words Business Insider “YouTube for Lively Transferred Playing”.
Interfacing Twitch.
On YouTube are already popular videos of “Let's play”, a kind where wisers (mostly older) give the game of processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact of the matter is that YouTube, when it comes to describing Twitche, comes a lot, so the news that YouTube buys Twitch, they didn't upset anyone very much, was a textbook example of how the established company will pay off possible competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is a statement by CEO Twitche Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim that sport rather does than watch, it is difficult to understand what is so amazing about playing instead of real playing just to observe.
One thing is to watch at three in the morning a friend over his shoulder playing Resident Evil, and the whole other thing is to watch someone stranger get 20 hits on his head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, the most popular games are from the perspective of players, so looking at their record, without you being able to control your perspective, is a pretty good recipe for getting headaches.
I accept that games like speed run, in which Rogers Bannisters our electronic time finishes the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably won't be very interesting.
But what do they know about this skepticism like me?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth on top of Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is interfering with Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it used to be swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the director of Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, “he believes in the future of games” and the media does not seem to be afraid, nor is it swallowing - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist blogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
The original video has been attached.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us: Whom will you trust?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
It's as if human research was completely useless compared to the authority they imagine they have.
Only when they say "man", they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to the myths of God written by men.
If there really is intelligent with a creator for some purpose, it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be him who added a series of further evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, plot stories.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be God's word.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as being written by humans, not Gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or maybe they listened to an angel's dictatorship, but those texts were not written by anyone but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire universe.
If a creature of that size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy letter.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the mere human authors could not measure up to such a work.
And people wouldn't have to believe it blindly because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and it would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
She would continue to inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion that leads to ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origins, and all are constantly falling apart on increasingly separate denominations, seeking contentious truths, and each in some way claims God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing spread and separation in each direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, the Bahá'u'llah Kitab-i-Akdas, the Zarathustraves Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharats Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormons, or the Book of Urantia are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god" and the members of the believers each say that the rest are on the way.
The only logical explanation is that everyone is on the road to a certain extent.
None of the above-mentioned books have any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence support and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apology (defensions), because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So you can't say they're proof of divine wisdom.
Many of these have been promoted by gross atrocities instead of morals, and many have been claimed to have been confirmed by fulfillment of prophecies - with the fact that each can also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are thus subject to interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, rather a mutual comment.
We have to point out once again that we have two different authors here whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's definitely not telling an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the "Moses" and Moses do not attribute the authorship of any of them, since almost certainly it did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as her believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet they are centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by doctrinals and ethos and their entirely different perspectives on Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups as Luciferians were spread and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these adjustments applies to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young religions of Moses, the authors of the New Law decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord of the Mountain" changed "Lord of the Flies" to "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently amended for both religious and political reasons.
The rest of what happened by the New Testament was canonized in the fourth century C.E. in a series of committee decisions at the House in Nicaragua.
The four Gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by a simple show of hands, as if some things were allowed to be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the narrowness of the original church.
So the Council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also conscientiously received more than ten books from the Bible, even though they had reference to books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items we will find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human writers.
But how could it be so approved if God were the true author of this random mixture of novels, parables, and psalmic lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by much enlightenment, rather, by the contrary!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, no matter what it is from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believe in spells, bloody victims, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and five magical elements.
They thought using a magic rod to spray blood on someone would cure him of leper.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and drinking is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they'd give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from a pen of a truly superior being and was designed as a literal history, then it would not contain any of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigotry savages who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, abduction, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists keep ignoring all of this.
Some of their website admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their favorite books, they wouldn't even have God.
In their world, the same is true.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "the worship of creation instead of a creator".
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and God itself and even insist that the depravation of their supposedly "sacred" books somehow perverts God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible could at the same time be wrong because it cannot separate the doctrine from God.
So it's a form of prayer where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were the very God, because they think they're the word of God.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, constructed, grouped, translated, interpreted, adjusted and often deliberately altered and twisted by mere missing people.

A member of the bucket challenge slipped her jaw
When she poured ice water on her head, she screamed at Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom by damaging her facial structure.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed at the bucket call by slipping her jaw.
While she was pouring ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged the bone structure in her face.
"The water was so cold that I had to scream, but my jaw began to tighten," she told The Mirror.

An attacker at a Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died.
A man named Chechnya, according to the New China Agency, forced a forced entry into the primary school building this morning and attacked about half an 11th local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chechnya later killed himself with a leap from the height, said New China with a reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many couples have only one progeny in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the freshmen in Láné how he had to sit in school
The smallest schoolchildren were taken by the Niners to their class, where the teacher and I waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, and fortunately, you are no longer free people," Zeman said to the children.

School management called him at a hockey game in Lithuania a while ago.
"They were first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started his school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.

Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, naked celebrity pictures made public
Screenshot of the screen with the output of the unique files
So far an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com pointed out.
They allegedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users recorded them through automatic backup of iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't said anything about the problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects images as falsified, but several of the images concerned have already admitted.
Among them is actress Jennifer Lawrence, famous for her title role as Katniss in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use acquired images and videos to enrich.
American magazines reportedly showed interest in the footage, according to 4chan server reports, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely really a weakness in iCloud security.
On GitHub two days ago, a tool appeared that allowed you to get passwords to user accounts through gross force, i.e. automatic repetition of attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool worked well, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the publication of this instrument.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of naked pictures of celebrities to be considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, guaranteed many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, it is a deposit of sensitive photos in an unprotected form of unnecessary risk.
If you want to backup explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt files before upload.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will have the opportunity to move the sensitive images to "safe" in time, and you will have the space to delete the unauthorized images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy the space in the online repository.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communications on the Internet to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altair Valášk in PDF format.
Smart way to save for a college script
Since the price for the university script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the new student of the second year came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system for borrowing books from classmates from senior years offering nominal compensation to delay their resale.
“A book on calculations, which usually costs $180, I won for ten semesters and chicken nuggets, ” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He's lost 120.
According to the University Council, he spends an average student on textbooks and aids over $1,200 a year, but students have different options for how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is borrowing textbooks, which allows students to use a semester book often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookshops in campuses, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the department shows that about a quarter of the books in the university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased according to the National Association of University Shops in University Bookstores.
There are 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 at Chegg.com, a retailer who specializes in textbooks.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the comments of other people or the wear and tear, the teaching texts are a suitable option.
On Chegg.com, Calculus is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid for the used print “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new one was sold for 48 bucks.
University Educator Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students in their teachers should check that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Borrowing
Also worth considering is borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for a new book.
For example, a student could borrow Calculus for about $20 a semester.
Get acquainted with the terms of the trade in which you borrow a book, including the penalty for notes, highlighting or weariness and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get a normal e-book instead.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic licence valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows Calculus for six months for about $61.
According to the Braceys, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, since many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who's going to Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends that you follow ISBN because it guarantees you're buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it's really in stock, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Bahno, the mud itself.
And then they found guns in the well in the torso of a gun from the end of the war.
That well is standing just outside the church of St. George.
We discovered the growth around us and we started pulling out the summer spread - about a metre and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the firbed bottom, we hit the head," Radomil Novák looked like.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found that it was a thorzo attack German rifle used by SS units.
It's supposed to be unusual to find them.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Novak.
All the wooden construction things have decayed over time, so it's useless.
Her body, of course, is preserved - holding its shape.
How did it get in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dumping weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the Ghost Jessens found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around here once, so we slowed the excavations, we carefully swallowed the mud so that there would be no misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The find will end at the museum's depository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech Republic
An exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "Sorry, I have to take this... call me from Donetsk," he apologized about eight times during an exclusive interview with Currently.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the local Centre for the Liberation of Prisoners of War.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At each such interruption, it was not possible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or places where they were - or should be - that Ruban specified with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"This will be it - go there," ended one of the lightning discussions with Doneck and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is an advance general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
He was in Donetsk yesterday - when we arranged the interview.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-two hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their count to 30.
There can be many more of them, of course.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not yet Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we could run into your captured countryman and free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers will take them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian flags of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy, as will any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Doña separatists - and therefore Czechs - among them, for example, they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's gonna make it.
The Ukrainian side acts like a state in the war as well.
A.cz: And how long have you managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it's long gone by over a hundred men.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... we didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue fighting.
There are doctors in the war, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's it.
And every day there are more and more.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners and just a human request.
A.cz: It is reported that in a few months you gained great authority and even confidence in the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both warring parties?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev named me "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't offend me.
And that may even determine the nature of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers ’ Congregation, I had obtained some authority earlier.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is a Ukrainian government, or a Donetsk or Luhansk government, it is very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I just tell them that they torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I'm being taken prisoner... this job can always mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
... (long silence) ... Ukrainians and separatists turn away from the torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm afraid so.
And the executions?
They're only happening on the Donetsk side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners, I have no information.
Not even an indication that the Ukrainian army is allowing anything like this.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't say the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characteristics and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be independent and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their unrelenting opponents - to life and death.
As we say, they ate them all the way down the throat.
The same dreams and complaints were also made manifest in Maidan.
And now I'm going to speculate a little bit: Russia is supporting separatists and the West is supporting the Ukrainian state.
I think one speculation is big and the other one small.
This sentence of mine, yet it hides in itself an unrelenting contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you find one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war line, I'm unarmed and I show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical meter.
Those faces of people pointing at me, I can always see well... and they can always pull the trigger of their guns.
The pilot, the experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it's just like a little governory in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, they keep talking about it, and Ukraine considers it to be some kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an unrelenting enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - on the Ukrainian television discussion show, you called your Prime Minister Arsenija Jaceňuk weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do the best if he left quickly.
I get at least five times the fear for those three hundred meters of walking.
Why, then, should I hide from the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and is harmful to our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a stake in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jaceňuk "the queen".
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which fear or authority would come.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to give him a position... he has to drive the country, manage it, and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, rest on a paid emotion.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Jacenuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just always complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save the Markets
The underexpenditures of 3 Sylvester Stallone have returned from the $90 million budget in the United States less than $30 million and Sin City: A woman for whom I would kill only $12 million from the 70 million budget.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also films for children such as how to train dragon 2 were a disappointment for cinemas.
According to an article in Robbie Collin's film review in Telegraph, the quality of children's films is their fault.
Collin marked 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films and how to train dragon 2 he called just a "functional" sequel.
When it comes to movies that are set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily need to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, he compared Entertainment Weekly's CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer movie premieres broadcast at least 2,000 cinemas between the War Victims' Day and July 20th 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in audience access and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book processing, said to Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing. ”
We have to accept this and not try to pursue what's already happened.
Unlike the current crisis of the Hollywood cashiers, Netflix's profits have reached $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studies for relying too much on comic books rights, and predicted Hollywood’s “dismemberment. ”
In the light of the current decline, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic fortune - teller.
With possible major cashiers in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimonů and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter said: "Next summer will be the biggest cashiers in history and no one will worry about selling."
KLDR again threatens Seoul, launches another short-fly rocket
North Korea launched another short-fly rocket into the sea, reported Soul.
The alleged missile test was carried out shortly after the end of the United States and South Korea's joint military maneuvers, which Pchjongjang sees as preparations for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the northwest of KDLR along the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defence, according to the DPA, said that the shots were fired from a place in the northwest of KLDR and flew about 200 kilometres away.
North Korea apparently launched the first rocket out of Chagang Province, said the South Korean media with a reference to military circles.
In the province there is an underground launching ramp for Scud rockets.
It is another of a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea carried out an unusually large number of rocket tests and artillery this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests against the NATO summit in Newport took place.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in the NATO campaign.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from Blue Mountains
TWO young tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16 - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old man set out for a tour of Govets Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the concerned relatives called the police around eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party was sent out, including local police and rescue team, and a couple were found around 11:00 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In a stable condition, the ambulance was taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc only brought in a point from Opava, he had a win on his leg Vyíček
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could have made the decision, but failed in two of his biggest chances.
After the goal called mainly the shot close to the end three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on Opava goalkeeper Joseph Kvetonj.
I've had it on my feet, I've got to give it a chance.
I'm angry with myself," he put your little lady's ashes on his head.
"Maybe I should've put it up in the air, I got a little sick," he said.
Sigmy's defense did not allow Opave much, but Mikul's 11-minute raid was an exception, but it was covered by the Reichl goalie.
Then the Hanaks began to push, but in the bloc they did not release them, and the shots from the distance caught Kveton.
Fifteen minutes compared, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more out of the game and Opava threatened us only with standard situations.
But he did not change your chance, and so it ended 0-0," lamented Hanak coach Leoš Kalvod.
Opava dot also took due to absences in the assembly, where, apart from the two wounded, Peter Vavřík with three-point shooter Peter Ševčík, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike their previous policies, it did not allow them to take the lead.
The deputies deserve discharge.
Sigma acted more football, but we did not let her do anything for one standard," said Slezany coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma's been tied to four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Joseph Lébra, who, after defeating Znojm, conditioned his millionth deposit into the treasury in a diametrically different performance in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr Lébra's warning, so there can be no talk of boys not wanting to fight," Kalvod noted, and added to the address of the sleeping shooter Váíček: "I believe it will come and will score, so it will start to fall there.
But after the first shot I'm going to change it right away to save my goals for the next game," he laughed at Calvoda.
Al Pacino's exhaled the Venice twice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a tremendous enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñarrit was among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days showed the impression that interest in the 71st annual festival in Venice had dropped somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics recognized, but for viewers less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, there were only empty seats left in the cinemas.
The heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet outside the festival palace has not yet been surrounded by such crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute seat in the hotel.
The crisis is discussed in Italy more than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has also struck respected institutions like Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not characterized by a lack of personality, but only in the context of films.
While younger fans yearned for the autographs of comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully hosted dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event was the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacin.
He's glowing right now in two movies.
In the story of the “Exception Beyond the Competition ” by Oscar Barry Levison according to Philip Roth’s novel, Pacino, a 40 - year - old, has a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the second day as a strange owner of the country's rural town of Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green filmed, was a truly memorable experience.
Volpi's cup for best acting performance shouldn't miss it - but does Pacino's artist still have the price format?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, especially the Italian one, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the land from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
After all, it is the Italian film that is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman rewarded with long applause.
The Calabrian mafia's legacy is viewed in it as a view of family relations between clans fighting for power and money, and the director managed to reconcile all the assumptions for a good movie: quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also took part in the chamber psychothriller Hunger Heart, which filmed Saverio Costanza with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who would almost destroy her own child with her pathetic anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not receive a warm reception of either the Redemption for glory, or the 3 hearts, both of the works sung on the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, the Birdman and the Black Souls, aren't so little at the first half of the festival.
And even though the festival pictures have all sorts of depressing themes, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of the American cheerleading 40s, she was able to cheer up for more than one day.
Police officers caught four pervitine manufacturers in Prague, medicines vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained three men in the past days 42, 42 and 37 years of age and a woman of five who, from last November to this August, produced and sold drugs of pervitine in Prague 9," police spokesman Jan Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, an intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the prior consent of the state attorney of another member of the group, a man of seven and a half years.
The last of the four officers was caught in the mid-morning hours of August 20th at the small incinerator," the speaker said.
A woman received a third of the drugs for the transport of drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a broad field of action.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konjevo Street and at other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitin, supplied various tools and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He then weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitine.
He was assisted by a woman of five and a half years of age who had not yet been punished with drug trafficking from Poland or by the sale of drugs to drug addicts.
For this she received from the organizer a reward in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
Criminalists also carried out several home visits on the basis of a judge’s order, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and items which, according to expertism, could be considered as complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, then the police found that the main organiser had been sentenced seven times since 1995 for property crime, the woman was not prosecuted," the police spokesman added.
The latter was sentenced to sexual abuse in 2006 and a seven-year-old auto mechanic, who has been prosecuted in prison, has been prosecuted nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, which are threatened by up to ten years in prison.
In the three persons, the investigator finally submitted an appeal to the state representative for a motion to dismiss the link, where the judge eventually placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth defendant, a seven-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case were not as crucial as the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at a very "interesting" price.
As a good example, in Italy handmade chess with a playing board of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like, prepare more than 40 000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red-painted figurines stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibres.
Probably no one's surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a climbing hobby available.
If you don't have chess as a valuable enough gift, you also have the Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course manually) at 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Disrupting high school and high school doesn't make any sense.
Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics also show that high school students have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
It's mostly routine stuff, like taking flowers from the summer storage back to the classrooms and siphoning their wings.
They're going to have a little more fromola at the Mountain High School.
A few days before the beginning of the season, they look for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, four-year high school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not in public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They must have waited for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering into the register of schools managed by MŠMT.
"French Socialists should shut up and put France in order," says a key ally of Francoise Hollanda.
Valls calls on a heavily fragmented left to "show her support" to a combat-oriented socialist president whose new division of functions has not been met with the consent of most Frenchmen.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said and gathered his applause.
As a humble gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the passionate assumptions of Emmanuel Macron, the new Finance Minister, who proposed at the beginning of the week to release the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain “consistent ” with the government.
Christian Taubir, Minister of Justice, made him a budget line when she appeared at a meeting of the rebel Socialist MPs, where the Socialist Party criticised her for "The French have lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the Socialists when she declared that she did not assume that the new Walls government would last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Walls too. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Penová told her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call to dissolve Parliament and declared that it was convinced that it could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in March's municipal elections and in May extremely conservative rights succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey of the weekly Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing itself into several competing factions before the end of the Dutch term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that change is taking place in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limit Prague to election
The amendments to the relevant declarations should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
From the streets of Prague, there will be no more casinos before the municipal elections, and the city will not limit street art.
There's not even gonna be a dog out there.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in October.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends in a few weeks' time of mandate," said Councilman Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
Over the past few weeks, several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish the wholesale gambling in their territory.
The gambling bill won't change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.
We would not be able to do so now even technically, given, for example, the deadlines for comments and so forth," explained Manhart.
He added that the last negotiations of the current representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the decree, would take place on 11 September.
A referendum on a flat ban on gambling is being held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
The ban on gambling currently applies, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The statement will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called busing.
In particular, Prague 1 is complaining about this, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal for places that she would like to extend the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
The statement regulating the outing of dogs the city is planning for several months, not yet completed.
The location of herens and the issue of busing resolves city statements.
They can only be issued or edited by the representative of the capital.
Councillors have only an advisory vote, they can't issue their own statements.
Last week, he put the winners of the Scottish independence protagonists at arm's length.
The campaign for Scotland's independence was in danger of making this mistake the third time she almost put on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you won't get to the heart of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morals of the New Testament are still alive in Scotland, even though few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to drive the money changers out of the temple than to have them dictate how they should vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmon knows this well, and so in the television debate he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect the "superior will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters vote for independence, and start supporting a single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimas.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about what kind of currency Scotland will have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, working opportunities and defence of public health, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers in the matter of currency and also made the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
As Hammond said, "he got into bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to the voters in Scotland, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of the British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmonde was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee at home.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: The Scots are not supposed to jump out and have to accept what it is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Miloš Urban

Milos Urban Longest Year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that hasn't gone anywhere, and we just laid down and made out with Grandma's summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when you could get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Rapid Arrow, already taken care of, whistling on a bicycle around the Imperial to the rear behind Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, the sun was no longer warm, the backs and shoulders were smoothing, the beams fell on farewell.
The evening of mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep till 6:30, a week later, the moment before bedtime will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then rise at 7:30 in the morning.
Monday's coming.
It doesn't usually rain, on the contrary, the summer is squirming in front of the school.
Join in a ghostly light on the cry and feel like a plastic figure in a glass weight, there's the school, ZDŠ A.
A Zavotsky with a holly pink collar, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, guys pulled up, girls breastsier.
They're bastards out there, avoiding them, and it's still interesting how they're holding together and how soon they're here.
And these adult-looking girls who come in screaming, they're laughing at something hysterically, and maybe something's changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything's back to normal with me.
And again, the new freshmen, some nervous and other delights, why are they coming here at all?
Because he has to, an educational war compulsory.
So inside, the cool humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately, is still the same as borrowing the student keys from the tin box, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress stays in memory, now it doesn't, it's pretty windy, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
It's just that the stomach's opening up and the head's starting to ache.
A head that will understand even worse the teaching of mathematics, the devil's game for the chosen, among which I am not and will never be.
Once again, the threes and fours, not the fives, hide from the test, fall into the bench, and best subdued, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream of stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and undermines no one's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now like years ago.
She let her own daughters die.
She's in danger of a special punishment - News.cz
The first delivery took place in March 2012 in the public toilet booth at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, she was born with a little girl who, after she had cut the umbilical cord, packed it in a ready blanket, hid it under her jacket, and took it to a road trailer, where she put it in bushes a few dozen metres from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school.
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I needed to go to the bathroom. That's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors I wore to school," the defendant described and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to her place, put the child's body in her backpack and took it away, removed the body from her backpack, packed it in a black plastic bag, and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkov Brod," she said in a complaint that it was not entirely obvious when the newborn died.
It could have been tens of minutes, but it could have been several hours after birth, asphyxiation when covered with blankets or when inserted under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unstuck umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, in the near future from February to April 12, when the child’s corpse was found by chance under a bushes near the pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, gave birth secretly again.
This time in the bathroom of the loft in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive without cutting and tying the umbilical cord around her neck, she put the child in several plastic bags, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he was taken along with his partner to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave it to her.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant's, but apparently he didn't know about his partner's pregnancy.
Even so, he is not standing before the courts now, only being punished for his sin against the Funeral Law.
It was also him who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated a child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was wrong, but it came to me at that moment as a human," she did not hide the resentment of the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to and feared the man in the relationship.
During her statement, the young woman spoke quite in balance.
Tears were in her eyes only the moment she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She didn't want to kill
"They follow me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't make an allowance because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I always wanted to put him in a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain it to you," the judge answered.
However, she refused to act with the mind and intent of the newborn to kill.
The second child, according to her claim, was also born dead.
Even when she was pregnant, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've restricted it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I even restricted smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed to all and to repeated questions that she was having health problems, that she was being immersed.
And so is my friend.
The main review will continue at the castle court on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
A judgment could already be handed down on Wednesday.
The woman is at risk of being sentenced to up to 18 years in prison, or even a special sentence.

Pro-Democratic Activists in Hong Kong the day after the decision to vote provoke the Chinese authorities
There was a group of loyal people near Beijing who were waving a Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved the election in 2017 in Hong Kong to be attended by only two of the three candidates.
All candidates must first receive support from the nominee commission, which is likely to be made up of members of the faithful Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial centre to protest the "Occupation of the Centre" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will expand to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on China's official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on the elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference to be held by Prime Minister Li is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also to be held by the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong Affairs Office and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists have announced that they will meet in the afternoon in front of the Hong Kong government office.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start talks with eastern Ukraine on "national sovereignty"
According to a description of the events, Russian newspapers asked Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday to stop the Ukrainian government from fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on "national sovereignty" of the torn areas.
His spokesman, Dmitrij Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of implying that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated in order for the Russian-speaking region to have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to deal with the pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to a clear strategy that follows the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists take over the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novo Russia actual independence so that the place with the West can be connected with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of State television Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to regain the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were ruled by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and Separatists of the recently occupied territory were referred to as “Novoruska” or “New Russia”, a term referring to the famous pre-revolution days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that everyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign ahead of the October 26th parliamentary elections, while government units attack civilians in the areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we need to start meaningful negotiations without delay, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been dealt with by Kiev for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas of the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern region.
It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the spokesman for the Kremlin, which was supposed to correct the “wrong interpretation” of Putin's notes, highlighted Russia's approach to solving the uprising of separatists in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million population of origin belong to the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should be much more difficult to annex to both Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and the public opinion polls that took place prior to the conflict have shown widespread support for the continuation of Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and thus essentially give the Kremlin effective control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime commercial background and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the centre down, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inauguration speech of 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kyiv to act as separatists followed the next insurgent procedure last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously quiet area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists strengthened the Russians took control of Novoazovska by such a force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a drag to occupy strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has accelerated the enormous civilian and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovska and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Pošenko took part in a meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilova after last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units entered the Donetsk region to support the siege of separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers to be captured in Ilovaj during the Russian invasion was exchanged Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured a week ago in Ukraine's interior, Lysenko said.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greeko are also involved in the scandal with exposed photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with hackers, who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greeko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrities got on the Internet series of explicit naked pictures by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko were also reportedly made public because of their escape from iCloud.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed last month, said to Confidite magazine: “It’s disgusting. ”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and extended to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, reports online that the hack is “unashamed” and those who have become its target “beseem to be humiliated”.
It's believed that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer and his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of him getting knocked up without breaking up by the pool.
For example, Palmer was active in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: “This is a clear violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen of the hacker on his Twitter criticized: “Publicing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods. ”
Legally, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy football players made up for Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings, which the co-owner of the Olomoucian Sigmy Josef Lebr sent to his subordinates last week, seem to be the past.
Although Opava was eventually brought only a point behind the brandless draw.
After all, the club's boss's establishment and fighting were just a little comfortable.
The payoff money could come to the club soon.
"I will have another match, as I said last week, but I am already far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed that despite Sigma's failure, his players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and the deployment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," he thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial domestic pressure, then the game settled and in the second half it was better.
After the victory, Calvod’s commissioners reached out, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our imaginations.
We lacked only one chance to be completely satisfied," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of football players was caused only by his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
On my side, on the coach's side, or on the fans' side," said Lébr.
The pressure must be calculated by Sigma
The players didn't want to comment too much after the game in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to accept it," young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Totally without comment then left a question to Lébrov's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vácíček, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in the Saturday match.
After that, however, he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to come after us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and drive everyone's ass, it will work," he said.
They Take Warnings to Heart
Nor did the coach Leoš Kalvoda cover up that preparing for the match was not the easiest in view of the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was clear that Mr. Lebra's warning had been taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about them not fighting and pulling it off," the Olomouc coach said.
It was just like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a long time to deal with the toughness and realize what the other league was about.
It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
There's nothing left to hope that Sigma's going to work in the next game.
"I'd like to believe so much," he added.
