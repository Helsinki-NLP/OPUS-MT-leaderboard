Don't forget Tom's blind.
Mary seemed to be getting married.
There's no dysputation against the taste.
When Tom came home tonight, he found out there was no dinner left for him.
He knows them.
I'm sure they're too proud of their daughter.
Tom turned right and Mary went the other way.
One left.
He started explaining what had happened.
Tom's got a cast iron stomach, he can eat almost anything.
Mother didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows the wine.
Tom felt someone knock on his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words can express how amazing you are.
I'd like some fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The maple font invented by Sumer was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I like summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course I am!
Mary loves you.
What can I get you?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before she ate.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left the high-pitched on the table.
He's not above a glass of beer after a full day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm still happy with my work.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot of money for it.
Clearly Tom's lying.
Straight ahead and then right and then right?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he wants to win.
Tom's gonna be 13 tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with balance.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember how she was?
My belt's too tight.
Playing bass is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer at our place.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out today.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm just here to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a costume party from the 17th century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He climbed a tree with great effort.
To translate Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought it to my attention.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We were complaining about noise managers in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for the job.
They're falling apart.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen on you?
They're not helping.
I like the tie.
We didn't do as well as we'd like.
Please close the door on the way out.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joanna have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were college girls.
The sky is covered in black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom's got a enema.
What am I supposed to do in this situation?
Do you take a train to school?
Tom's not going to school tonight.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom gonna visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me over for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised when that happens.
He's free.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom carefully washed his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy when she got the record deal.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this charmastic if you could help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out there.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sang in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.
I told Tom he was a fake friend, and he took offense.

This bridge used to be a charge bridge.
He was waving at her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We got shot on the lawn by the river.
Tom's never had a hard drink.
Tom doesn't like working.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary Tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-painted walls.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Did any of you talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence's freshly cut.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're getting fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written in accordance with instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There were absolutely no doubts.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laugh attack.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding was last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's barking.
I lent Tom a ridge.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not that stick anymore.

If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go on tour.
Try talking to the police.

I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.

He asked me to wait there until he got back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to do it.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle this on our own?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Put it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's quiet.
Tom didn't want Mary to lose.
Tom's home.
Throw that balloon to Tom.
I insult her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better person.
You're stealing, aren't you?
Tom has to comb his hair.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste's backed up again.

Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.

Easy to buy, easy to get rid of.

According to the Tatoeby Directives, members are encouraged to add sentences in their native language or to translate them from a language they understand into their native language.
