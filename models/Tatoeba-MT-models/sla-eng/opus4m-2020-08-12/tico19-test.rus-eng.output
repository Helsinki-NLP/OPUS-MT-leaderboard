How long have these symptoms been present?
and all chest pains should be treated this way, especially given your age
and with high temperature
and also need to check your cholesterol and arterial pressure levels

Do you have other patients with the same symptoms at home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you experiencing a break now?
Are you still suffering from chest pain?
Because it's flu season.
But we also should not be overlooked because of the pain in the chest, which is of a cardiological nature
But the more important problem right now is the chest pain.
But I'm having trouble breathing.
But I know a lot of people cough at me.
But we have to treat any pain in the chest with the utmost severity
But you're breathing well now, aren't you?
Because I don't remember that pain in my chest anymore.
Does it look like someone's squeezing your chest?

I'll send you an image
I'm having some chest pain today.
I've got a little headache and a fever today.
I think it's the flu.
I think it's the flu in easy form.
Does that remind you that it's like a very, very heavy person sitting on your neck?
It all started almost simultaneously with headache and fever.
I'm in pain in the center of my chest.
It's like the pain in the chest.
It's in my chest.
It's right in the middle of my chest.
It's in the center of the chest.

From time to time, I feel a little chest pain.
Okay, do you have any other symptoms besides pain?
Or is someone sitting on your chest?
exactly the same high temperature and cough, headache and muscle pain
pain right in the middle of my chest
Show me in this picture where you feel pain
Because you have a high temperature.
So you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?

You know, I have diabetes and all that.
You said you were having this pain in your chest.
The rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) is similar in the countries of the European Union/Economic Zone and Britain, thus confirming that despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive treatment units, it is necessary to increase the level of preparedness for the inflow of patients with COPID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Uhan Province of China, Hubey.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronary virus, now known as the heavy acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the source of infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 suffer from mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients recovering.
In approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 develops in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization, while in the remaining 6 per cent adopts a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/Economic Zone (EEA) country and in Britain and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We are also comparing the current number of cases of COPID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and in Britain with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COPID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and in the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the same way as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe that met the criteria on which WHO determines the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of whom returned from Uhan Province of China, Hubay.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 has been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and Britain, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 with fatal outcome, account for Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the distribution of COVID-19 to the EU/EEA and Britain and their comparison with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 has been calculated for the limited cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Britain
The trends in the 14-day COVID-19 cumulative disease in EU/EEA countries and in Britain in general were consistent with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Britain as a whole began to grow around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020, there was a sharp leap (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of registered cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain similar trends were observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COPID-19 disease in EU/EEA countries and in Britain as compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and Britain.
The observed trends in COVID-19 cumulative morbidity suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different patient selection rules for the analysis of the presence of COVID-19, including “overtaking” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive therapy and the media noted that hospitals and intensive treatment offices in these regions were already as full as possible.
For the time being, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases (not reported) are available in the EU/EEA intensive care unit for patients with COPID-19.
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement current monitoring data on the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to the 2010-2011 study, there is a significant difference in the number of cots in intensive treatment and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
In the sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of the COVID-19 risk express assessment, scenarios for the modelling of the loading of health systems ' resources with estimates for the hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Britain are presented where the risk of shortages of available beds in intensive treatment units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive therapy offices tend to serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive treatment units is recommended to be provided at the 2nd level of the Territorial Units Nomenclature for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive treatment offices should be prepared for a long-standing SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive therapy, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the most recent ECDC report on the results of the risk assessment, the rapid, proactive and integrated approach to curbing the proliferation of SARS-COV-2 is essential, with a subsequent shift from deterrence to minimization, since given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may not have enough time to consider, adopt and adjust their response if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the express risk assessment also lists public health measures designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a small period of time during which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries, an influx of patients will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronary infection in 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a major acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article proposes an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving subject matter of research.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, forecasting for the continuation and prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many questions are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The celebration of the spring (Chinese New Year), which took place on January 25, 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home for the entire holiday and many weeks after.
Given the high level of similarity with the Coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the SARS-CoV-2 virus on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease coronary infection on 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been detected, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “enemy number one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on his virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have appeared in less than two months, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to synthesize research results in a new and rapidly developing substantive area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus - the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the currently known facts of prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other equally urgent issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been classified as non-lethal pathogens and mainly cause about 15% of the total respiratory disease 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered high-pathogenic human coronarys, i.e. a major acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and a respiratory coronary (MERS-CoV) that caused the outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, reports of pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first submitted to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatality was recorded in Ukhahn.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that medical workers had been infected, allowing for the transmission of the virus from a human being.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhan, and urban public transport was discontinued.
On 24 January, it was observed from the first clinical study of this disease that 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the marine product market in Uhan, which was considered a starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronary virus was a global public health emergency.
By the time this report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had already penetrated about 50 other countries around the world (Figure (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and extent of the risk of an outbreak still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COPID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1/HA2bhdA).
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but were mainly infected by people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, few were under 20, and only 14 had not yet reached the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in the province of Hubei and in the surrounding regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days have elapsed since the onset of COPID-19 symptoms prior to diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the time of symptoms to the occurrence of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who had coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large cover viruses containing one strand of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS contagion, the glycoproteins of the lumbar hipods (S) are associated with cell receptors of the 2nd type angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the viral RNA gene; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with cloudy glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which are then merged with the membrane cell released by the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It is established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with a 99.98 per cent genome that coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease in the Juanan marine product market in Uhan.
Genetically SARS-COV-2 is closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
By means of an enlightening electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-tonic cuts of the human respiratory epithelial.
It has been established that the human ACE2 enzyme is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is less associated with ACE2 enzyme than in SARS-CoV, which explains that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an unknown short-lived protein coded orf3b and a secretive protein coded orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play some role in the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-dimensional ACE2 enzyme, with permission from 2.9 Å in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which was evidence of the diagnosis and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for conducting a drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to humans through live animals and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that SARS-CoV-2’s first hosts were bats, since the new 96 % virus was identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely, SL-COVZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate host the virus has become, which has managed to overcome the strain barrier and infect the human being; the route of transmission has yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that snakes had become vectors of the virus from flying mice to humans, which had resulted in homologous recombination in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou assumed that the pangolines were long-term mammals who fed ants and were often used in traditional Chinese medicine — potentially intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption was based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between the two genomes is still very high, and it is therefore considered that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in the dry environment and for up to 5 days at below 20 °C and 40-50 per cent humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating for up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peruxic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorohexidine.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Usually, the host virus will first recognize the inborn immune system by means of receptor-recognizable receptors (ORRs), including C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus induces inflammation, maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophages phagocytosis against viral antigens.
However, thanks to N-white SARS-CoV, immune reactions may be avoided.
Adaptive immune responses are soon included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the production of B cell specific antibody virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies removed from the recovery patient were neutralized by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system entails local education of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case lead to polyorganismal insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by cluster exposure, is more likely to affect older people with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of the first 425 infections in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly from 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a difference of 0 to 24 days.
The later study, based on demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease without a symptom.
The general practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contacts with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which may be the only symptom or other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, frown, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and rhinitis.
Some patients experienced respiratory and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or respiratory disease symptoms and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis even if there are no pathology in the chest.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98 per cent high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial light ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of domestic infection and transmission of the virus from the unsymptomable infected.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing (55%).
However, 80 per cent of these required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which was much higher than in patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher mortality rate than in COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), breathing (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation required 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed deaths.
According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was set at 6.47 at 95% CI between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than the last two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clusters often occur when infected within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or combined on a transport such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Uhanj or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or ill during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients who have been treated after leaving the hospital may again be carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal for an extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or decreased levels of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had leukocyte lymphoma < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparaginine aminotransferase and viraemia.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobine were found, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell sediment.
In patients with severe disease, D-dimer levels, the product of fibrin breakdown present in the blood was increased and lymphocyte counts decreased steadily.
In most patients with COVID-19 in chest X-rays, pathologies characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or eclipses of the type of “matte glass” in the lungs were found.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lesions and acute respiratory disease (PRD).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to significant gas exchange disruption.
Pneumocyte dysfunction of types I and II reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of the fall of the lungs.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study often coincide with the most serious cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the secretion of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalinic membranes and inter-tissue lymphocyte infiltration, and the multi-nuclear syncitial cells in light patients who died from disease correspond to the pathologies of viral infection and ODR and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false results that could accelerate the rate of epidemic development, since 13 February 2020 China has been diagnosed with clinical manifestations (not relying solely on reverse transcription CDs).
The diagnosis of SARS was similar.
Thus, it is critical and necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-rays for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists under the guidance of Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology based on the repeat CRISPR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows for the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of 20 × 10–18 mol/l up to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) by means of indicators less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if tested successfully on clinical preparations, may significantly increase the sensitivity and convenience of the tests.
Owing to the lack of experience with the previously unknown coronary virus, doctors can provide patients with COVID-19 only with supportive therapy while attempting to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirals, immunosuppressors, steroids, plasma of recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovering patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2, it attacks mainly light and possibly less than other ACE2-expressors, such as gastrointestinal tracts and kidneys.
However, labour violations and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentrations, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of lungs, is critical in order to facilitate symptoms and save lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapuulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks and protecting vital organs is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storms are known to be the result of hyperactivity of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the secretion of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNα and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immunocytes to emit an enormous number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ODS and polyorganism deficiency.
Immunity suppression is essential when treating cytokine storms, especially in patients in severe condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat cytokine storms.
Other treatments for cytokine storms based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-α, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histoneacetalase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as providers of immunity.
However, large-dose steroids do not benefit from the treatment of severe leukaemia in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially atrial osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no evidence of effective antiviral therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved effective in treating an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antiviral agent originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesire also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNA, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this data, Gilead provided this drug to China for the purpose of conducting even research on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, Baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, rhinitis, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medicinal products intended for patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovery patients and antibody production
Blood loss in patients who have been cured of infectious disease for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of the healthy population has long been used.
And in fact, the blood of recovering patients often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize and target individual pathogen molecules.
Based on this assumption, plasma was released from blood samples from a group of patients treated with COVID-19, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation and viral load decreased, and their blood saturation with oxygen increased.
However, in order to encourage the use of this method by mass before specific therapy is carried out, it is necessary to carry out an unverified inspection and an unexplained explanation.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully investigated.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emissions syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify the B cells of healthy patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screenings to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can move immediately on to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases for millenniums.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs from the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, since the identification and verification of these components or their optimal combination is difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were considered effective in treating COVID-19.
The largest proportion of healthy patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China, where traditional Chinese medicine was used in the treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Nincia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in the province of Hubei, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only approximately 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of those who recovered (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is a rather harsh comparison, since the assessment should take into account the many other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combination treatments based on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the hospital were significantly lower in patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated solely in Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to experience worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was found to be lower in the group treated by the combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group treated only in Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled research, carried out on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine methods or their combinations.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed by the existence of COVID-19 are mainly apprehensive of acute and even fatal illness, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side-effects such as corticosteroid insomnia, may cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
Early onsets of SARS-induced disease were reported with a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people ' s anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and contacts, as well as to all other people who require it.
Through psychological support, multi-profile psychiatric teams should be established, regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans should be provided, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the transmission chain from infectious animals and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live, weakened vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, prior to initiation of clinical studies, it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when administered to older patients, the model of lethal doses and the degree of protection against zoonotic infections.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and disease clusters caused by the MERS virus originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions have continued to occur, thanks to the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to prevent a raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (on average 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of the coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical flow of disease from thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be associated with the forecasting of disease in patients with COPID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the disease caused by SARS, which was also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7% of whom over 50 years of age, according to the above study 8 866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (on average 66 years versus 51 years), which shows that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COPID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia damage.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive Holangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in the blood reflect the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and are proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease flow, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, the severity of the disease and the prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagus aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine may also be predicted.
These enzymes in large quantities are secreted by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and are excreted in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COPID-19, consideration should be given to data from chest X-rays and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are an immunosuppressor widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the patients who have experienced the disease have developed prevascular osteonecrosis, which has led to life disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, should steroids be used to treat patients with COPID-19, these drugs should be administered in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress because they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high uncertainties and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve the stress of such patients and to help them return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be provided.
According to population studies to date, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to the replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other common colds, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or cause no symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of the disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period may, in their normal lives, be able to spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly hampers epidemiological control.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at the early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently doing a great deal of work by declaring universal quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as by extending the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients identified has been declining, suggesting a slowdown in the rate of epidemic spread.
According to the most optimistic calculations, the outbreak will end by March, and the blackout phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looked much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could strike two thirds of the world ' s population.
The Team of Canadian Specialists reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and recovered from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical flu-like disease.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
It is estimated that Ebola’s fever should have hit a million people and killed half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually under control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV, the infectious ability of SARS-CoV-2 can weaken and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with the material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which means that an oral and fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases may have resulted from hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 people with medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, particularly health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreign workers who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks for the person; both surgical masks and N95 (No. 1860s series) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microcaps of liquid from potentially infected to fly in the air and sit on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the environment.
However, only Class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect from 10 to 80 nm inhales, only 5 per cent of the viruses; SARS-COV-2 virus the same size as SARS-COV, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even the five surgical masks combined, medical personnel who directly contact patients must wear class N95 masks (series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a protective robe that is raced around the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; perhaps the virus was caught in his system through his eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent faceplates or closed-type safety glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectants, to avoid leaving their homes while maintaining self-insulation and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The distance to the patient is considered to be about a metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high level of its similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a worrisome signal for China, taking into account the experience it had acquired during the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the Director of the Uhanj Center for Disease Control reassure the citizens by saying that the new virus has low contagion and limited reproductive capacity when transferred from person to person and that prevention and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement has greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be restrained within Mr. Ukhahn with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain the potential epidemic at its early stages than to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly verify and improve public response.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by a previously unexplored major acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered all China and at the time of writing it spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a sensation of SARS relapsing occurred at the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and the rate of death among older persons is also higher than among young people.
SARS deaths are higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomable, while SARS patients usually infect the environment only in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 is spreading much faster and wider than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may once again show positive responses to the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of virus transmission.
Against the backdrop of this rapid development of the COVID-19 studies, some critical issues remain pending, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96 per cent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred from bats.
What animal has become an intermediate species that transmits the virus from its original host, for example, from flying mice to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the route of transmission, and the epidemiological situation may worsen at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into respiratory cells and induced subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with producing ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide prompt and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a world pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS, or will it periodically replicate a similar flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation stimulated the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millenniums.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronarys (HCOVs) caused mild disease, such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronary infection can be.
The emergence of the second-type acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 has again attracted the attention of the coronarys and has surprised us with the high transmission capacity but the less pronounced pathogenicity of the virus compared to the SARS-CoV related virus.
Coronavirus infection is a zoonose, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most of the human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses may also shed light on the pathogenosis of the coronary virus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of inter-view transfer.
It is important to note that we compare and compare the various human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current disease epidemic caused by the coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions for successful replacement and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar RNA thread.
These viruses, with the largest number of RNA-containing viruses with a genome containing 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, have been named by their form, which resembles the crown when viewed under an electronic microscope.
From the point of view of the structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with the same organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genomes contain two large open-ended, partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to polyproteins of replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open-label reading framework for structured proteins, including barbed protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of line-specific accessories are also encoded in other lines of coronaviruses.
Based on the differences in the sequences of protein\ coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), the type of betaconavirus includes the majority of human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and betaconaviruses, whereas birds are the main source of gamma and deltaconaviruses.
For thousands of years, the Coroners have repeatedly overcome inter-species barriers, some of which have evolved to man - made pathogens.
To date, seven human coronarys are known.
These include human HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Human Cronaviruses HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually produce symptoms of light form such as cold and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infectious diseases in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (PRD) and signs of extraneous symptoms.
The first strand of HCOV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients separated from the nostalgia who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have accumulated more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronary infection was generally considered harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronary virus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the trigger of the current outbreak of coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 lives as of 3 March 2020, and the number of infected persons exceeded 91,000.
An alarming signal has been received and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronarys have zoonotic origins, their sources are bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets show the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses have adapted well and in which they do not manifest pathogenic properties, but demonstrate broad genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
A study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent future recurrence of the disease.
This review provides an overview of the zoonotic origin, inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common features: the baseline viruses from which human coronaviruses have occurred are not usually pathogenic to their reservoirs, but are pathogenic to the new host after inter-viewal transmission.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also being considered.
Animal coronation has been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HCOV-229E virus was first derived from a sample of patients who had a cold removed from the nostalgia, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronarys have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCOV-229E was derived from samples taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract damage in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the reproduction in the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general indigestion and sore throat, with a high temperature and cough observed in 10-20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was extracted from organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of mice.
The clinical signs of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCOV-229E, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and renoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 virus are widespread in the world and are generally transmitted in winter in moderate latitudes.
The main incubation period of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately a two-week illness.
According to a study by volunteers, normal light - form colds have developed in healthy subjects infected with the HCOV-229E virus.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity had severe lower respiratory tract infections.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as “an epidemic of atypical pneumonia”, was the first well documented pandemic in human history, and the virus SARS-CoV, the third of the detected human coronaviruses, was the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdu Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and disease spread across many countries and continents.
Without taking into account superactive spreaders, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two others; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the viral load was 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise and oesophagus, and among the later symptoms were respiratory, cough and respiratory insufficiency.
Lymphopenia, liver disorders and elevated creatinine levels are common laboratory deviations from SARS.
Patients with SARS also experienced diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
Other organs, including gastrointestinal tracts, livers and kidneys, may also be infected in such severe cases, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was released from an open biopsy of a sick relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to study human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was awarded to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found to be primarily affecting children of younger age, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCOV-NL63, there are manifestations such as wrinkle, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but it is actually widespread.
HCOV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7 per cent of the common respiratory disease and the peak of its disease is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a circle.
HCOV-HKU1 was awarded to Hong Kong in the same year by 71-year-old men hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to non-abdominal pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCOV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1 virus, causing light respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronarys causing non-patient infections have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, with highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent HCOV-NL63 subtype, which has reportedly caused serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, by gaining the ability to transmit effectively and to remain in the human body, these human coronarys become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first released in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, import cases were recorded and the spread through occasional secondary cases of infestation in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal insufficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transferable coronarys.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and rhinitis.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of high mortality Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) have been reported, therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most lethal viruses known to man.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of December 2019, in Uhan Province of China, Hubey identified pneumonic patient clusters, which are now associated with a type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome.
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency and the disease itself has been called “Coronavirus 19” (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with approximately 3.4 per cent of deaths.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei Province in China is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS, causes severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and respiration.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly undergo acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has a greater ability to transmit than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Cases of unsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronarys reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human-borne coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronarys.
Secondly, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronarys causing non-patient infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is similar to that most frequently observed in human coronaviruses causing non-patient infections, including non-specific symptoms, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of COVID-19 serious cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 also notes the interesting patterns that characterize both human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronarys causing non-patient infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to verify that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person) is decreasing, as is the case with SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause extra-patient infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in faeces samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is also of particular interest that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have a seasonality characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause non-patient infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after human transition.
All four human coronarys, causing non-patient infections with mild form symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronations.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronary pandemics in the past.
Human coronations that cause serious diseases in humans and those with severe diseases in humans have simply not survived.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract carrier restraints.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult for people to stop it by quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.
For many years, four extra-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reserve animal.
The highly pathogenic coronarys SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transfer to humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and reproduce in their zoos and to seek out vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOV non-patient viruses.
It's very easily transmitted as an extracurricular HCOV, at least at the moment.
But it's more pathogenic than the HCOV, and it's less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to human beings and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCOV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and reservoir carriers of HCV viruses.
An animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCOV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
An ancestor virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the tank carrier has been carrying HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCOV or its parental virus.
By contrast, if HCOV was only carried into the intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was carried to a person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing carrier, allowing the virus to be lightning replicated and then passed on to people by increasing the extent of human contamination.
HCOV may carry a blunt infection if it cannot withstand transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCOV viruses can also adapt to intermediate carriers and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that SARS patient zero had a history of contact with hunting animals (chicken).
Further studies on seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the population as a whole.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the ossuary dog in the animal markets have become the first to bear viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was implicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all cinnamon in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan civets, living in nature or on farms and not entering markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not determined, which leads to the conclusion that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifier rather than a natural SARS-CoV tank.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to rule out the likelihood that numerous species of small mammals can also be used as intermediate amplifiers.
They all appear to be deadlocked carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
Subsequent search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV has detected a closely related CoV of flying mice, which is called the HKU3 (SARSRr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese horseshoe flying mice.
These mice are positive for the antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
These and other mouse coronaviruses have the same homology of nucleotides sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in bats, but none of them, except one that denotes WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from the sample of fly mouse feces uses ACE2 flying mice, civet and human as a receptor for entry into the cell.
It is interesting that the serums of SARS-treated patients could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative to SARS-CoV in bats, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct carrier of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis refers to MERS-COV as the same group as the CV-HKU4 of bats and the CV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of betacoronaviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and its close relative, CoV-HKU25, only coincides with 87 per cent.
That is, bats could not have been the immediate carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are seropositive of neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, has been extracted from the nasal mascots of single-tailed camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV tank carriers.
It is also worth noting that there have been minor symptoms, but massive virification, of camels that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is notable that infected camels have released the virus not only by respiratory route but also by fecal and oral means, which is also the main way of releasing the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have had no contact with camels prior to symptoms and are likely to be related to human transmission or transmission via unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides by 96.2% coincides with the CoV RaTT13 of bats in Asian Rhinophus affinis horseshoes.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the diversification of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTT13 is too great to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, bats could not have been a direct SARS-CoV-2 reservoir unless nearly identical floating mouse coronaviruses were found in the future.
Supposedly, direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the fragrant wholesale market for marine products, with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a possible case of animal transfer.
Several recent studies based on metageneous sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangoline (Manis javanica) could also tolerate parental betacoronavirus, related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotides sequences of these new pangolin rootovirus genomes is 85-92% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to the RAG13, with the identity at the nucleotide sequence level being about 90%.
They are classified in two lines of differentiation of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an identical amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
On the contrary, the RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTT13 are more diversified, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported the identification of viral contagions in light samples, which were thus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a sequence of the genome, which includes about 86.3 per cent of the full-dimensional viral genome.
It cannot be excluded that pangoline has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the diversification of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin- related betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTT13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin- related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTT13 had the highest homology of sequences throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The counter-proposal advocates a recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betaconaviruses.
The final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not available.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from the coronaviruses of flying mice, while parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronation of bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected by a North American three-colored foot shows a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be camels.
For the sake of clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the HCOV inter-species transmission in history.
When the HCOV-OC43 virus was transmitted inter-speciesly around 1890 and humans were infected with domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of the HCOV-229E inter-species transmission is not so clear.
Lactating mice, close-born HCOV-229E, have been detected.
There is an alpha-coronavirus of alpaca.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it is people, not alpaki, who have been able to contact bats in the common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpaca.
Second, the HCOV-229E- related alpha-coronaviruses are varied and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-coronavirus alpaki has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus alpaca was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be excluded that alpaca have received an alpha-coronavirus related to HCOV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipach virus and Hendra virus.
It is no wonder, therefore, that bats could directly pass HCOV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-coronaviruses of bats could serve as a gene pool of the HCOV-229E virus, alpaca and lone camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV provides an excellent example of inter-species handovers from bats to lone camels and single camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for inter-species gene-sharing and inter-species transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make bats “ideal spreaders”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-armed camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate carrier have become a stable and natural reservoir.
The MERS-CoV virus in these animals causes very mild disease and is characterized by relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its occasional transfer to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline population.
They may be deadlocked carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, bats can be a reservoir for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an environmental niche with bats by mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolines may be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which the SARS-COV-2 related virus has recently fallen.
Humans are infected with the virus by cutting carcases and eating wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have taken place in a third form, which had been in contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main factors of viruses have also contributed to cross-sectional barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replications.
Compared to other single-circuit RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “moderately high” with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 per year on one site of 2 depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have an adjustment for exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even incapacitated.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesire suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical studies.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Supposedly, the virus has already adapted to another carrier close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, a large RNA gene in coronaviruses results in more genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species evolution conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by the numerous unique open reading and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3'-end genome.
Thirdly, because of the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses accidentally and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which is a mixed vessel, there is often a switch of thread.
High-level full-dimensional and sub-geneous RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and animal coronaviruses such as SL-COV and BatCOV-HKU9 bat mice.
Interaction of carrier virus with regard to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important for inter-species transmission.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in cross-species events, of the SARS-CoV combination.
Based on a comparative analysis of human SARS-CoV strains and civets, it is considered that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to S-Bellow RSD mutations.
In general, S coronavirus protein RSD interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier's antibody response strongly selects it.
The RSD for SARS-CoV is amino acids, from 318 to 510, on S1, which is linked to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans and its correceptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to identify the receptors of the APF2 of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and annotated dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus inter-species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, which are different from human viral strains and civets, of which 4 are in the receptor binding motive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interface of the chiropractic protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acids substitutes may be of particular importance in adapting the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S segment leads to changes in the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than that of APF2 than that of APF2 of humans and S of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other controllers were required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCOV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetylsilic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after inter-species transfer from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the inter-species transmission of HCOV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and carrier limitation.
The diversification of these carrier proteins between humans and natural HCoVs reservoirs, such as bats, camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission of HCOV, it is necessary to usurp dependency factors and submit carrier restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in impartial full-genome screening of carrier dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Emerging new HCOV: back to zero mark
The variety of coronaviruses of bats creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessories, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since the SARS-CoV related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to code divergent ORF8 proteins.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide fraction characteristic of SARS-CoV was detected.
This delegation breaks the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and considers it to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the replacement of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible combinations with alpha- and gammaconavirus lines where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The localizations of the recombinant were also determined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in the one-tailed camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV has been associated with other animals with coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which is likely to result from the release of the virus from selective pressures such as the carrier's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-dimensional ORF4 in the HCOV-229E prototype strain due to a two-nucleotide fraction.
While an intact open-ended ORF4 reading framework can be observed in the virus of flying mice and camels related to HCOV-229E, the alpha-coronavirus of alpaca demonstrates a single nucleotide insert, leading to a change of frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
Infecting bats with coronaviruses, poor or absent symptoms have been reported, indicating mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and the bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, the defects in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by the coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the adjustment of the inhibitory receptor of natural NKG2/CD94 cells and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, a high level of active oxygen forms, which is ensured by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus by simultaneously influencing the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating selectivity pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when introduced into the new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of the coronary virus may also evolve due to recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last twenty years there have been three new human coronations.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as bats or camels.
They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response from the carrier.
This is the secret to why we see unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly related to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the loss of the lungs.
On the contrary, the immune response of non-symptomatic carriers does not involve the replication of the coronary virus.
The same immune non-response strategy may have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the intake of interferon I type, at least in the initial phase of SARS-COV-2 infection, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammase was disrupted by bats.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammase by MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common scheme that created SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While betacoronavirus of bats has been found, 95 per cent of which is 95 per cent identical with SARS-CoV, there is also a mouse coronaravirus with a 96 per cent nucleotide homology with SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 were not directly installed.
Pangoline betacoronaviruses, amazingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been detected, suggesting that pangolines could have been one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangoline betacoronavirus genes could have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses have attracted universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCOV animal reserves in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from flying mice and were transferred to a person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV is caused by contact between people and civets in the markets, the closure of wild markets and the destruction of civets could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed in order to prevent the zoonotic transmission of infection from the food markets, in the light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin betacoronaviruses close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolines and other mammals and how this may remain a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long been found in single camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and fur products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels combined with other infectious control measures to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks of the disease.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, there are a wide variety of zoonotic mouse coronaviruses.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which will in the future lead to new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary human-animal contacts, a culture of use of wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned.
After severe tests, such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
While many properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, learning to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is required, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from human beings and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the environmental niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the zoo puzzle SARS-CoV-2, some fragments are still missing.
First, if bats passed the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances flying mice and pangolines share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in handing over humans, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate is played by a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a flying mouse, pangoline or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessors will be identified by their natural carriers in the future.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief background guide on diagnosis and treatment of a new coronary infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides clear recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspected disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019 there was a outbreak of a new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus disease itself was called “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-COV-2).
WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a brief reference guide and published it on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven editions of the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were issued and some of its provisions have changed significantly.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) and contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has provided valuable background information on the global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (test seventh version) and the results of ongoing studies, and their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (since 3 March 2020), a single element of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease must be combined in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis in support of the case of suspected disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or residences in Uhan and its vicinity or other settlements where cases of COPID-19 have been reported within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhanj and its surrounding areas or other human settlements where cases of COPID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of confirmed patients (≥ 2 cases characterized by high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered for 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total leukocyte counts are normal or decreased with reduced lymphocyte counts at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case of the disease should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following pathogens or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the complete genomic sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneousity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) the positive results of the serotype for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or the change in the result of the test with a negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to IgG, or the increase of titre at least 4 times in the recovery phase of the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020), a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in airways or blood samples was added.
Pathogenic blood tests were added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then the seventh edition added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for an optimal set of nucleic acid detection for rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the airways, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the validation criteria.
However, there is increasing evidence that caution should be exercised when treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou and others should be updated, since it categorizes those without clinical symptoms as a “low risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in those countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in time to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the biggest death rate of the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases of infection were reported, as well as 33 patients who were at home.
In all, 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, IEDCR Director Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two died over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COPID-19 pandemic.
A clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadolu that Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead at the Maitry Kuwaiti Clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, stated that public transport would be discontinued for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport had been suspended since 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March by two persons who returned from Italy and by the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, the three people had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millions of infections worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary infection worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COPID-19.
Russia came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia recorded the first case of death from the coronary virus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which there were no reported cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 in Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stronger measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergey Sobianin, extended the regime of self-insolidation of the city's citizens until 1 May.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin had stated that Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would receive salaries up to 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted in favour of extending the state of emergency by 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the curfew had previously lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the regime of domestic isolation in the state was extended by order until 1 May.
Magazines in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Coles stores have reduced the amount of toilet paper packages that can be purchased once in all shops in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions have been reported in cassette announcements as well as on the Facebook web page.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make emergency supplies because of the fear that COVID-19 may lead to a regime of general isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, Woolworths and Coles, respectively, had already limited this number to 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, the Coles Network reported that with the imposition of a four-pack limit, “in many stores, toilet paper is still being bought too quickly — one delivery within an hour”, and called such a demand “unforeseen”, while ALDI, in a Facebook post published on Tuesday, referred to this trend as “unsurprising”.
According to a representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco magazine in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, Coles has ordered larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths has ordered additional shipments, while ALDI has made reserves for the special stock of early sale on the environment.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, reported that the Retailers were trying to restock, but this was difficult due to restrictions on local authorities regarding the timetable for the carriage of trucks.
It expects the cost of products to increase as suppliers try to meet demand, but less and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the depletion of stocks, some stores were not able to share in the environment.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in retail trade at the University of Queensland, said that stores were stocking up every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the number of warehouses was small and after the sale of the entire product, the long stacks of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of stock shortages.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these regiments in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic, ” says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of processed toilet paper, Who Givens a Krap, reported the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper manufacturer, also producing Sorbent, reported that they work around the clock to ensure sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to the lack of buyers on the week of Labor Day, some real estate vendors began to offer free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The fourth edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, stores initially reluctantly imposed restrictions on the number of goods purchased, claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefited from increased demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British supermarket Ocado online magazine also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the COPID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COPID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemic” is characterized only by the extent of the disease, rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that action needs to be taken by the Governments of countries:
“All countries are still able to influence the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are involved in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation of the sick, monitoring and mobilization of their citizens,” explained the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana Gebreisus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unforeseen”.
He said in his interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than flu has been monitored since its emergence until its continued global spread”.
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronary virus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of this disease an international public health emergency and then adopted a new status — the pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, responded to the outbreak: “This is only the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide on Thursday, more than 4,600 people have died.
Coronary pandemic 2019-2020 is a current coronary disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COPID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from first symptoms to peak is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive: recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing, distance between humans, identification and self-insulation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk management and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of goods compounded by panic-purchase.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world ' s students.
Disinformation on the virus began to be disseminated on the Internet, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who resemble them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus transmission were reported.
As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of heavy-duty industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Uhanj, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported pneumonia for unknown reasons, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Cases of infection were mainly related to the wholesale market for Juanan products, and the virus was believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently opened virus that is very similar to that of bats, pangoline and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and the infected one did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were relevant to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the South China office of Morning Post, whose information was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of Hubay Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had declined but that it had increased unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infection outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly understated, in particular due to the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection had been reported among young people, with patients 19 years of age and younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of the world ' s cases, and the Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Wallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established among the population.
Statistics include cases of contamination of persons who have been tested on COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted to prevent testing of only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March revealed that 86% of cases of COVID-19 infection had not been detected in China before 23 January, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of baseline reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well-treated.
In other, more complex cases, the time between the onset of symptoms and the time of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most common period being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, while 75 per cent of deaths had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COPID-19 pandemic usually included information on the deaths of patients with positive COVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested — for example, in the event of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Inadequate data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official levels for COVID 4-5 times.
The Secretary of the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the claimed number of deaths] is below the actual number”. His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States.
The first death outside mainland China was registered in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the beginning of the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health, and the mortality/disease rate is the number of deaths divided into the number of diagnosed cases of infection over the given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
Data vary from region to region.
In China, mortality rate to morbidity decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those who had symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods included the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR) — the percentage of patients who were diagnosed with disease and the percentage of death from infection (IFR), which reflected the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Centre for Evidence Medicine, the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test at COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash shall not be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Bonnie, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually come out on the plateau and then, when the number of accessible carriers of the disease ends, they begin to fade.
In the current situation, however, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanchan, claims that “everything can end by June”, if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is established”, physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University staff member, believes that “I don’t think the corona virus will ever disappear at all because it is transmitted so easily” and that it “can become a seasonal disease every year”.
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the airways (tears), loss of smell, breathing, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, ostrich, rheumatism, haemorrhagic, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims that it is serious with the development of respiratory problems of about 1 in 6 people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory failure, permanent pain or chest pain, sudden sensation of confusion, difficulty in awakening and bruising of the face or lips. If these symptoms occur, medical attention should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may experience an unsymptomable disease without clinical evidence, but the results of the analyses confirm the fact of the infection, so doctors recommend placing persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict control and screening for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of non-symptomable cases varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; so far, there is no complete clarity on the symptoms of odour loss: it is estimated that the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how to spread the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops emitted into the air with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open coughing can extend between 4.5 metres (15 feet) and 8.2 metres (27 feet).
It is assumed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops emitted during conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops can also be formed at the exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not airborne.
The chapels can reach the mouth or nose of people around them, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SPD), may lead to the dispersion of the exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if the person concerns the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of fecal oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may occur both prior to symptoms and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests were positive for three days prior to symptoms and this suggests that the virus may be transmitted prior to symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unsymptomable disease, but some countries have also identified cases of disease transmission from unsympathetic carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2 to 3 other people; the virus can survive on surfaces for several hours to a few days.
In particular, it has been found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus is able to live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surface for up to four hours.
These data vary, however, depending on humidity and temperature, with positive results from domestic and other animals for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just like, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first detected by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of the related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It's supposed to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronary virus showed that it is genetically classified with the genus Betacronavirus, the genus Sarbecovirus (B cell line), along with two other strains of bat virus.
At the whole-genome level, it is 96 per cent identical to other samples of batCov ratG13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genema of igneous and human viruses.
A comprehensive and genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) exists between the pangoline and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolines are intermediate hosts of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by analysing the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCD) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of the study comparing the PCR to the CT method used in Uhan have shown that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols at SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is carried out.
It can be performed on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready over a period of several hours to several days.
The test is usually carried out using a nostalgic ointment, although also using a zebra ointment, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of X-ray and computer tomography (CT) are asymmetric peripheral disturbances by type of matte glass and lack of pleural extremities.
The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to similarity with other infections such as adenovirus, the identification of COPID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests has limited clinical specificities.
China had conducted a major study comparing breast cell CT and PCR testing, and it was found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered faster; they were also more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, bridging neural networks have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
Prevention strategies include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose or lips with dirty hands, coughing or sneezing napkins that should be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who have already become infected should wear a medical mask in people’s places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated from them, and many Governments recommend that they refrain from any immediate visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreaks and restrict the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population whose members do not know where and how they have been infected, and medical personnel who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions and precautions in contact with other people and eye protection; contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International) and more than 100 other organizations have made statements requiring that this type of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions to ensure privacy of personal data, such as registration of user proximity to other mobile phones through Bluetooth technology.
If the user of a mobile phone has been in close contact with a person whose test on COVID-19 has been positive, he will be notified accordingly. There are also groundless versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and mouth scratching, which is actually ineffective.
Currently, there is no vaccine from COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash hands.
The CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand pollution, as well as before food, after snorting, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because when the virus is outside the human body, it is destroyed by domestic soap that covers its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of hand sanitizers on an alcohol-based basis with a alcohol content of not less than 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, noses or lips with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel, the disinfectant starts to work minutes after application) with 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen per cent and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent hydrogen per cent povidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an institution, such as an office or a day station, all such premises, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that coughing or sneezing cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately discard the hygiene items used.
It is recommended that those who may have been infected use medical masks, since the use of the mask may limit the volume and range of breath products dispersed in the air during conversation, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is a major way of infecting them”.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, of persons who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask actually reduces the number of touches.
Several countries have started calling for medical masks in public places.
CDC centres, U.S.A., recommend wearing non-medical tissue masks, and China has emphasized separately the importance of using one-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 m (3 m) or less) with other people.
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand encourage people to make and wipe facial tissue masks in their home environment daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go outside without masks closing their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to food shops to wearing medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks have been produced daily since mid-March, medical masks have been ordered for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were obliged to wear a medical mask when they went outside; those who were unable to obtain masks were recommended to sew them themselves in domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the people of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close human contact.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding people ' s places, using non-contact greetings and distances physically from others.
Many Governments in the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distances.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place, as recommended by the United States government authorities and health organizations, has been rapidly reduced, from 250 (in regions where there were no data on the distribution of COVID-19) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited more than two persons from joining groups: older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of serious disease. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if the region is experiencing an outbreak of disease. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the objective of reducing physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or with physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood in such a way that people should be totally excluded from social exclusion, rather than remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways, and some agencies published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations have been made to have sexual relations only with your permanent partners with whom you are confident that they do not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspected of being infected were recommended self-insulation in domestic settings.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be quarantined on their own.
The most stringent quarantine was prescribed for high-risk groups.
Persons who may have contacted infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region affected by the epidemic were advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
The strategies to combat outbreaks include preventing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The containment of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected and implies other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
Suppression of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below level 1. Part of the control of the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburden of health services and give more time to develop vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help deal with outbreaks include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and isolation; public measures aimed at physical distances, such as school closures and the abolition of mass events; community involvement in the implementation and participation of such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning; once the seriousness of the outbreak has become apparent in China, there has been stronger action to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a warning system on the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to the self-insulated infected persons and fines were imposed on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and penalties were increased for the accumulation of surplus supplies of medicines. The United Kingdom and the United States model showed that there were serious problems in reducing (deceleration but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
The optimal policy of mitigating the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak health burden by 2/3 and mortality by twice, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
The suppression may be a preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates to the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
Antivirals approved for the treatment of COPID-19 are not currently available but are being developed, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking unreceptive medicines from the cold, drinking enough fluid and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic resources” could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO views capacity-building and adaptation to the needs of patients with COPID-19 as a major response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to help redistribute resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory testing services at COVID-19, the elimination of non-recurrent procedures, where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as the expansion of intensive therapy facilities through training of staff and the increase in the number of IVL and coca devices available.
There are different theories as to where the first case of infection might have occurred — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of infection of a new coronary infection was likely to have occurred on 1 December 2019 in Uhan Province of Hubay, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronary infection in Hubay province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the wholesale market for Juanan products, where living animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus penetrated the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin. On 26 December, there was a case of a massive disease of unknown-origin pneumonia at the clinic of Hubei Province, which was reported by Doctor Zhang Tianjin, on 27 December at the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Centre in Uhan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central clinic of Uhan warned their colleagues about a “Coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlyan, were warned by the police about the responsibility of spreading false rumors, and Ai Fen, a doctor, received an excuse from her superiors for having panicked.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Ukhania published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The Ukhania health authorities reported an unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate the investigation in early January, and at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, facilitated by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenchen.
As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. More than 1.61 million cases of infection had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had been killed and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered case of infection.
As a result of the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and border control.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory housekeeping, compulsory shelter or isolation) and curfew. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were quarantined, more than 50 million were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later, the figure rose to 2.6 billion — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COPID-19 was registered in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, which was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisyan's doctor worked in a case of a mass pneumonia of unknown type, which her clinic notified on 27 December was the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Uhan.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed a SARS-like coronary virus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhanya issued a public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhan of the responsibility for spreading rumours of outbreaks.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Si Xinpin, as the “national war”.
The events of the “largest quarantine in human history” began to unfold, and on 23 January, the border of sanitation and the ban on entry into and return to Uhan was announced, and a total of about 57 million people were later extended to 15 towns in Hubei Province.
The use of personal transport was banned in the city.
Celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshengshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Laishenchen, was built, which accommodated other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also reclassified 14 other institutions in Uhana, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote regime of work.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubay province.
The timetable for public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a regime for the control of the movement of citizens was introduced and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) had faced some form of restrictions on the movement in the open air, after the outbreak had entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
In Beijing, for example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was imposed for all international travellers entering the city, and as at 23 March, only one case of intra-country infection was recorded in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Lee Ketian of China reported that the spread of diseases transmitted internally had been largely stopped and the outbreak in China was under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubay, other than Uhanya, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume work and provided companies with money-credit stimulus packages. On 4 April, a national three-minute “minute silence” was held at 10 a.m., which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the festival of Quinmin, but the central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, while observing the physical distance to avoid the recurrence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases of disease, largely due to the gathering of a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji in Tegu.
Shincheonji's followers came to Tegu from Uhanya, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported having symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was reported in South Korea.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were recorded in Korea, and on 29 February, this figure had increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had confirmed the presence of the virus.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, so the timetable for airline flights has been changed, and South Korea has launched a screening programme for the presence of a virus, contact tracking and quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through mobile applications by all those who came from abroad, head-on testing of the virus, the results of which were prepared the following day, and increased testing capabilities that allowed testing to be performed daily for up to 20,000 people.
The South Korean programme is considered to be successful in combating the outbreak, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there, and the South Korean society was initially divided by the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon ' s impeachment for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had registered the lowest total number of cases of infection in one day for four weeks.

On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit cross-border travel were announced in March, but the intensive movement between cities prior to the Persian New Year continued.
The Shiite shrines in Kum remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of the allegations of a cover-up in Iran, by 28 February more than ten countries had linked their disease to Iran, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak there could be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (On Human Rights Watch) called on the Iranian prison leadership to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful purposes and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The Organization claims that there is an increased risk of virus spread in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths registered in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronary disease had been reported every hour in Iran, and one new death from the coronary virus was reported every ten minutes.
According to a WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
The US sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the mitigation of economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease hit Italy when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2 in Rome had a positive effect.
The number of cases of infection has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and declare an emergency.
Later, an unassociated cluster of COVID-19 infections was discovered. It began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree to contain the outbreak, which placed more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy under quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "The entry and exit of the disease will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as there were already 100 deaths recorded in Italy.

On 22 March, it was known that Russia had dispatched nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, 128,948 confirmed cases of coronary infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery had been confirmed in Italy, most of which had been concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report noted that such a high mortality rate in Italy could be facilitated by a combination of two factors — a large number of elderly citizens of that country and a lack of opportunity to examine all those who are currently suffering from the disease.
The United Kingdom responded most calmly to the virus from all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to respect any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticised for its lack of rapid and serious response to the danger faced by the country ' s population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all travels and social contacts of no priority, offering people wherever possible to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their salaries, but not more than £2,500 per month as a measure of support during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures for social distances, prohibiting more than two persons from gathering and limiting travel and active recreation in the fresh air only in cases of extreme need.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the dispatch of human beings.
Most enterprises were ordered to be shut down, except for enterprises that provide “life for the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, auto-fuelling stations and garages.

Despite this, the testing of the population in the United States was not immediately initiated, and the real extent of the outbreak was hidden during that period.
The testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of the permission of the Federal Government to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done upon the appointment of a treating doctor).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.

On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and to contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted the apparent differences between the situation of the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and suppression of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “shall regularly provide updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic before the Chinese New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to ban the movement of transport in Uhan, WHO representative Goden Galea noted that although “this measure was definitely recommended by WHO”, it was also “very important to confirm the implementation of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the site of the greatest spread”, and called it “unforeign in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected countries in other countries, WHO declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); the situation became the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the PHEIC announcement was attributable to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade”, and that “WHO recommends no restriction on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “have no systems to detect people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the level of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called upon the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay for the future”. At the 11 February press conference, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the “potential of the entire United Nations system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the UN Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on health response, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc group, which ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the internal situation and assessing “the severity of the disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of provincial and district responses, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “peace must do more to prepare for a possible coronary pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call this pandemic disease, but that countries must nevertheless be ready”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the potential for global proliferation would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a verification of every government on the planet ' s readiness for action: it is time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country and you need to be ready," and stressed that the right responses could help the world to avoid “worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not serve as a basis for declaring the global pandemic public health officials, and added that the declaration of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronary virus a pandemic.
WHO Director-General stated that “WHO is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in relation to the problem”. WHO is being seriously criticized for considering an inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the later declaration of public health emergencies and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adanom, Director-General of WHO, was petitioned to resign, signed by 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to apply life-saving measures to him and that the Government had the responsibility to organize such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not justify discrimination against any particular group.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health care, including those with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the crisis associated with COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital node provides information on the policy measures of the various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonaru, the son of Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonar, for taking action to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubay.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in the central part of China, and these dismissals have shown dissatisfaction with the response of the political militia to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinpin, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus began in Uhan but took sides with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had originated in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration Donald Trump called the “Coronavirus of China” or “Uhania virus”, saying that “Censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “detracts from the inability of the U.S. Presidential Administration to contain the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast has access to the U.S. Government Telegram, which contains a communicational strategy, apparently designed by the National Security Council, with such references to the strategy: “Everything in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of the “advocacy effort” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy agency, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the fight for influence through piracy and the so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is persistently promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports sending assistance to the last two countries.
The donation of Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the US sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy, also had disputes about medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IDPs to Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for Italy ' s coronal virus.
Mauricio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “only China has reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not show European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged the dispatch of Russian military medics, specialized disinfection transport and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or of little value to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world community at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardi Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected the attacks by the media and expressed their gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia has also dispatched a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] implies that when American medical equipment and materials manufacturers increase their production rate, they will also be able to respond if necessary”.
NATO's defence 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — NATO's largest military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, has criticised the teachings of Defender 2020 (Defender-2020): “In the crisis situation that has taken place today in the field of public health, the conduct of these exercises threatens not only the military and many European participating countries but also the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Government of Iran has been seriously affected by the virus, and some two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, requested the assistance of world leaders, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic had issued calls for the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other major countries, including the introduction of a single health system and care system for children paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had exacerbated diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticised Japan ' s “simply and passive quarantine measures” after Japan has announced that any citizen from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-specific locations.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for the impeachment of Mr. Moon for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease; the pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of allowing Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to manage through decrees, suspend the work of parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fairytale information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was attributed to several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of anti-epidemic equipment, the accumulation of goods in panic and the collapse of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Food and Drug Quality Control issued a warning that there was a shortage of medicines and medical equipment, which was due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in the work of suppliers.
In several locations, panic purchases have also taken place; this has led to the disappearance of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which, in turn, has led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for individual protection has increased by 100 times.
This jump has led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the supply of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection worldwide, and WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, the daigou system buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China due to the pandemic.
This activity has led to a lack of child nutrition in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COPID-19 in Northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products, which have been successful, have avoided the acute food shortage expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but industry believes that agricultural prices may grow.
Food stores were only temporarily empty, even in the town of Ukhan, while Chinese government officials had made available pig stocks to ensure the full feeding of the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve emergency food stocks exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy had impacted China: according to the media of 16 March, China's economy had been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken to combat the spread of the virus by the Government, which had reduced the volume of retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
The mother China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, the viral outbreak is considered a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demaraj, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, market volatility will continue until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could outweigh the effects of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
According to an assessment made by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last for up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take urgent measures after the sharp decline in oil prices due to the decline in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed because of a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, owing to growing fears about the outbreak of the coronavirus, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow-Jones index for industrial companies' shares, showed the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow index dropping 1191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.
On 28 February, Skopje Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The stock fell again because of fears of the spread of the coronary virus, and the biggest decline occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist sights, and the recommendations of Governments not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has proved to be more powerful than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-youn, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
A number of events involving a large number of people have been cancelled by national and regional Governments, including the annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also shut down their shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events were cancelled and tourist sights were closed to prevent mass accumulations of people; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the New Day holidays until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency by closing schools until March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The retail sector was affected globally: shop hours were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
The visit to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail companies in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, shopping centres dropped 33 to 43 per cent compared with February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of visitors ' temperature control equipment and the abolition of activities. According to the assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave more than 14 to 22 million people out of poverty than it would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of the Uhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers were home to their provinces or imprisoned in Hubay Province, and in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought assistance from the Government.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of the Coronar virus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The self-insolidation measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed who received daily wages. A study conducted by the Institute of Angusa Reida found that 44 per cent of Canadian households faced unemployment anyway. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost their jobs since the establishment of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to a government-sponsored reduced work schedule, a part-time job.
The German part-time salary scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
The areas of art and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic that affected organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Culture and art organizations have tried to support their (often funded by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public and, where possible, supporting people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed around the world for an indefinite period of time, or they had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or moved to other dates.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms: yet another recent and growing trend resulting from the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the lifting of the Week of Passion in Rome during the last week of the Christian period of repentance — the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not attend Sunday services; in some churches church services have begun to broadcast on radio, live or on television, while some church leaders offer outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed the church, the clock and the square of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations have also abolished services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourds.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their own residents from accessing the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be “moved beyond 2020 but no later than 2021”.
This has led many players to switch online, and many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, have also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional off-line operations, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, direct broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
There are many Internet memes on the topic of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smoothing the disturbing moods of times of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as against representatives of the people of the hotspots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February news reports (when most cases of infection were still limited by China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for something.
There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments in some countries in Africa.
Many Uhany and Hubey residents reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China ' s citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel suspicious and xenophobic; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition at an early stage, insisting that Chinese citizens be banned from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, hashtag # ChineseDontcomeToJapan (#ChineseDon't Come to Japan) held leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report an increasing level of racism and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the Chinese virus a coronavirus; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Ukhania to New Sanjara.
Students coming from a north-eastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata State Department, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and “the poet God avenged them”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which referred to them as “misleading”, in China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese nationals have once again erupted: foreigners have become referred to as “foreign garbage” and “resolved” objects.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronary virus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronary virus publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on the content server, such as bioRxiv.
A widespread infectious disease — An infectious disease caused by a returning pathogen, a range or mode of transmission that is often unknown
Globalization and disease — Overview of globalization and the spread of disease

The smuggling of wild animals and diseases transmitted from animals is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognises the RNA of the coronary virus.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody analyses identify the number of people who have experienced the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat in the hospital or were absent.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, there was no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population due to limited testing opportunities in any country.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
These differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on registered mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be used to test the airway samples obtained in various ways, including nostalgic ointment or a wet sample.
The results are usually available over a period of several hours to two days.
The TC-PCR-test carried out on the mouth swabs is only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing to reproduce in the lungs.
In infected patients tested during the second week of the disease, the lower respiratory tract material may be taken as an alternative, using a suction catheter, or wetting products (wetting) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Sharite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and a base of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech had developed a set to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the “E” gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In the United States, BGI Group became one of the first companies to be authorized by the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit on the basis of PCD. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed their diagnostic panel for RT-PCD in real time (2019-New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to lack of reagents and a narrow area of testing conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervisory Office in the framework of an emergency authorization, and US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started testing in COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the blocking and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, a test on COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Oversight Service and it was reported that on 12 March 2020 the Mayo Clinic developed a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for the use of a test that could be carried out for 3.5 hours on a large scale, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation to Abbott (EUA) laboratories for testing Abbott m2000; previously, the FDA issued such a permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of successive temperatures, this method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day, and Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibody test that is specifically related to the N-Belacapsidic protein of the new coronavirus, and there is hope that results can be obtained in 15 to 20 minutes, such as the flu express test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concludes that “the chest x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas the results of the CT [computer tomography] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
Typical signs identified during the CT include bilateral multi-way sub-pleural sealing in the type of “mat glass” with peripheral, asymmetric and aterior distribution.
Subversive domination, bulge bridge symptoms and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has published a recommendation “not to use the CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics”. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends that the PCR method be used for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may also be used to monitor the immune response.
In POCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection phase is not required for sampling. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to pass their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European permission to use their test kits that can detect antibodies IgG and IgA in blood samples capable of fighting the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples over several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection, and in early April, Britain found that none of its antibody analysis kits were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of staying at home: “emergency staff pass a sample to the patient”, the patient spits in it, returns it and receives the results of the test after some time. The British NHS announced that it would launch its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases in domestic conditions, which would eliminate the risk of infection by the patient to other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance stated that it was ready to run about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and that only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs shall be covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koh Institute, Germany's total test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was proposed to conduct an express test in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of not less than 483,295 analyses had been taken at SARS-CoV-2, up to 12/2020, including 33,491 samples (6.9%), and that the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital clinics had developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample showed positive results. In Uhana, on 5 February 2020, a temporary laboratory of 2,000 square metres of emergency detection, called Huo-Yan (Chinese) was opened by BGI, which could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Zhang and completed in only 5 days; modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of Hubei disease would have been 47 per cent higher and consequently quarantine costs would have been twice as high.
At the opening of the Uhana laboratory, Huo-Yan labs in Shenchen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total permeability rate was 50,000 tests per day, with open multi-plexed Origami Assays schematics that can test up to 1,22 patient analyses for COVID19 using only 93 samples. Such balanced structures can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have applied for test samples to be heated at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of coronavirus testing carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita currently exceeds that of any other country, and most of the population will soon be protested.
This was due to the possibility of express testing, along with the acquisition by Group 42 and BGI of a mass testing laboratory (created on the basis of their laboratories for the detection of Huo-Yan emergencies in China).
This laboratory, which is deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCD tests per day and is the world ' s first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has taken advantage of the German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitation Epidemiological Centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreaks in China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, had not been able to provide enough medical kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronary virus.
The Government of South Korea has worked for several years to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many US private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded and stocks of lubricants and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits in March 2020.
The US test kits developed by the CDC had “disadvantages” and for this reason the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented the private development of the tests. Spain acquired testing kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found that the results of these tests were incorrect.
The company explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results could be failure to remove the samples or misuse of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the misrepresentation kits and replace them with other sets — Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic acquired in China had failed. 1.2 million testing kits acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they should be thrown to the Danube. Atesh Kara, a Turkish Ministry of Health official, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had “high error rates” and the Ministry “did not use them”. Britain had purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these sets were inappropriate for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses have had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of the people who have been contacted by such patients have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vo, where the first person to die in Italy from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of approximately ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of disease were quarantined.
The entry into the territory of the inhabited area was closed, and this measure completely halted the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine of the 2020 coronary pandemic in Singapore, there was much less tension than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose extreme restrictions on the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled there, and Singapore began urging residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools that had completed their holidays on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but restrictions were less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries had been able to identify more patients with poor symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next chart, the column “positive results” depends on the testing policy adopted in a given country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive impact than the country in which all citizens are tested, irrespective of the presence of virus symptoms, under other equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as “hand hygiene”, is a process of hand cleaning to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal and oral transmission.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or ordinary cold, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose or lips (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day to wash hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby’s berries or changing the diapers, before feeding the child, before food, and before and after preparation of food or treatment of raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with the aid of evil. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child going to the bathroom.
After dark, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The medical hygiene of the hands is related to the hygiene of medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing disease) as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and reduces the rate of infant mortality in the home.
The 2013 study showed that better washing of hands could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand-washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of low-income regions of clean water.
A 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea cases may be associated with washing hands with soap, washing hands with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (PRDs), provided appropriate habits are developed in each house, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the ORI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which kills about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill almost 3.5 million children annually.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after meals, which has become a strong habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the death toll on diarrhea by almost half and the death toll from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
The washing of hands is usually combined with other sanitation activities under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent washing of hands is that it can lead to drying of the skin and therefore damage to it.
The 2012 Danish study showed that excessive washing of hands can lead to the tinnitus and cremation of the skin — a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing may also be considered an symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (R & D).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (wetting, defecating), after washing the baby’s berries (sofabundants), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or bird.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or snorkeling, after touching the wastes of animal origin or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, washing hands with soap is relatively limited.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 revealed that on average 38.7 per cent of families wash their hands with soap is generally accepted. The 2014 study showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US list is closer to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest figure was recorded in China 23 per cent. There are currently several methods of changing behaviour and developing soap-washing practices in critical situations. In developing countries, school-teacher group washing is one of the methodologies that helps train children to do so.
The Emergency Health Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to promote child health and raise the level of education of children.
The national programme is based on degemintization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if soap or washing agents are added to the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and improve its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of cleansing the skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the process of purification.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on each cover of solid soap-contaminated bacteria suggest that this is unlikely, since bacteria are washed with foam.
The CLC still claims that “a liquid soap with a manual dispenser is a preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has selective effects on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics of their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosate, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may be inadequate.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection agents, complex compounds may contain acids (successful, ascorbic, milky) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other exhausts (aloe faith, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands, simple types of soap are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water that's comfortable for human skin is still hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a means of hand sanitizers that do not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as hand disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickening agents, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, which provides comfort in the use of these substances and reduces the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing at least 60-95 per cent of the alcohol effectively destroy the microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug-sustainable bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis rods, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent of the alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of the bacteria (the 3.5-decibel reduction log) in hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent of the bacteria (the 4-5 reduction log) in hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and are less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norviral (or Norwalk) viruses of the type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptics or alcohol-containing agents must be used to thoroughly process and nourish the skin of both sides.
The face and back surface of both ladens, as well as the space between the fingers, shall be wiped out throughout the length of approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly washed, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash hands instead of using disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for complete washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand sanitizers on an alcohol-based basis may result in dry skin if their composition does not contain sweeteners and/or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerine and/or other sweetening substances to the compound.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing mitigating components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobials.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dot syndrome or alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The less likely occurrence of irritable contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse their hands from organic substances but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as soap and water, since pathogens are still in the hands of pathogens.
The effectiveness of the non-spirt disinfectant depends to a large extent on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or spirit-containing substances.
Recently, it has been shown that the substances that use benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive side-effects.
Many in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with evil or clay.
Gold or clay can be more effective than water, but it will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or gold are contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, the zola is a disinfectant, as it forms a tap solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of gold or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the US Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing techniques, including the following stages:
Fold your hands under warm or cold water.
It is recommended that running water be contaminated because standing water can be contaminated, and the water temperature is irrelevant.
Wash your hands with a large amount of soap, including the back of the ladens, as well as areas between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap (and not just one water).
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you keep your hands, the more germs are removed.
Gently loosen your hands under the water.
Fevering your hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and most often people leave areas such as large fingers, wrists, areas between their fingers and fingernails unattended.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that moisturizing lotion be used to prevent drying of hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many inexpensive ways of washing hands: pouring water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and (or) using zola, if necessary, for example, in developing countries; there are water-saving solutions in places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), such as foot pedal cranes and other low-cost options.
A tap with a foot pedal is a simple structure consisting of a roped container and a knife lever that should be pressed to pour water onto the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than hand dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper napkins and towels; the study compared the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern hand-flow air dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers increased by 194 per cent and the total number of bacteria on the ladens increased by 254 per cent.
It has also been found that after washing and drying the hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers increases by 42 per cent and on the ladens by 15 per cent.
After washing and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers is on average reduced to 76 per cent and in ladens to 77 per cent. Scientists have also tested the possibility of cross-infection of several toilet visitors and the middle of the toilet in each type of dry land.
The air dryer, which emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), is capable of blowing micro-organisms off its hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other toilet users and sanusl within a range of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air distributes microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 metres of the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the dry hand method:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper towels.
The cleaning of hands using disinfectant napkins may be an alternative during travel in the absence of soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent of the alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignatz Zemmelweiss found it highly effective (in 1846) in preventing disease under fixed conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical washing of hands takes at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other with their fingers crossed.
If there is dirt under the nails, the brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in hand, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the crane and, if necessary, to close and open any doors.
This avoids repeated hand pollution from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogens (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand-washing and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catheter-related infections by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet with a picture of the standard hand-washing and handling procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The relevant review was carried out by Whitby in co-sponsorship.
If compliance with regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices may be used to measure hand hygiene and performance.
The World Health Organization denotes “five points” when it is necessary to wash hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
before use of antiseptics, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing (medical) or “antimicrobial” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in an environment with high levels of antibiotics-resistant organisms. To “clean” hands before surgery requires a crane that can be turned on and off without touching hands; some chlorohexidine or iodine water should also be used for hand polishing, sterile hand towels for drying after washing, sterile friction brush and other sterile fingernail cleaning tools.
All the decorations have to be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and elbows usually for 2-6 minutes.
There's no need to shake hands too long, like 10 minutes.
During stripping, the water from the forearm should not fall back on the wrists of the hands.
After the washing is finished, the hands dry with sterile tissue and put on a surgical robe.
In order to reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics before and after the treatment of a sick person.
To combat staphococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing was the most beneficial and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the washing of hands was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with the washing of antibacterial soap, washing your hands with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A comparison of hand-contained antibacterial soap and hand-washing, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with a spirit solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in reducing the amount of A H1N1 influenza virus and the Clostridium difficile dispute; hand hygiene activities in health facilities may include hand washing training, increased availability of spirit-containing solutions for hands, and written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash hands.
Further research is required on the most effective types of measures in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or washing equipment in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to practice regular washing of hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of hand-washing with soap can affect political solutions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based sanitation was less effective to improve the health situation in lower middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns were less effective; an example of school handwashing was the approach of the Children's Fund of the United Nations Three Star Approach: it promoted simple economic measures in schools that stimulate the washing of hands by soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring minimum standards, schools can raise their levels from one to three stars.
The installation of handcuffs is one of the possible measures in the context of hand hygiene information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronary pandemic, the United Nations Children’s Fund promotes the use of handwashing emodies.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs indicator (preserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating handwashing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two health innovators: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse and a “founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, owing to outbreaks of food tract diseases and health-related infections, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “right handwashing techniques” were hung in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “wash your hands” means that you refuse to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in deciding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; it was later used more widely in some English communities.
In the song “Macbeth” Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth is inadvertently washing her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain that symbolizes a guilty conscience in connection with the crimes she has committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act tended to wash their hands more frequently than others, and that handcuffs were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after what has been seen will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, handwashing is both a hygienic goal and a symbolic meaning: symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha’ahism, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netillat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam, and religions also prescribe a hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe compulsory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
The control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the use of methods for occupational safety and health care to control the risk and control of the coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper monitoring of risks in the workplace depends on the place and the job, is based on risk assessment, the severity of the community epidemic and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were needed to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of illness, compliance with respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but are likely to be infected with current disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers who are in contact with the public, such as schools, a high-density working environment and some major retail shops.
Risk management measures for such a group, in addition to basic prevention measures, include high-efficiency air filters, shields and accessible personal protection in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and mortuary staff who have contacted a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection of COVID-19 are at high risk; the risk is increased to a very high level in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol education or in the collection/processing of human samples with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk-control measures appropriate to such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The outbreak of COVID-19 may have various effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be available at work due to their own illness, the need to care for other persons or the fear of possible contamination.
Commercial templates may vary for both the types of goods for which there is demand and the means of purchase of such goods (e.g. purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance, without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Preparedness for the Epidemic and Response can be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address risks related to different jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from homes and communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as older age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of monitoring necessary to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
The preparedness and response plans may be in line with the recommendations of the national or state level.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health problems, maintain business operations and minimize the negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are influenced by the severity of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used to ensure safety and health at work to group such funds according to efficiency.
If the risk of COPID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective means of engineering and technical safety are then the administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
Engineering means that staff members are excluded from work-related risk areas and are not relying on the employee ' s behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures include changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from a worker or a staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but it may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment shall be selected depending on the threat to the worker, shall be of a size (e.g. respirators), shall be used continuously and appropriately, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and shall be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that the lowest-risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all jobs, include frequent and thorough hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including close of the mouth with coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff members with acute respiratory disease remain at home until the end of the fever, lack of fever and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of radioactivity or other medications to treat symptoms, and prescribes that hospital policies be flexible, that staff be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member and that staff be aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed data or suspicion of infection of COVID-19 but are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of disease in society in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with the recent visits of such person to places of distribution of COVID-19.
Such categories include workers who have had contact with the public, for example in schools, a high-density working environment and some large retail shops; engineering and safety tools for such groups and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of customer service frames without getting out of the car. Administrative measures for such groups and groups of higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings for virtual communications, the establishment of alternate schedules, the cessation of non-critical visits to places of distribution of the COVID-19, the development of communication plans for the protection of informational needs of the environment, including a forum for responses to worrying workers, the provision of relevant training for workers at the risk of less than the workplace and protection measures, the training of workers who are required to use the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is ill on an airplane, appropriate safety measures such as the isolation of a sick person from other persons at a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask or the request of such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a cough or sneezing napkin.
Secondary crew members shall wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when confronted with physiological fluids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other disposable items used should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected, in cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, the safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-insulating and immediately informing the medical centre on board if there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person, in the case of schools and childcare institutions, the CDC recommends that a short-term closure be made for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of travel for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events such as exercise or chorus, food intake in cafeterias, increased distance between parties, adjustment of arrival and departure times, restriction of non-essential visits, use of separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of distribution in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, long-term school attendance measures may be considered; for law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, the direct risk to health is considered to be low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of infection of COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those prescribed to ambulance polters, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
When in close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their formed belts and crews before re-use by domestic air-cleaning or erasure, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of personal protective equipment used, as well as on the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and mortuary workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel who are in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Aerosol-related procedures include probes, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling by invasive methods.
Staff members at high-risk morgues include those working on the treatment of bodies of persons with confirmed disease or suspected infection of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such staff are performing autopsy, they are at very high risk; additional engineering and safety equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated premises for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including procedures associated with aerosol education.
In some health and mortuary facilities, special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated with the precautionary measures provided for the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to separated waiting zones, depending on the existence of suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective measures, OSHA recommends that respiratory agents be used for workers operating up to 6 feet in a distance with patients with confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for persons carrying out procedures associated with aerosol education.
In the United States, approved NISH respirators for a person with a N95 filter or a higher class filter should be used as part of an integrated written respiratory protection programme that sets out the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide better protection and comfort for the staff member. WHO does not recommend using special clothing, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not a physiological fluid.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for screening staff at the point of admission of patients.
WHO recommends that persons collecting samples from respiratory tracts from patients with COPID-19 or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol education wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the person, robe and gloves.
The N95 or FFP2 respirator should be used instead of a surgical mask in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In view of the lack of personal protection tools worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protection by using remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent environments, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protective devices necessary for a specific task, the prolonged use of the same respirator, without removing, in the case of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the chain of supply of personal protection and the recommendation not to use masks for non-symptoms.

COVER SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DECISIONS: CC0: Protected rights are not available
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interrelationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the capacity to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relations among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, phone calls and chats — a remarkable confirmation that fortunately we have wonderful people working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to address Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the efficiency of the sites, to pay our colleagues or to protect the safety of the communities.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever.
At that time, not only what we do but also how we do it is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together, starting with the week ahead.
Adjustments to our working order and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During our communication, we considered our ideas for the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
We expect it to take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the follow-up orders come in.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care for your relatives, get food or go to a doctor, your well - being is our number one priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
There is no need for a hospital sheet or a vacation: just inform your manager and help the command revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and staff at an hourly rate.
Each person will be paid according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce remarkable results, especially at such times.
Again, it's self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we can know what to expect and be able to adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
Such activities must always be supported.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (including others) are critical to work for which additional support may be required.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift the focus on support, which is essential to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Deceleration today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to catch up” after the pandemic has ended.
You will not need to work overtime to meet the time limit.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What's going on with the APP?
In order to meet the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, and with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
This extension allows for a significant reduction in the current planning and stress burden throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, communicate relevant information to representatives and teams on the next steps immediately after receiving the confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Status of office, risk and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used the antiviral solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules of caution using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Colombia (DC) is on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all the personnel in DC its rules relating to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in D.C. went completely into remote work, as instructed in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work far away know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If needed for longer sessions, consider breaking them into a course of several days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and forward the study material in advance.
By default, use video communication to facilitate communication and communication, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator — a person who will monitor questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the one responsible for taking notes (or joint observation).
If necessary, contact the E-mail Technical Support Service.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team examines the ergonomics manuals available in web browser format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out concerted grant activities and that no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow up with further guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
General sentiments in the global community are not only resentment at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief from mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take advantage of the opportunity to further share relevant information, to answer your questions and to spend time with each other.
We are in this situation together, and we are ready to help all we can.
At the same time, you can continue to receive information from such e-mails and other important information about COVID-19 from the Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries affected by the current situation.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, key workflows, information reporting problems or other assistance, please contact the CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a problem with confidentiality, please e-mail Brian Judan, director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a denial of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that we can continue to work to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create a space for important work to be done in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
In order for this to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families and to work with the greatest possible benefit as soon as such needs arise.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reduces the content of angiotensin-II and increases Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-end peptidase domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid.
ACE2 is a one-pass membrane of type I, and its fermentedly active domain falls on the surface of the cells of light and other tissues.
The non-cellular domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shadase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately drained with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most light cell alveolar type II, thin intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 iRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stratum, the hypothalamus and the stem of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE splits the hormone angiotensin I into a suspension angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, separates phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, orange, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grillin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for certain coronarys, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (a virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (a virus causing COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, the binding of S1 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and translation of both the virus and enzyme into the endosomal cells.
This entry process also requires the initialization of the S-protein protein by TMPRSS2 which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to the idea that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help to combat infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving ATP inhibitors who have been at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients at general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in therapy with acute lesions of the lungs and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the case of acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolisaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24 hours duration of exposure.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with intolerance to classical renin-angietin inhibitors ( RAS inhibitors) or for diseases with elevated angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Annexes COVID-19 are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in an epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronary pandemic, i.e. in identifying persons (“contacts”) who could contact an infected person.
In some regions, a number of annexes officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options for contacts tracking applications have been developed.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of the users of the annexes.
Softer options include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their integration efforts to support such applications through Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an annex that allows citizens to check whether they have been associated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, using an app called TraceTogether in Singapore.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transferred to the Government. Northern Macedonia launched the StopKorona! app, which works on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to register with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar annexes are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCvid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geosonization function to ensure that patients diagnosed with COPID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications, including false response and potential inefficiency in the application of only a small part of the population.
Taking into account concerns about the distribution of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their applications related to the coronary virus to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through applications related to the coronavirus; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronary pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring shall be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of countering the proliferation of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to load the application and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to location data also have great potential privacy problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that only use central servers for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only did the Government use this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but it also made information about the location of the public, which was possible due to significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that was introduced after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
The tracking of contacts that maintain confidentiality is a sustainable concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating at least in 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups have worked on confidential solutions such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized confidential tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identified personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform to maintain confidentiality in the collection and use of location or intersection data to track the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies presented in Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is SafeTrace, developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops confidentiality technologies, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to allow users to exchange confidential data on the location and state of health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols established a global TCN coalition aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of applications for tracking and warning, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that allows confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Development of tools to enable Governments to create official applications to monitor the movement of persons infected by the coronavirus, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of continuous monitoring, first introducing the system through the updating of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also known as re-profile, redirection, task change or therapeutic diversion) is a re-profile of the approved medicinal product to treat a disease or medical condition other than that originally prescribed in the development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and the transfer of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 protein susceptible drugs, each with several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral medicine against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papaya-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicansa, S-protein and ADF-ribofosphatase.
Hussein AA and the co-sponsors in their clinical study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity with the most similar approved preparations to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-COV-2 preparation, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four substances studied in the “Solidarity” clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Kuomo announced that the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with the emergency authorisation (EUA).
The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorised under the EUA as a pilot treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trials.
The CDC stated that “the mode of use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use a drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish study group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Uhan and Shenchen have shown that favirvir is “ambiguously effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenchen who took this drug received a negative result in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug received the disease for 11 days.
In Uhana, a study was conducted to monitor 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received favirvir and the other half of whom received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority reminded the public that the results showing the effectiveness of the drug were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks and would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Cinzo Abe informed Trump's administration that it was possible to purchase a drug, and the drug could be less effective in cases of disease.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or for pregnant women.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletra) antivirals concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been established”.
The drugs have been developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will be linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is criticizing the retraining of drugs specifically designed for HIV and AIDS treatment.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesire was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections, and later, Gilead scientists found that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro in relation to the multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that remdesire may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are currently being conducted, including two by Cleveland University Clinics; one by moderately ill patients and the other by patients with more severe forms.
There are currently three clinical trials for intravenous administration of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, azitromicin antibiotics began to be tested in New York State.
The Japan National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cycloesonide) Tajjin, an inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for use in the treatment of pre-symptom patients infected with a new coronary virus.
Phase II, the form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is tested in 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COPID-19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over were invited to the study, diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization.
Pregnant women, breast-feeding and not using effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants on the test in Italy.
Low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Drug Administration to publish recommendations on the use of the medicine.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April to study the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the retraining of approved antivirals developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for treatment with COPID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenvir: umifenvir was recommended for treatment with COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for use as treatment with COPID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts have been made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be obtained earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I safety studies.
The COPID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of this disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technology platforms for creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the phase I safety studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, Type 5 Adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional vaccines have been declared, but there is little publicly available information (presumably in the planning or development phase).
Phases I to II provide preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several sites with more accurate and effective dose determinations.
Phase III usually covers more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and side effects are monitored at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine candidates (confirmed early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in clinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a vaccine with molecular inhibition, which genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, announced the initiation of work on its own vaccine in order to start testing on humans in 2021.
The launch of vaccination projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the initiation of work on the establishment of their vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
OncoGen in Romania published on 8 February 2020 a document on the development of a vaccine on technology similar to the one used to vaccine against cancer neoantigen.
On 25 March, the head of the Research Institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the initiation of the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project was under way to develop a peptide vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate who could be protested against in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccination projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Command for Medical Research and Material Security, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Research Institute of the Army, Silver Spring, located in the western part of Maryland State, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
for the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for the clinical trials and clinical trials of phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that it would take at least one and a half years to develop the vaccine in an accelerated manner.
On 12 March 2020, Medico, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that they had developed a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory studies and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money” for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German Government had protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is an iRNA-based vaccine candidate; it is currently undergoing clinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, an Italian biotechnology company, Takis Biotech, announced that it would receive the results of clinical trials in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could begin to be tested in humans in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Disease Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the vaccine from COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland universities.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different animal vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a provision of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine-candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medico and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced that 192 million Canadian dollars would be allocated specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national “vaccination bank”, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronary outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, saying that “MNA introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be produced as a nasal spray.
DNA bacteriophags will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless viral particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputers with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages besides disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to control biosafety level 3 infection in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination of the provision of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
As of 2020, SARS has no medicines or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When the MERS began to spread, it was considered that the SARS study at the time could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine, which had undergone Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were in development, two (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one (MVA-MERS-S).
There was a conspiracy theory on social networks that claimed that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all and that the vaccine already existed from it.
Publications in social networks quoted some patients as claiming patents for the genetic sequences of other strains of the coronary virus, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from first symptoms to peak is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and polyorganism deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection have been reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly spread in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air during coughing, sneezing or conversation.
Although these drops are formed in the breath, they usually pose a threat by falling to the ground or on the surface, but they are not passed through the air at long distances.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then with their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most infected within the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread may be possible both prior to symptoms and at later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymerised chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasal spray.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of being ill and for those who care for them.
The recommendations for the use of health masks differ: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COPID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and restlessness.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty breathing, permanent pain or feeling tight in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty waking up, bruising of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical care should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, frowning, or sore throat, may be less common.
There are also various percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, rheumatism and diarrhoea.
Some cases of disease reported in China were initially evidenced by a feeling of tightness in the chest and frequent heartbeat.
In some cases, disease may progress as pneumonia develops, polyorganismal insufficiency, and eventually death occurs.
It's called an incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually between five and six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms start to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and not all patients are reported to have symptoms.
The role of such unsympathetic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data suggest that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with unsymptomable disease is currently unknown; it is only being studied; while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations regarding the virus were symptomatic.
China ' s National Health Commission has begun to include unsymptomatic cases in its daily report since 1 April; of the 166 cases of infection registered on that day, 130 (78 per cent) have been unsymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both wetness and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With a loud voice, there are more drops in the air than in the speech of normal loudness.
An open cough study in Singapore revealed that the drops could spread at a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has assumed that the transfer of particles of the virus by bio-erosol is still possible, and the testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the human room has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SPD), may lead to the dispersion of the exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can spread through feces, however, this risk is considered to be low; the virus is most contagious when people experience symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2 to 3 other people; the virus can survive on the surface for several hours to a few days.
In particular, it has been found that on the cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These indicators vary, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents, when properly used, have a quite useful effect on the control of infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and is able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five out of six patients had the first test showing the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient had the highest level of the virus in the blood on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome that was first detected by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in native coronaviruses.
When outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap that covers its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-COV.
The light is the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates the host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in light type II alveolar cells.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein, the “bread” (peplomer).
12 per cent of infected people in the Uhana hospital were diagnosed with acute myocardial injury, which is more common in severe forms of disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during progression of the disease, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of the body.
High incidence of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolism (25 per cent) were observed in patients in COVID-19 and could indicate adverse predictions.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropicality to ACE2-expressive epithelial airways, patients with severe COVID-19 experience systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, it was found that GM-CSF pathogens correlate T cells with the recruitment of inflammatory monoocytes that release IL-6 and severe light pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also detected at the autopsy.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymersane chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nasal spray, but a sample of nasal spray or wetness may also be used.
The results are usually ready over a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks and the results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as possible contamination in the past, have been under development but have not yet been widely disseminated.
China's experience with the results of the tests showed that they were only 60 to 70 per cent accurate.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnostic test to be approved at the end of this month.
Bilateral subpleural subpleural focal points for the type of parent glass with peripheral, asymmetric and aterior distribution are common symptoms at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of a boulevard bridge (long thickening of the barrier with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Key results of the autopsy pathological study:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, sealing and swelling of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
light form of pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, major atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multinuclear giant cell formation
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exsudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: organization of alveolar exsudates and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular decomposition (DVD); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include housekeeping, avoiding human places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, cover the mouth and nose on the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a quality hygiene procedure for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that tissue masks be used in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by people with an unsympathetic disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed, citizen movements are restricted and major public events have been cancelled.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
Since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are reduced to the peak of the epidemic known as “outlet”.
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hand pollution, as well as before and after darkening, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant containing at least 60 per cent of the alcohol content, but only where soap and water are not available, to regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These components use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for hand antiseptic treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected wear a normal medical mask.
Extra-corporal membrane oxidation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory insufficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet be respected.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, doctors of intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in free resources — IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of first-line symptoms, some health professionals recommend that paracetamol (acetamine) be chosen over ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities, in the conduct of procedures in which air-bath emissions may occur, such as intubation or dry hands.
CDC recommends placing additional measures in the air-hospital unit (AIIR) in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of individual protection equipment (SIDs) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective measures: protective robe, respiratory or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; of the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not according to instructions, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends that protective face screens be used or, at the very least, that masks be made on their own under domestic conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 currents are not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of light or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COPID-19 is currently under active study, with some evidence that intubations can be avoided by a nasal oxygen canal with intense air flow or two levels of positive air pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition is as effective as the IVL.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of light, if available, because this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal canal with intense air flow; the risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds are lacking per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in COVID-19 infection in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
One study in China showed that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in resuscitation.
The challenge of artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops at COVID-19, and oxygenation is becoming increasingly problematic.
IVL with air pressure and PKCM are required to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which may result in the development of pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high VAT may not be available.
Studies of potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antivirals are currently being tested.
Remdesire appears to be the most promising.
The development of new drugs may take up to 2021 years, but some of the test preparations have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antivirals can be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers are involved in tests of effectiveness and safety of potential treatments, and the FDA has granted temporary authorization to use convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where human life is at risk of serious or immediate danger.
Its use has not been subject to clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect “close contact” by means of observation data and thus determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Large data analysis collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor cell phone data from people allegedly infected by the Coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, Germany and the Robert Koh Institute were provided with aggregated data on the location of cell subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
The Regional Health Commissioner for Italy, Julio Galler, said that cell network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move around the territory.”
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with over 42,000 participants.
President Kersty Kalluyd of Estonia also called for creative solutions against the spread of the corona virus.
People may be stressed with quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or the fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people.”
The disease may occur in light form with minor or absent symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Patients with mild form of disease generally recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may require three to six weeks to treat.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there is no such data on COVID-19, and some people may be affected by light and cause pneumonia as a complication.
People with the most severe COVID-19 disease may rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganism deficiency.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous thrombolysis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
Thromboembolism abnormalities, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was observed in 4% of the group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to early-stage studies, the mean time from baseline to day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Commission of Health of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of postmortem samples of light indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes had viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance of the light was similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (RSD).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also have an impact on mortality.
Mortality estimates vary depending on the situation due to such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
A lack of effective calculation of cases in light form could lead to an overstatement of mortality rates.
Nevertheless, the fact that death occurs as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
Smokers developed severe symptoms of COVID-19 in general 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients were about 2.4 times more in need of intensive therapy or death than non-smokers, and concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics found that some patients who had recovered from the disease were mildly reduced by 20 to 30 per cent and their scans were damaged.
After recovery, this may also lead to “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovering from the virus were immune to it.
According to other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there have also been reports of cases where post-COVID-19 tests on the coronary virus were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an acute prolonged disease, not a re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, animal origin and infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
The study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, refers to 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease and are also affected by testing levels, the quality of health systems, treatment schemes used, from the beginning of outbreaks of the disease and population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO attributed emergency code code for ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the ratio of death to infection is the number of deaths divided into the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies from region to region, some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the disease-borne death rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a particular segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected in the presence of such antibodies.
At the outbreak centre in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 persons (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelette, the disease spread during the carnival celebration among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths of COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.04 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates differ between men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gender gap has only been reduced since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g., male hypertension at a younger age than that of women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID-19 occurred in men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are therefore more likely to be infected by women.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanam Gebreisus, explains: “CO” means “croon”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease” and “19” when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on names aimed at preventing stigmatization.
WHO further uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public reports.
And the disease, and the virus itself is commonly referred to as the “coronavirus”.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the “cronavirus” and the “Uhankian coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the term “sharp respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published.
Owing to the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials such as nose swabs, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it at the required time, then one of the local plants was redesigned and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fairy tales about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the Internet became widely disseminated.
Humans may be able to contaminate other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, herds and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medication for its treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims at assessing the treatment effect of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous SARS-CoV studies.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
The second strategy, the creation of a single vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of an S-shape protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine method).
The experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. The first clinical trial of four volunteers began in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-inflammatory strengthening has been identified as a potential problem in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Substances approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven trials, four of which were hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The retraining of antivirals is a large part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III remdesivir studies had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate preparations for the treatment of COPID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antivirals for the treatment of COPID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta, were also considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of remdesire.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients receiving remdesire as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials has already been conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used to treat malaria has been considered in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Ukhania Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also refer to interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the inhibition of SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxaned was recommended for in vivo in-depth study by demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that for SARS-CoV-2 to be penetrated by interaction with the ACE2 receptor, a beam of transmembrane protease of serum 2 (TMPRSS2) must be absorbed.
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.
Hypercytocinaemia may develop as a complication at late stages of severe COVID-19 form.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinaemia, as a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab has been included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug went to the 2nd phase of an unrandomized test at the national level in Italy, after receiving positive results from its use in patients with severe disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis of ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
An interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA in 2017 on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients recovering from COPID-19 to those in need is currently considered a non-vaccinative method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results have not been conclusive.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect that passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as anti-telosate cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of convalescent blood serums, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains antibodies to the virus, may be increased.
Coronary disease, high-response syndrome
Lee Wenleyan, a doctor at Uhanya Central Clinic, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
