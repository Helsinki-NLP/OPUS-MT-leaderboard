Eighty-two-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
The eighty - two - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the steps of the local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, and he adds: “He has finally begun to succeed. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eighty-five-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, named the judicial doctor's office.
San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is under way.
The brother of victim Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The talking restaurant Sons & Daughters said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss it very much," the speaker said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had spent the first night in hostels, but that recently “he had finally begun to prosper. ”
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to have an argument.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, it was a rough diamond that sparked every day," he said.

Czech roads invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, he has invested state-owned carriers in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The amounts for modernisation in each year, with the exception of 2012, are, however, gradually falling.
In the last six years, Czech roads have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A higher proportion of investments put the carrier in regional transport, where approximately 60 per cent of the money was directed, and 40 per cent of the company invested in the reconstruction of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units currently reaches 19 years.
Modernised older vehicles, however, are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of driving vehicles of ČD would increase by 10 years.
A little older are on average personal wagons whose average age at the start of modernization is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic sets made up of wagons and hauled by locomotives, however, have been gradually disappearing from Czech and global railways in recent years and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 decreased from 280 to 223 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars destroyed.
From investments planned in the vehicle park by the Czech Republic in the near future, it is possible, for example, to purchase 50 wagons for speed up to 200 km per hour, which the carrier plans to install on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic speed lines.
The contract consists of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless, they admit.
For the past quarter of the year the online journal Aktuálna.cz has been following the story of the billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristally interesting walk in the crowns of the trees, but also the Olympic park.
The highway administrators know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of similar ads all over the country, possibly thousands.
According to officials, there is a law on the blame, which prevents illegal mobile billboards from being removed immediately.
A complex bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office will be short on it.
Or just move the advertising a few meters and the official process has to start again.
Road and motorway directorship admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main move from České Budějovice to Lipno stands on our property by the state road advertising billboard black.
Even three months, however, officials were not enough to get rid of unauthorized portable constructions with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that he's standing right next to the car, in a 50-foot security zone where there's nothing to stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't handle a billboard because of a leaky law.
Maybe load it up and drive it away.
"We can't just afford that," says the speaker of the Directorate of Road and Highway Nina Ledvin, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of a billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Aktuálna.cz in detail in the spring, is not unique and shows a general problem that the state and authorities can not effectively and quickly solve.
In the southern Czech Republic alone, the editor counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules right next to or near the ticket.
Similarly, there are other lands.
"We have difficulty forcing the company to remove the binders," confirms the head of the transport department of the Czech-Budejo district office Jiří Klasa, whose colleagues are solving similar stories.
According to the class, it's a lax law that binds officials.
First, he has to call the owner of the billboard to put the ad away.
But chief companies are often unattainable or know a trick that has already been described in the past when the issue began to be more detailed: enough mobile stand with advertising to move a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising into the basket.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they look at it as a new device and we have to contact the owner again," explains Jiří Klasa.
The new law won't help.
A new law could bring about a change that would ban billboards on motorways from September next year and limit them on the roads of the 1st grade.
Critics point out that the rules for denying illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be relieved.
Companies can continue to make tens of hundreds of millions of crowns per year on leases.
For example, the billboard that attracts Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her very well: the Czech-Budderick Magistrate currently runs three administrations for black-built billboards.
The firm is threatened with a $30,000 fine in every management.
These are more ads that have been placed in the class I road protection zone without permission.
Management is not over yet, says Jaroslav Frost, head of the Czech-Buddjov transport department.
The advertisement that is currently interested, although not yet configured among these cases, will soon most likely come to them.
According to RSD spokesman Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, so the case would get to the regional desk and then probably the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard belongs to those suspicious companies that are unable to contact.
She's not taking over the post office, and the official headquarters on Žižkova was canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who celebrated a heated dispute with the head of the Czech brand Hyundai.
Fischer, whose area is leased by Comez Billboard and offered to advertisers, refused any connection in the past.
This spring, when RSD began to take an interest in advertising to Lipno, Fischer had officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the new company is reportedly based.
Not even from this address, of course, has anyone contacted the highway administrators to this day.
It's a waste of fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in residences are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ICHO and there was nothing to solve.
The executioner returned the case, the commercials went on, maybe elsewhere.
We are against similar companies and their business practices quite helpless.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting under the condition of maintaining anonymity one of the officials.
There is no law in this regard yet.
Currently.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the term for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also for regional and general policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't stop the fairly established impression that if something doesn't work, then the laws need to be changed.
Farmers collect less grain this year, but more rapes and poppy, estimate statistics.
The Czech Statistical Office estimates that the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7% lower than last year.
Nevertheless, this year's crop has exceeded the average in the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the beet harvest (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The crop harvest will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Farmers collect 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth decline against last year.
Last year's harvest of cereals was excessive.
This year's crop has exceeded the average in the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the higher one will be the harvest of rape and poppy this year.
Raspberries collect 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The estimated decrease in cereal production is due to both a decrease in hectare yield by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the area of the seed.
Farmers settled three percent less in this year's field.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers moved her to more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed at the drop, which drops to 6.04 tonnes.
About a fifth of the decline in statistics is expected in spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The reduction in crop yield is followed by a 15.2 percent reduction in seed areas, as well as a lower per hectare yield.
On the contrary, winter barley will be born by 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of grain will also grow.
The yield of rapes is estimated at 1,305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
In fact, the seed areas expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectare yield is going to be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rape crop exceeds a ten - year average of 13.3 percent, while the crop is about a third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's also a poppy field.
This year, the farmers moved him to 35,543 hectares.
Against 2008, when poppy in the Czech Republic grew on record 70,000 hectares, however, the field is half.
Thanks to the expansion of the seeds, this year’s poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise against last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hectare yield is going to be 6.1 percent lower.
Breaking cops accused two men of assault with a knife and a machete, and the court sent them into custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a man in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday with a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused him urinary and carnivorous injuries, which required hospital treatment and other treatment," police spokesman Marie Strbáková said.
Both apparent perpetrators were apprehended immediately after the attack by police officers.
The defendant filed a motion with the court to take them into custody, and the court gave him a hearing on Friday.
Both men are threatened with three to ten years in prison.
The police charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him urinary and carnage injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which occurred on Tuesday in the right afternoon in the Freedom class, the police reported.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomuk police spokesman Marie Strbáková informed.
A mass conflict between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After aggressive verbal discords, two attackers attacked with the help of a knife and a machete of a 35 - year - old man.
Although the man in question tried to escape, he was injured by both urinary and carnage injuries, which led to hospital treatment and other treatments, the police spokeswoman said.
During a confrontation that brought great attention to the city’s centre, which involved several police patrols and officers on the ground, it was family disputes.
The criminals of a four-and-a-half-year-old man from Slovakia and a seven-year-old man from Olomouc accused him of attempted serious injury to health and extermination.
The defendant filed a motion with the court to take them into custody, and on Friday the court complied with him, accompanied by a spokesman.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle by the attackers five years ago, and it happened only a few decades later, before the Varna discotheque in Riegro Street.
The police then said that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the company's guests who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two foreign invaders with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most vocal examples of an unused and empty house is the extensive building of the former IPP headquarters in the centre of the Sensitivity Square.
It was supposed to work like a hotel a long time ago.
But it's still nothing.
That you need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of the Václav Square there are several residential houses, which, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, are only empty and empty.
We selected properties in the center with the project Prazdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, they want the initiative

Clinton's wives made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars spent on Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is for their speeches.
Trump rejects his tax confession to publish.
US Democrats candidate Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, AP reported.
Most of Clinton's income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015 when Clinton launched her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husbands made a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a national and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income on taxes.
Trump, however, has a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish the tax return.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to secrecy around Trump's incomes, inter alia, in order to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP said.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower profit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Caine, who has been running for vice president in tandem with the former lady, has today published a report on his tax deductions over the past ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and made 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, the armor broke again.
The Islamists from Boko Haram defended a consistent vaccination and killed a doctor.
Cases of child defense have re-emerged in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared extraordinary vaccinations, as two children infected with this disease have been protected.
The vaccines brought in helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended the vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus orbited undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, a special vaccination of children against armour will begin because two children infected with this disease have been infected there.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children and another four million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly delivered child armor vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are operating.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus has been circulating undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from entering areas where children with armor were found on Thursday.
Both the disabled battalion came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
WHO section director responsible for the removal of the armory Michel Zaffran station BBC said that the vaccination in Nigeria will start next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Borno.
The area was not made available to international organisations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram in this part of the country was able to weaken significantly.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adevole admitted that new cases of armor are a major disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to report that the defence was eliminated next year.
WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease did not occur for two years, it did spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be expected.
In 2012, there were half of all cases of armour in Nigeria worldwide.
While it was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope František met with 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a gang of pimps.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope František met with 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were released from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the stories of fallen women for over an hour and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, the Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Frantisek visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it, the pope's spokesman said.
František often draws attention to the fates of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit jihadists' factories.
Without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
In the fight against radical Islam, France has the help of Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valles' government plans to make major changes in the functioning of the mosque and the education of the clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And the others will follow, the Minister of the Interior announced.
Over a hundred jihadists work in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Walls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding from stirring the mosque from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf of Persia.
Even so, preachers who can spread radicalism in France are allowed to go to the mosque.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," added the Prime Minister.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to achieving these goals.
It should function as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Islamic Foundation is now operating in the country, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The Foundation had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries financing their construction.
But the institutions soon affected internal strife and rivalry.
"It is a total failure," Walls observed recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, there was a debate about a new institution that would replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All hastened further terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that a new foundation would be established in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure funding to mix from domestic resources and also to supervise imams.
So far it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on Halal foods.
In practice, the sellers would pay for the food, including certification.
Part of that money would then travel right into the foundation's register.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, about 30,000 of them travel to Saudi Arabia for a traditional pilgrimage.
And it's not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who went through special educational programs at French universities should be present in the mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching work is in harmony with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is on the move against the radicals.
And others will follow, the Minister of the Interior recently announced.
In France there is no place for those who in the mosques declare hatred and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are estimated 2,500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have evicted about 80 imams and are considering this for several more decades.
Not everyone, however, thinks that the government's actions can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people radicalize on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Drago Kelemen lost in the 1st round of sprint with the star Baugem.
The procedure for the eight-final must be combated by a Czech roadcyclist in repairs.
Drag cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after a procedure of qualification of sprint among the best eighteen, lost in the 1st round a match with the French great Gregory Bauge, defender of silver from previous games in London.
The procedure for the eight-final must be combated in repairs.
At the start of the royal discipline, 27 riders were built on the road and the best Czech driver of the present took the 14th best time.
He got a two-way with a flight start in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected in the qualification of the fifth Baugé, who already has the Rio bronze in team sprint.
Although Kelemen finally made it to an experienced Frenchman, he followed the procedure.
The gold defender Jason Kenny flashed with great performance.
Eighty-three-year-old Brit took the third fastest two-track history and won the qualifications in the Olympic record of 9,551.
It was easy, then, to cope with the last progressive German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful in its composition with Bradley Wiggins, who took the new world record 3:50,570 and entered the final four-km race.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which the British had four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
Young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full advice on supporting other field events in early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issue of the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the agreement with BMA.
58 % of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government remained "still silent" on issues, which was a big decision to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive body of the JDC decided by vote to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all matters. ”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing programme of events in the field from early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to declare six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The leader of the young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawian, resigned after deciding to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean a burden for the medical profession in England.
Russia and Turkey: Association of "Incomparables"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of the long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the prideful palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There's been a hand-to-hand application, yes.
But Putin didn't smile and barely radiate his heat, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Tayip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “Dear Friend” to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: The shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was fierce back then.
Putin was handing out wounds around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The deterioration was greater than the loss of an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media led a massive, comprehensive campaign against Ankara after months.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious was the accusation from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official message that it was time to move on.
After all, it was only because Putin received the apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared any victory you had.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring the truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost relieved of power last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also apparently shaken it.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - notably the cancellation of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists on the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take a breather when flights are restored.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey was again allowed.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” the news reported in the Vesdom newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers to be a weak reaction to an attempted coup.
In addition, the long-standing hatred of long-term EU entry and entry talks Putin is eager to use the cold to break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is given.
So the summit in this pompous, maritime palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to present what one of the analysts described as “a union of incompatibles”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West connect.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that, after nearly three hours of introductory talks, the two presidents at the press conference said that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish President deliberately answered the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two states could find a common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a total disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shoots down a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s executive director, the RBS brand is to be pushed back into the role of office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
She was hunting when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, strategic brands used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
She was behind millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations football championship to Winbledom's Winbledom champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national stamps.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but it will not start new shops.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered our questions Ross McEwan.
The BBC station in Scotland said: “The RBS brand will no longer be our investment brand and the brand that our employees work for, because we are now becoming much more brand banks. ”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand as well as RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have domestic efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, prepared a profile of individual brands of sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to move to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the executive director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But together with how we focused on customer needs and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these brands again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horse predilection led to goal 3000. winner
Dettors sprays champagne after winning double in New Market brought him 3,000 victories
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in Britain in New Market on Friday.
This milestone reached his second victory in the evening on his local track - on the horse Prediction trained by John Gosden.
Fifty-four-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this in the straight range.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of the Dettori Jack, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: “It’s strange. ”
I'm very impressed, because my family is here too.
I'm extremely glad it happened in New Market, because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predition after victory
The two jockeys of this milestone have reached obstacles – Richard Johnson's champion jockey and Sir Anthony McCoy's 20-time pension champion, who, during his career, broke records, has scored more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, derby's nine-time winner, 4 493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fistron that distinguishes it from other riders in the grave.
He's a fantastic race ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he wasn't just driving on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's alive, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From summer finishes to summer jumps - Frankie Dettori was a messenger of the British straight race for two decades.
It was like riding a mountain road.
An overwhelming number of big race winners, including his famous “great seven” in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he was staggered for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban, but demonstrated incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin fired President Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov of the post of Chief of the Presidential Office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest associates for many years.
Twenty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin “released Ivanov from his service the head of the Russian presidential office, ” but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Four-forty-year-old Vano was a diplomat before.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
On his appointment to Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the head of state within the meaning of the draft laws and the control of the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from office and recommended that he replace it with Vine.
Convincing smiles?
This step has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time, and he worked for the KGB as well as Putin.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcasts state television, both men announced that he was leaving the post of president's office at his own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some kind of struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought of as a possible president suddenly wanted to lead Russia’s environmental policy was met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin quoted Putin as saying: “It is true that in 2012, I asked you to give me this very challenging post, even a problem post, for four years.
Apparently, I was head of the Presidential Office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
He had previously held the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and formerly, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came into power, he appointed John as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, it even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin to the state after his second election period, because the third period would be against the constitution for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister only three and a half years later before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, star of the Criminal Thought series, was released after hitting the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The TV stations ABC and the CBSs that produce the series announced in a joint release declaration.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before the announcement.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
According to BBC and CBS TV stations, the details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the show that's watching the stories of the FBI's team are a little later.
The four-and-a-half-year-old actor, who was celebrated in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has been active since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and over the last 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in a statement he made Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it all the way, but that's not gonna be possible right now.
I'd like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
Back to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In Banff they mysteriously landed in the fish garden
A man from Banff City asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eel left there by a water clot.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his finding on the Periscope Channel in the belief that someone could help him explain how about five - inch [5 cm] of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viadukt - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So it is the first of the four “plyholes ” that are now almost complete around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife Bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we have all witnessed how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge in an impressive measure.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge surface of the delicate operation required extraordinary precision.
In its place there is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now pouring out in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first lock on each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the earth’s construction industry.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approaching viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up by about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything was going very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are “happy to be alive ” after being flushed by water from their fishing boat near England.
Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station issued an alarm Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw an incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unruly.
“We saw their boat circling near them and we thought of the worst,” said the rescue boat driver Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind fortunately drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted, holding on to a fight.
They were all taken aboard a coastline rescue boat and taken back to the rescue boats station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had an emergency shut-off line, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when there was a coup.
Someone was holding a protective hand over those boys upstairs.
The judge refuses to solve the case for Tuchor's wife.
Peter Tluchoř is one of the three members who were charged with receiving from Prime Minister Neča and his then head of cabinet Jan Nagy's political hit, that is, a lucrative post for a political retreat.
In 2012 it was the approval of the tax package.
Schneider, Fuksa and Tuchor gave him their resignations.
Then they showed up at influential positions in state-owned companies.
And that's why they also faced suspicions of bribes and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, but unjustifiablely, and they received a total of nearly 2 million crowns.
The deaf man is now in the cause as a witness after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courtroom on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
However, she wants to be careful (resolve criminal matters - see order.) and prevent possible objections.
The case is likely to be taken over by another Prague court district.
The Queen has already absolved Jana Necova twice before Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track down the first wife of Prime Minister Nesto Radka.
In this case, the Thug didn't set up.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way that the court is ruled out if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge at that time, he mentioned for the diary.
"I think it's cute," he added.
Roman Boček, former official, is also charged with political strikes.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 held a case against the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Neča Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other accused of misappropriation of the Military Intelligence.
There's a shot of her coming to court with her husband.
She's supposed to be talking about Perutko.
For example, the ambassador's wife was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Perutko.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air strike by the Allied forces.
She and two of her old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
The young London women who fled from their homes were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abbase, and Kadiza Sultana went according to the media to their other former classmate at the Bethnal Green Academy of London.
Last year's case caused a huge wave of attention and also tension in the relationship between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims, some 50 young women and girls, have traveled to Syria so far.
A number of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
A great job you don't even need a college job for.
That's what it looks like to be an I.T.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on the Czech ratios of extremely high wages (you will earn up to 180,000 CZK in Prague) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most wanted are personnel agency Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
They are therefore not competing with job candidates, but with job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't necessary.
Higher education is not a necessity for aitarians.
Higher education means a good basis and is a general indicator of the intellectual and educational capacity of the candidate, but often does not have much in common with knowledge of development.
The developers have to learn new things all the time, which is not going to be replaced by a graduate college, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
It's made the most in Prague.
Paybacks everywhere move high above the republican average.
For the most money they will come to Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirmed.
The highest profits will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to CZK 120 000 - 180,000.
In other regions, wages are lower, but they do not fall below CZK 80 000.
The IT project managers are also asked.
On arrival, they can earn CZK 60,000 - 100,000.
It's about graduates, too.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, it doesn't work for the A.I.s.
If companies are to be dragged and overpaid by an expert from another company, they like to reach out to a graduate.
They can raise him according to their own standards.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but it is necessary for the Ayatians to have at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are confronted with a number of cases where companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person in particular and will only be satisfied with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign speeches, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he adds.
Yeah, in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly can Czech employees envy Google employees.
Of course, it is easy working time for them, working from home, or a variety of shorter obligations, not just for moms.
"The new father provides the company with four weeks extra leave after the baby is born," says Martina Joneková, a Google speaker.
Hiccup also provides health care for employees and family, eating, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to be educated has a green one, and it doesn't matter what new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator for free is also definitely not to be thrown out.
A healthy lunch (in some locations and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called micro-kitchens, where people always find healthy snacks, the speaker announces.
And so that nothing has to be thrown out, so that he can't eat, he can put in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these for the Czech proportions of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker adds.
The United Nations has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights for the criminalization of refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "causes serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law", said Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He noted that "he is particularly concerned to witness how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for criminal armed fighters who are holding a race for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who switch to Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And what's worse - they're often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including his or her own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, a number of people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from the couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens initially crashed on TV, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technologies and activities outside don't exclude each other.
I am speaking of course of fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on art that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later there was a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The entry in other countries was then postponed due to the strong interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokemon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone go out looking for Pokemons who watch with GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" them (via screenshot on the phone) or "capture".
Mania admired the generation that at a younger age played the game, raised her from the seats and drove her out looking for Pokémons.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that an “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram application for smart Apple watches, which monitors 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of starting the game, the number of people who were watched every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who Pokemon Go is playing - only sees rough data about levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking to "find 30", "get out of the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen to unproductive ground, because most of the messages aimed at public health are boring and designed for people who do not look well.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, which we cannot fully mention here.
But the beauty of the Pokemon Go game lies in people going out and doing something that entertains them.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight, and fun.
Some people even make new friends in the pursuit of pokemons.
As is the case, there are, of course, such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come in the door.
What, like what?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, applications for smart phones, such as Fitbit, were able to monitor our activity, but they gave us no reason to do anything like this game.
The news is looking and the interest in it is beginning to decline at some point.
But thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Beales won gold in a multi-fight of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Billes is immune to all of this.
Dynamic at the jump.
No effort on the well.
They all fainted in the simplest.
Excellent at everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday for a multi-fight title, and the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlights overcame.
Overall result 62,198 clearly confirmed its lead in front of the silver medalist and member of the team "final five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafa.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during a performance in the finals of the Multi-Fighting Individuals in Sports Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Billes became the fourth American in a row to win more fights, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best at all.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of single athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Billes has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals at world championships - including 10 golds. Her amazing compositions are a mixture of ambition and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she has ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Billes and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Billes (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hugging after winning the gold and silver medal in the final female multi-fight single at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
First Billes won Tuesday, when she was as an exclamation point for Martha Karolia's outgoing national team coordinator.
Billes insists that during her long journey to the top she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of its simple composition - the one that contains a typical triple flip-salt for it - is placed in Latin music that would just be suitable for home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and where she gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a trail of victory that can continue as long as Billes wants.
Even though Mustafa took the lead for a short time because of the two turns, it was just an illusion.
The stable and the simple - where Billes defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to her forehead with 15,433 points behind the hammer - and ended up with 15,933 points in the blanks.
Raisman hugged her gently when she was waiting for the final score - a mere formality - and around the lustrous red, white and blue shadows, the Beales appeared tears when the wish was fulfilled, which she had once written in her diary as a little girl.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third line with Mustafa, but then she had the bronze for the sum of the three best compositions.
This time, the twenty - two - year - old captain of the team that the Americans call "grandmother" was far ahead.
After her simplest, she sent out a crowd of air-kissing men who were overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Billes, this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the serial killer case were shot listening to music in the car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most important attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot on June 12th in a car parked on the driveway.
According to the report, an armed man stood on the passenger side and fired eight gunshot wounds from a handgun, then escaped in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth a triple homicide, because the attacker didn't take the wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims had on him.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Spanish quarters, there were nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s in the villa area in front of the houses,” Howard said earlier this month for KPHO station CBS.
Police believe that the suspect used several cars, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was transferred to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died instantly.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty delivery just half an hour before the triple homicide.
Investigators found the shells, and from the remains of the bullets in the seat, they built a bullet from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is absolutely not true - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, have learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a facility.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't even crawl, and he's still not talking.
Some limiters are already slowly filling up.
He goes out with help and rides a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents the sign language that Edmund uses to say, “Please sing to me. ”
“We teach him sign language,” Picciut said for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can come from a number of different states: genetics, such as Edmund's, and infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as dormitories or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too soon to tell us what effect the Zeka virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut reminds us of an emotional tax that the uncertain future chooses.
I keep asking, "What happens next?"
What's next?
And he's still not sure.
In fact, I never really asked what the overall forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
But Picciut has an encouraging report for the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Just know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods called for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and extensive floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has announced that after extreme rains, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in the south Mississippi are pouring out of their shores and are threatened by massive floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were getting applications for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tangipahoa district asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood patrols will stay in most southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated in a statement that more than 8 to 13 centimeters may rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on standby on Friday, when the rain continued in the city of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite have a culmination at Denham Springs on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alec Krautmann said they both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the dangers are the floods after the Ascension district, when these watered currents will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded levels on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
The paramedics are still picking up people from the rushes in Amite and Wilkinson County, southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were already on Friday among the saved at Gloucester's.
Hansford, 62, said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was warned by his next stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
We had it all the way to the passport.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced in a river in 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to the fire station in Gloucester, where they stayed hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that floods “swiftly spread ” and authorities consider evacuation with the continuation of significant rains.
According to Krautmann, the observer reported that between midnight and Friday morning, 35 centimeters of rain fell.
Krautmann said the soil is sorely wet from Wednesday.
The authorities stated that the rains and paid travels required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of their education in five school districts.
According to an elder from Tangipahoa, the WWL station reported that 200 homes had been flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been imprisoned by high water.
In Amite and Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In Tangipahoa district in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and local residents received sandbags that could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last great floods were here in March," said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, crisis manager in Harrison County in Mississippi state, said that steady rain continues on the Gulf Coast.
He said a couple of homes had been flooded on Thursday, but none of them showed up on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amita, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - “The Boy Shot as Solved” survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's a second shooting at a kid 6 years old in the city.
The grandparents of the child identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahai Brown.
The grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He caught it terribly much, his little body was shot as solved," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family for the station said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahay Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stable condition.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a ninety-five-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that there was likely a shooting between several armed men.
There were shells from a weapon of attack that belonged to a variety of assault weapons.
It was certainly a continuing battle, apparently.
There were shells on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
It therefore seems that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," the commander of the Philadelphia police, Anthony Ginaldi, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one's been arrested, and the police are reportedly investigating the video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old kid, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's exactly how I picture the women's gymnast team for this year's Olympics, for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Billes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and by Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the peak of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second lines last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals was surprisingly the champion of the Olympics, and America was shining.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the triple world winner Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented the unexpected but master gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in women's multiple fights.
And Aly Raisman's team member won the silver.
We're witnesses to a sports summit, but in gymnastics class in the country, it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same route to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are a “final five” because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympic game will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Martha Karolyi trains.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnastics practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which support parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their confidants and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Beales, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring training to gymnastics that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It's this team's inspiration that will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for having demonstrated “girl power” and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to embark on the road to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
The ministers hoped that the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the differences over the changes after the renegotiated contract, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election refused the contract.
Hunt discovered in July plans to force the contract that NHS was in “nobody’s land” and that further delay would have a detrimental effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend working procedures to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Commission for Young Doctors, stated in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and thus fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters into a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation met with reluctance to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push on coercion and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, there were nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits because nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the renegotiated contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strikes.
Mortimer said: “Only a little or nothing will be achieved in the field, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services, and fear, exhaustion, and disruption for patients, caregivers, and their families will rise. ”
Over the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health and others we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as burden, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and pay gap between sexes - was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health made agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The cure for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend that it be given more to patients for a longer time.
The medicine against blood clotting Ticagrelor reduces the risk of relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people will suffer a heart attack every year, and another quarter of them will suffer another heart attack or stroke.
A heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a related layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is to be severed, blood clots may occur, blocking blood access to the heart, and a heart attack.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream may continue, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of further seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the business name Brilique, reduces the risk that clots occur less likely.
The proposal for a NICE directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
It has been shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
It is our pleasure to expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, treatment over this time is not recommended in the proposal.
Computer culture has begun to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlet Mayor Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of the widespread frauds in Muslim communities, says the government report today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, electoral inspectors and councillors for ignoring voter abuse because of their “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion”.
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that the intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that the police should protect cordons and wary voters from the polls.
He recommended that voters take with them identity cards and be able to prove who they are in the election.
At present, the electorate is just to give his name and address.
The report further suggests that people's fingers should be applied to unpaintable ink when giving away their voice in order to prevent a person from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press have more access to documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only protection against election fraud, it is also protection of the local government against the wider corruption environment and the financial frauds that go hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a consequence of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets in western London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “cynically affected ” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said that he “kept his campaign so that the religious obligation of the Muslims was to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and is issued from someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondence vote - which the older members of the Muslim community claim to have exerted pressure on the people during it to vote for the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: “Proved that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were under pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"There have been concerns that... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and thus preventing "voting out".
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also asks for more detailed checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and tax fraud.
Consider asking the voters to submit an identity document before the vote.
Using an indelible ink on the fingers of a person in a vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Applications for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited for a period of three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating dedicated correspondence voices and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create a cordon around the election rooms.
To amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons who are under illegal pressure under the 1983 reform law.
No taking photos in the election rooms.
Require that only the English (except Wales) work in the election rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that employees adhere to the rule that voters go to the election booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it is “surprising” that no charges have been brought against them since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for Lithuanian corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty above reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
It also criticises the insurmountable ‘check of check boxes’ in the polling stations of the city council.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s ruling in the Tower Hamlet case was awakened.
Our nation has a proud reference to the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Crazy cycle double duchess Kate and other double celebrities at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotová, who is quite strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a four-twenty-year-old olympic isn't far from the only athlete trying to get gold this year, who can boast of his own doppelganger from a number of celebrities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic games in Rio and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the F EMAIL column has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: American archer team member Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCaprio.
Next to Kate's double on the cycling track a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCaprio.
Racer from the American archers' team Brady Ellison caused a Twitter storm after his pictures came out, which clearly resembled the Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard about his similarity with Leo since he was a kid.
"He sees no great resemblance, perhaps other than beards," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be even more stressed this year: the striking image between the British jumper Greg Rutherford and his favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafan, with her large, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the actor from the movie "Inception"
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same brown skin and the same blonde hair as Annalynne McCord's, and about Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, fans say he looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Good Women: Hope Sol (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that similarity was noticed by others
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Soccer star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really amazing face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerry Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's smile, or the gold medal holder for Gabby Douglas' gymnastics, proud of her wonderfully broad smile, which is like copying Gabrielle Union's smile, the star of Bravo, girls!
CBC Olympic Games Commentary apologizes for saying that the Chinese swimsuit was "exploded"
The viewers of the central live stream from the Olympic Games at the CBC Station have disrupted the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by Byron MacDonald. The swimmer ended up in the fourth women's race at 4x200 m free style relays.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was “drawing like a stench” and “exploded”.
Commenter Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the final women's staff at 4x200 meters free style began to croak his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was to bring “resurrection” to the CBC team of commentators, said, among other things:“ The little 14 - year - old from China gave up, you bastard. ”
Too much excitement, too much smell, exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second relay race at 1:57.79 – that is, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to reach China.
Audiences in Canada quickly started calling online and were appalled by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC speaker declare that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "exploded"????
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the 4x200m women's relay race final was described as: “The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you scum.”
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't stick back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted CBC broadcasts, apologized for McDonald’s lively comment and said: “We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimsuit that escaped the broadcast. ”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Companion Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and filed their apology in reply to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments of Commentator MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the radio and to those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimsuit's performance, not the swimsuit itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I meant the performance of a swimsuit and not the person of a swimsuit as such."
"There is no need to say that I did not intend any disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark are upset by a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of a store
When a woman undressed to try her panties in the middle of Primark, they were not shopping for certain to look at.
To make things worse, she tried to get her size down, take her panties off, and put them back in the rack.
She continued her tour and finally tried four pairs of panties in the shop at Bouverie Place in Flokestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where the woman tried her panties before she brought them back to the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said that a mysterious woman, after trying her underwear, “put on her new clothes and left the store without buying anything. ”
She said: “People could not believe their own eyes. ”
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She wasn't even trying to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, holding on like a monkey."
"Everybody was just staring at her panties again, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back in the rack."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like it, re-dressed and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching - not even thinking about the person who might be buying panties she was trying to buy."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleaned them.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that I had apparently tried to withdraw from the sale, which is also the only right thing to do. ”
"I would have imagined that I would bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, undressed them and that they were not washed."
“ Primark knows about the incident that took place at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend yourself against an attack by using the Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the Federation of Crav Magys based in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain advantage over the abuser, whether he approaches you from the front or the back.
If he approaches you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free shot course”.
Then you grab a gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit him in the face with a free elbow.
Then he follows his knee to the weak, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, punch him in the face and start to retreat, while holding the gun against him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the punk can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force into the weapon and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of its closing and start retreating, and still aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you're not the master Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Passenger Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a severe test of his immune system and strangulation reflex - by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and author of Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, licked the power of his immune system with his language of euro banknotes, fences on Piccadilly Circus, flush button on the toilet on the train and Russian public phone.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us all what he was going into.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals throughout his journey throughout Europe about strengthening the bacteria of the intestinal flora and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left nothing worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the resilience of his intestines on his journeys around the world and by eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public rails at train stations to a flusher
In a film he made about it, he says: “I haven’t taken much care of my health since I was a child, and I put everything I could into my mouth, from clay to eating worms and mud water. ”
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
All he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple eraser, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but to lick refused after what its luminometer showed over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a travel film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
He said in the film: “This is almost the ugliest thing I have ever felt in the toilet. ”
There's nothing dirtyer than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr Wright was given Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio’s company for refreshments, juices, and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would monitor the capture and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "call Ian."
It's said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is connected with the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have provided consumers with interesting information in more detail.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted — like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie.”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, and others were very difficult.
I'm glad we made some of those dirty things."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015, according to which 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with the health of the stomach and intestines and 58% of respondents indicated that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family who were socially needed before they moved destroyed the community building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needed people left £50,000 worth of damage to their community home after being charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved out of a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after many complaints against them.
After their forced removal from the house, the officials of the housing company were shocked to learn that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor coverings were torn, garbage rolled all over the floor, and the walls were muddy.
The family has already moved and is considered to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
We need to consider a number of circumstances, because this property is likely to come to mind as "not quite a nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are ungloriously known.
A couple had three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and police said that the horrors the family had had included street fighting using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, distribution of drugs and loud shouting, quarrels and bullying.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the lease agreement, was fined in June for antisocial conduct.
In several rooms in a house that might be demolished, smelling waste was found.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, there was a tearout of the floor cover
Neighbors say they saw them in the street fighting, and people called the police here regularly.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house violently this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relief neighbors welcomed the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: “They didn’t take care of anyone at all. ”
We've lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
The number of times we've seen the police here, it's impossible to count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family in the house lived for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were laid in the ingrown part of the community house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept responsibility for her own conduct and for the conduct of her family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who have informed us bravely.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bear the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving out
The workers will now have to dispose of the piles of waste left around the house
In 2014, she conducted police in a house of robbery and found over 70 grams of hemp, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was earmarked for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they'll be trying to move out tenants who violate the rules of their leases.
Angela Crowe of Dan and Cornwall Police said that the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who want to follow such behaviour," she said.
The police of Dan and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after a low flight of military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portuguese Aveir were terrified to death
The flight of Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew to an incredible low
The military air force said it was a drill flight, and it insisted that there was no security threat.
At a time when a low-flying jet sank over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
The dramatic footage shows how the military aircraft reaches almost the distance from the sun’s people on the sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being alarmed by the sound of jet engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
There was an incident yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who published videos of a dramatic crossing on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice as low and at one point it seemed to collapse. ”
Nuno Arroya adds: “I surfed and actually thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were appalled when a low - flying plane appeared out of darkness
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing vessels off the coast and had to be carried low because it was the only way to check the ships.
The aircraft reportedly flew something more than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the air force insists that the safety of the people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's military air force today announced that the pilot had to fly low due to heavy fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found out during the second quarter checks.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform the survivors of their prices or issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The Czech Republic has imposed 41 fines totalling CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, informed her of this.
The inspectors found doubt in 47 of the 95 controls.
In addition to notifying prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services have also sold products or provided services at other prices than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This was the case for urn packagings, covered in candles and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a breach of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, was reported to have died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnimee Akunjee said the family found out about her death in the Syrian Rakka weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air raid in Rakka, which is the home of a group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war of a narrow country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others - is that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that it will discourage people from ever making decisions," Akuñee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded the plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then took the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria and had been widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he'll leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Senate leader, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democrats Hillary Clinton, nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the event of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The majority Senate leader Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late judge of the highest court will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call Thursday, Reid said he believed that Clinton would choose Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokeswoman later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she'd nominated Garland and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "shut the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics blocking Garland's appointment are “ministers” and “jumpers” of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidential office.
He said Trump didn't fit the office.
According to the Treaty magazine, naked calendars are for “women and men”
The Treasures magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 70th edition of Pirelli.
But instead of exposed celebrities trying for their calendar 2017 NU You have to find another generation of top models.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity from Playboy from the old school is different, because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We have to go back to displaying timeless and classic nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the woman’s body,” Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys phonograph records?
Vinyl loves lonely men of middle age.
Before you decide to cover the comment section with peppery notes under the alias No All SingleMenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so much of the debated resurrection of phonograph boards is linked not to the boom of the millionaires who want to love the originality of the ownership of the physical subject, but to the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about gathering an excited fan - it's all about emotional dimension: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are youGov's results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television report, I would be watched by a camera, going to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decadent gray suit, and gesticulating. Then I would stop by, pull up my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look.
While his charm and charm are slowly being wasted from the heart of Soho - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, snacks and office supplies are now filled - several fantastic specialized stores with gramophone boards remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll stand close to the different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional disposition are.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I watch from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one middle-aged woman about 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and watches the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All of these recordings cut down the walls of his living room - in the picture above (the photo was sent by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because they can afford it: they can now buy phonograph records that they couldn't afford when they first came out, and they buy what they sold when they were young and didn't even have a windshield.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12 then I was too young and couldn't get them," she says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like society for themselves, and they add: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Take 25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback felt compelled to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their phonograph records and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their phonograph records back," he says.
That could explain the boom lovers of phonograph records of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of the record?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you'll find a nice community of people with a similar mind in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly affected by the non-contact payment system.
Some gramophone board promoters may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and opt for the familiar packaging environment of the gramophone boards, things that bring back memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" a coworker from a bunch of gramophone boards is called.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the enquired turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables don't have a record player.
At this point in the report, he must have seemed really worried about going through a bunch of compilation bosses nova.
The aspect of “trophy” and the resurgence of interest is something that Jonny (42) noticed working in Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on the radiohead board so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
It's not a large percentage of them, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a gramophone. ”
They're younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where currently almost one floor is reserved for gramophone boards, has many more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There's a couple of 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops used to be - the speakers call the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to estimate the insidious mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fopp and watches various turntables in discount.
He's one of those people who looks at the window rather than spend too much.
She doesn't make much money in her own words, so it doesn't count that she collects record records.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the gramophone boards have their magic... ," he sighs eagerly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a business that supposedly inspired a new generation of record-players: Urban Outfitters.
I appear to be very interested in the girl's fliers in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just convulsing around Polaroid cameras and then the father and his daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is the staircase, whose wall is covered by the recorders Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph records.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's purely a "vinyl trick".
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for the others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it spends the most on the most luxurious goods it is definitely.
But, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate - at least in record-board stores, they don't take into account a large number of vinyl collectors and fans who actually exist, in record-board stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the gramophone records store on Berwick Street, walking through recordings and avoiding sightseeing of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator, who hides behind the back of no-knowing middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrae - video reporting
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average life expectancy of all vertebrate species on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measures 5 metres.
The court in France refused to break up business in the jungle refugee camp
The Court in France rejected an order from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of commission shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircutting, and at commission restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic food for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations in court stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food, offered by the state-supported associations and other groups, does not provide an additional food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial commissions and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis that would prevent people from operating 72 commissions, but stated that the objections of Prefect Calais were “comprehensible”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants play a far greater role than simply serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions".
He said that the premises provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, operated by a nonprofit organization offering 200 meals, English and French classes and asylum advice for hundreds of endangered minors without escort in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the “children’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter stating that closing the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of them only eight years old. ”
The Charitative Organisation Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after the steep increase in arrivals during the summer has increased to more than 9,000 - which is still the most ever.
He thought he was dead.
The street is baptizing itself and the volleyball Ústí.
"Since March I have been able to practice normally," he reported at the start of summer training in full strength.
What's wrong with you?
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood issues.
So it caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my elbow for two years, and I didn't know it.
It hurt, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a broken vein in the fly, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's moving or changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
I didn't know I had an embolism last year at a summer tournament in Wooden Mountains, and I couldn't move at all.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was dead for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden, even my friend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I've got some blood issues. I need to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
It was only when I wanted to return to preparation with the Pribrams last year that there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it off. I'm physically better at it than I was before.
What do you expect from Ustí?
I'm glad the party looks good, most of the guys I know.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we'll sit down humanly to get it together.
Will you pick up Ustí?
She had a reputation as a thug, but every season is different.
Brno was the eighth two years ago, and now it's the second.
There's a new team in Ustí, only a few players left.
It was the last of the extras, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
If we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who's going to be the thug after the first round, we don't.
Is it a guarantee of success, Coach Brom?
He's already experienced and he's been through a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my coming didn't have to do with him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, and I'm a big friend of mine, and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's trained for many decades, he's an ex-good player.
He's gonna move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-special team.
I've been in Pribramy for two years, but Ustí is more of a challenge than being on the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned strangers, he's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, at the university we played against each other in a group.
And we had a couple of times together, and sometimes we sat together after the fights, so we already know each other friendlyly.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately poured it on the start of summer preparation in Ustí.
She's got a slovak girlfriend, she's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze will be here soon.
Do you know anything about them?
I was writing with an American. He looks like a nice guy. A Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact an American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so whoever's forming, I should be communicating with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, I found him online playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some news on Facebook, he seemed like a joke, he'd fit in with us.
How do you look forward to being a recorder?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be twenty-four, and I don't have the guts to change it.
I'd rather be in the middle of something. I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like a second recorder and take it full-time. If something's not done full-time, it sucks.
How many times have you been the number one?
Half a year in Pribra, when it didn't work out for Kust as captain, he got hurt, then there was money trouble and he left.
We've been up since then, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I changed the number one and the number two.
Great year he was in Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and he just picked Pribram.
Budějovice wanted me out of there, and I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"Being back on the stage of the winners and hearing the anthem is sweet as ever," he laughed Phelps and had again his eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother once again rode in the auditorium, his son Boomer slept peacefully with headphones on his ears this time.
I'm having an amazing week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it'll be over, he said touched.
In the finals behind Phelps nearly two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long position.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Cup.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distant) Michael Phelps is the third athlete to control the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race, Phelps and other Americans, Ryan Lochte and Petty Officer Thiago Perreira, held the lead.
While the gold defender in the final fifty - year - old cruiser put himself on a crushed finisher, they fell off the medal stand.
An American superhero will have at least one chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the announcement of the position, he entered the final race for 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not even be overshadowed by the landscaper Ryan Murphy, who won the signatory double - he won a double track in Rio after a hundred.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third Russian Yevgenij Rylov.
While last year's world championship only holds fifth place in a two-hundredth place, in Rio he became a signatory king.
From the imaginary throne he planted Larkin, whose double he succeeded at last year's world championship.
But at the Olympics, he won a medal just now.
Canadian Penny Olexiaková and American Simone Manuel shared the gold on the cruiser's hundredth.
For 16-year-old Olexiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuela's second silver from the relay.
Swimmer gold won at OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, says touched Manuela.
The third was Sweden, Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100m butterfly race in Rio and still has silver from a two-hundredths.
By the time the sixth world record was over, Australian Cate Campbell.
Japan’s Rie Kanet won the two-seater, for which it is the first Olympic medal in twenty-seven years.
It has no valuable metal or world championships, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia's Julia Jefimov, who, in spite of the doping past, faces the hostility of both spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right to start in Rio was only required by the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the beginning of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't, or if he has another opinion about turning to an arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have had a special day.
Just about an hour before the game, they found out who they were going against.
They must have been brilliantly equipped with tactical training.
And then, in an unconventional time, the game on small court number one began.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the head of the rivals, but in the state of 19:19 they did not manage the end.
In the second they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
First of all, a number of displayed services meant a loss of 10:15 and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start of the game, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end of the last balloon, the income I used to get used to.
We lost a hundred of them, which was crucial.
In the next set, we took a look at them on the field, on the other side of the defense, and we pushed them on the service.
There's been an awful lot of mistreatment in the thie-break, and we're wearing it this way.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
It's a shame to start the first set.
We were able to download it, but we missed the daggers.
The second set was great, and in the third set he decided the service.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was five, and we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playful.
How was your little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in other castles.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour in the night, total silence, no music, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started training for the game without knowing the players, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the other teams.
But Simon (the coach of Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty good on this page.
Do you remember ever starting a midnight game?
I don't think so.
We played at 11:30, but not 12:00.
Russian Birlov's block in front of the playoffs at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Marquet Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in front of the playoffs on OH in Rio.
Was it awkward?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group of ten, we had a regime moved earlier.
That was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would, but it's not typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group's procedure was our goal, it is on the one hand fine, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep out of it, and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big brother's here, first sniffing SIM's coming.
You won't miss her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to acquire a SIM from one of the local operators when they stay in Thailand.
This is not only for tourists, but also for those with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have entered into a marriage.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takokrn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The sale plan for SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The new measures allowing the monitoring of their location are intended to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow the criminal activity to be dealt with by a foreigner.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIM is helping to identify those who exceed the allowed length of stay.
For sellers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear on the side of the SIM intended exclusively for Thais within six months.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently activated in the case of cards intended for persons without Thai passports.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at SIM for Thailand is not because we can always easily monitor," Tantasith added.
It must be added that in Thailand, prepaid payments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators distributed free start-up SIM to airport tourists.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia or Singapore, for example.
They also have mandatory registration of SIM in place, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the measures envisaged do not imply the obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator's SIM when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief on them.
Operators of the country concerned shall only know relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging SIM into their network.
So they know the phone number, but they don't know about the owner.
However, the difference between roaming prices and the rates of local operators is so disastrous that most tourists will begin to look after local SIM during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have been legally subject to immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, the planned system compares the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be threatened with an undetermined sentence.
"If the service provider follows the position of SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
Whilst there is currently a recycling of a specific number until after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not entered the network, a new number could occur after 15 days if Thailand left.
The luxury apartment in the new building in the Vineyards has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most property care is provided by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and elevators in the house, which essentially disqualified the older construction.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking floors, high energy intensity and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old construction is unable to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the modern apartment magazine.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga Studio.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend co-operation with everyone's expert?
Cooperation with the architect would be recommended to everyone, if he was proposing an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the design of the interior itself: designers have a much better idea of a range of possible materials and are able to reconcile the interior appropriately on the basis of the customer's wishes.
We already cooperated with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the client's personal recommendation, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us to reconstruct our new apartment in Vinohrad.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-accommodation space with a suitable background for a four-member family perceived as a modern but not a cold interior.
Priority was to connect the apartment to the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of implementation had to be safeguarded.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We approved all proposals including technical drawings and material samples, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we determined what we expected from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it is our collection of mainly Czech authors, including the works of Karl Malich, Karl Vyshil, Václav Špalá or Otto Gutfreunda architect, that has helped guide our taste.
The combination of black, white and nut wood was also the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc.
Did any complications arise that caused you to give up your original ideas, or did they turn up new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the time when it was first possible to ascend to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned in fact shaded the surrounding building.
That's when we literally changed our disposition overnight from base.
A granite was used on the kitchen line and on the cover of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces of the skin are dominated, for example, by the opening of the eating and bar chairs of Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning some changes here or is there something you'd like to have today?
I believe that this is a modern airspace, which primarily serves its purpose.
We're not going to change, most of the modifications after moving took place in the shade and the living area of the terrace.
Perhaps the only uplift is to the floor when the nut wood is shown to be too sensitive to the dog’s household.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the top floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new disposal solution and several other adjustments within the building.
For the interior, it is an important element of the position of the light ducts in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
That's how we got daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
Also, direct access from the main bathroom on the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
The pool and hot tub are also included.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just outside the Spanish border.
I've moved pretty much.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
It seems to me that every Frenchman is terribly negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but it's gotten worse lately.
That's interesting that you're just referring to negativity.
Because this is how some people evaluate the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
It may not come to some people when they come to France because they don't see it that much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big theme is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
And now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me just because I was Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else, and I ran into a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or bullying, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, you're still uncomfortable with someone looking at you, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the roasters care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After my job in Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I set up websites on which people offer and seek shared housing.
For the time being, we are only working in Prague, but we would like to extend it to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs in the middle and two other Czech friends.
I have to say, the other specifics of the Czech Republic are that at first they keep their distance.
He won't let anyone near his body right now.
That's pretty different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in evenings or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by making at least a little communication in English, I don't need that language to learn fast.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you seen any negative reactions?
Is it because you're Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's an experience I can think of.
My leader, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in terms of: They're not French, they're Africans.
That's what really touched me.
But if anyone had a problem with me being a Muslim, it hasn't happened to me yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, they'd give me stuff.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere nowadays.
Until recently, I may not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about the Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists protecting themselves with your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel ashamed and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow these reports of violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Jiří Square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated violence.
Have you registered it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with the violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn't do?
Do you meet in Prague and other Muslims?
For example, my coworkers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little bit more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all see it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I've been through a different education, and maybe they've been studying Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People of Islam sometimes associate with the subordinate status of women.
How do you feel?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
Rather the other way around.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
That's also why you're not wearing any headgear.
Like a hijab?
And it's signed mainly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a truly fundamental Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is purely a personal matter.
It's up to everyone to interpret it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should take his own view of the matter.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, "I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves require it, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the perfect city for it.
The Czech Muslims, along with the Christians, demonstrated violence.
Sailor Kozelska Fenzl's wind in Rio hit a gradual barrier.
Friday's trips to the sea in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were sent by Czech yachtmen Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to the tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
You collect packages like pokémons.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea of using the planned route for the transport of shipments is followed by TV director Matěj Lišek and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea of inhaling life, three apps with different geographical ranges.
We launched the National Transfer app in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for idNES.cz a forty-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can specify the route and details of how large a package you can transport and how much you want.
Someone's asking for a ride that day again.
When the route and delivery time meet, it mates, and there will be mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat room will be opened where the two of them will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it takes to make coverage completely optimal and each offer mated with demand.
On the main lifts it is already working and it is logically easier than on the way between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust so far, and they're finding out that no one's getting away with the package.
You didn't have to solve a case like this yet?
How many users have service two months after launch?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making way.
We consider that a success, and we believe that others will be packed.
Is there any chance the sender's gonna wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver things on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you'll pay several thousand in two hours for delivery.
You're going to pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers fear future loss of customers?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, large multinational carriers are fed here, as well as business chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not match what they pay for.
Nobody wants to find a note in the mailbox with a message that they have a package to pick up at the branch office, first the day after 7:00.
At the time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't piss anyone off and send a competitive signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
None of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matìj Liška as a television director.
In 2014 they started preparing the application Shipansee LTD, which uses the already planned route between the world’s metropolises, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they set up a project to process a company that created applications such as MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The Transfer application began in December of last year and was released in May.
This is a local version of Shippancee designed for the Czech market.
The application was developed by the month and the month of Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these applications from the beginning, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adjust the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has recently been the subject and this is the AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about doing something in an area that no one can say much about so far, where is the border of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and makes money, it is not their intention to circumvent financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, whether on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to tax his income if he makes it his income.
What makes you think the service has such potential?
The shipper will save and the carrier will earn, and they will reduce their travel costs.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people divide, we'd like this one to get closer.
There can be nice stories, people are happy to help and tell people about it.
Maybe someone will bring you some forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
People in my opinion have long lacked personal access, we say this app is people's service.
How, then, do you guarantee that the package courier will not leave?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the passport and lists the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give both service and credibility to a person.
Couriers also collect stars on the basis of sender ratings.
We'll also offer insurance, we'll still get the details.
For uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, the courier shall not take responsibility under criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a sealed package in his trunk with a gun or ten kilos of hashish, he'll be held responsible for the dispatcher.
Is there a threat to the abuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, they shall be registered with the supervisory authority, which, as the only one, will be able to observe it, and we ourselves are unable to see them, the data against abuse shall be protected.
How much money will he get after a successful delivery to the courier's hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he's gonna ask for.
The dispatcher shall be charged several per cent extra for the brokering of the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
The courier can also be charged with failing to deliver the package when it has actually been delivered, the takeover and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
In relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plato egg and big as a bass beer.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has a seat in the car, maybe they'll take the fridge.
Plus the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the contents.
You're gonna put a forgotten sweatshirt in your hand, and that's it.
Who came up with an idea, and how long did it take to start the service?
My friend got an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention back then.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational range that focuses mainly on the passenger aircraft.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I'd like to become an investor myself and put savings into it.
The following year it took more development than we founded Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing has been focused on the Czech Republic, where we try to capture the app, because it has all had birth pains and it is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to feedback from customers and we are currently not dealing with the foreign market that much.
We know it's a long run, but we don't take it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippsee LTD was the basic and most expensive app, the other two were in their own way upgrades.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
The courier app that wants to feed on it, we call it the Profi Moon.
So someone can make an easy living picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will download in Prague a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn a trip to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with those pokémons, they can collect this the same way.
A man sees where the orders are, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports it.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be central to shipping companies, will fill out their data on the website, or create points on the map.
Then we are able to use their services every month.
Are you now engaged in a full-time project?
It's extorting us, but it's normal for us to have a job so that we can use it and develop it.
There's no strong transnational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped in with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to cut us not in the Czech market, but who should come with us with an apology for the ball and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The historical part of Titanfall 2 is to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will according to the first information be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of network ignition in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which, apart from running, includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels aimed at reverse movement.
They're going to be like rigs, and they're going to include the engravings.
To overcome them are therefore a fundamental example of double jumps, running around walls and a rope slide.
In addition, it may be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
There will be no missing maps that resemble the maze and levels with special concepts.
In one instance, it will be possible to lift and collapse platforms and close powerful doors.
That's how you control the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should thus oscillate between the fierce action and the calmer moments to explore the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's footman with a dream of pilot's career.
Cooper will, at the start of the campaign with Captain Lastimosa, crash on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will not be any wildness for him there.
In addition, during the crash, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with operating the captain's Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls to the Titan will also be important.
Players are served as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time the robot's personal communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the Titan is to name all the injuries that Cooper is in danger of during the planned eruption.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, it will be possible to assess the result in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impression of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28th, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark is alive, but the original publishing company remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changed its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ, she obtained a number of trademarks and the right to use the company’s logo and name in 2013.
Nordic published, for example, the Darkiders 2 Death Edition or the Red Function Collection package.
In addition, 23 other games are created for the publishing industry and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found her husband, our neighbor, 20 years old.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried for him for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date someone like me.
She's gone completely crazy about him.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girlish, loving voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've seen it all.
He then went from work regularly at half past six, and so she always left at three for shopping.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
Later, I found out that they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, take the decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mentally controlling me.
Soon, I think she found that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a jerk.
At the same time, my neighbors suggested that they also knew about it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, that only a daughter knew something.
So I've always put it off, go on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to see if I could use some help in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him I got an anonymous tip, that he was seeing my wife, and he was testifying to it all.
I asked him what he was going to say.
He was standing there, shoving his shoulders, looking into the ground, and not saying a word.
Then I also met his wife on my way from the store at the time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't react and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been anywhere that has a problem getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about getting a divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all of this and her life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I've got it in me to this day.
I used to give it to her a lot of times, but I finally left it alone.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife, my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
She's always tried to make me feel like I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's good.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I can see that he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm sick of living like this.
When it started, and I wore it very badly, I once told her that she didn't want to live with me, and I asked her what she would say to me if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally she said, "But there's plenty of space here."
Prime Minister Manuel Walls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of recognition," Prime Minister Manuel Walls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing from abroad, where money often comes from preachers who are vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Walls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Islamic Foundation, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It should have contributed by then to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and the countries financing their construction.
Soon, though, she was affected by internal strife, and it never worked properly.
"It is a total failure," said Walls.
The former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as the protector of the secular state, is likely to head the new foundation.
In France, there are about 2,500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of them serving radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities have evicted about 80 Islamic clergy from the country and are considering this step in several other decades.
This week, the German police also attacked jihadist clergy.
Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them was operating a place where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution that would replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All hastened further terrorist attacks carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure funding to mix from domestic resources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where to get funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is the special fee for the hall of food, namely for meat derived from defeats under Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by food sellers for the granting of a permit.
Part of the money would then travel right into the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, some 30,000 leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who went through educational programs at the universities there should be active in the French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"Since December we have closed 20 of them and others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"In France there is no place for those who declare hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, writes the journal Independent.
There was a shooting after a woman and daughter left the garage space in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter, an ambulance had to arrive for a man in critical condition.
The act took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragonia, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably an unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Blister wraps, wakame eyelashes, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-nourished meals, only we Czechs are rebels and we have our own taste and our own head.
And so the summer garden smells like grilled necks, barrels, pork cologne.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even sometimes except salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving, and it is a social matter, and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make a good meal, which special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke.
And they'll make us feel better.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-adopted griffins will be enough to make preparation fun and food the most true exotic light.
Just like the easier rolls in the rice paper from today's recipe.
Even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is wasted here.
The paper can only be softened for a moment in the water and then only depends on the chef's fantasy of how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no eyelash.
The advantage of a variety of Asian cuisine today is that the raw materials are usually already available.
Including loaded sugar-acid ginger, which is one of the basic flavours of accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp yet delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that mixes with several types of vinegar and ginger.
All you need to do is buy a bag of appropriate size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, which promotes digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes in various festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are also very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as a "help" for preparing all kinds of roasted, cooked and roasted foods, which are packed in them in a similar way as the albino.
Banana leaves then pass on the specific flavor.
With us, they can be bought in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only green leaves, and then healthy - unspoiled and spotless.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad made of wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
He can buy the frozen again.
Anyone who often eats or prepares sushi is likely to know more about the ray of Nora.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called Nori leaf – that is, canvasses designed for the production of sushi.
Wakame - a dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae nori.
By the way, who wouldn't know the Misso soup with the wakame, Asian women are supposed to use it for postpartum recovery.
And even this eyelash has almost miraculous effects.
Cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair graying and is literally filled with mineral substances.
Dried and dissolved wakame also serves as spices, such as rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to hatch in the water, then they flash, they put in boiling water and half a minute's cooking.
Then it cools down in ice water, cuts out the middle ribs, and continues to adjust, like a favorite salad.
However, buying it already ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all you have to do is wrap a roll with an easy vegetable filling, a smooth and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a bomb of longevity.
Unless you resist and throw in an extra grilled barrel.
Eating healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that nicely combines taste.
And it's done once and for all.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green cartilage, 60 g of salad cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A slice of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a spoon of Sriracha chili sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of loaded gari of ginger, a bit of pine nuts.
Let's get the bandages ready first.
We'll wet rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we'll cook the cartilages briefly, and after about three minutes, we'll let them cool quickly into the ice water so they don't lose color.
We'll put the vegetable filling on the approved paper and wrap it up.
We prepare the fillings from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers that we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, thoroughly mix them and put them on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we will insert the sprouts, add the bandages, and finish the whole meal with an eyelash vacuum, loaded with ginger, mango patch, sprinkle the black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in seven rugby, Fiji's choice of gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom in seven football ended with a devastating trail at the last obstacle, Fiji defeated Britain in the final match Thursday night at the stadium Deodoro here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians presented a master lesson in processing, folding, bending, supporting game, running on line and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came at an unsightly price of consolation in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on that day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic football tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The winning victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals the same day, may have been frozen in the finals.
But Fiji would defeat a 15-member team in its form in full health.
You probably won't be a comfort to the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijans is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
The Great Britain has offended a part of the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat is painful, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started out magnificently, the British breakthroughs reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other players, it was like running behind a number of buses in motion, and the world cup champions led 5:0 when Oseo Collinsau emerged from the corner.
The time machine showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the balls.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fijani slowed down.
In the seventh minute, he threw Jas Veremalua's touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after returning and there was still more than 1 minute left in class... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravou, then, broke through the tiny Brits and landed on the line where he scored.
After the conversation to state 29:0 followed a break.
It was like Fiji was born for football 7s while the British were still learning to teach.
That's the way it is.
After halftime, the British made massive changes, and the Fijin effort stopped... for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until after the brilliant game, Fiji Joshua Tuisov moved on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, he threw a touchdown into the left corner of the raised an 36:7. The game had already been won by Pacific Islanders and their fans in the ochos sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the Fijan's completely joyous approach.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame further tried to defeat the Fijans.
The whistle rang, the Fijins hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely flattened.
Earlier that same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinals and the United Kingdom defeated the South African Republic in a close semifinal - a difference between one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling work, broke the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson's great late landfill, Anthony's brother from the 15th English team, guaranteed a victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired the coach to fight cancer
You can't find more emotional gold on these games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa during 220 punitive exhales in history.
While there were two of them sitting in the boat, there were three voices. When the ship whistled at the level to meet the second Olympic gold behind them in the women's doubles race, there was still the voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sports to achieve such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unconquered.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how they fly on the water level with elegant swans - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For each gold rowing medal there is a battalion of auxiliary hands that mean a bit by bit a difference, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I've suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I've undergone this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's going to change your view of things.
The cancer was found on Williams in December 2013.
The happiness for the whole trio was that he could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, off-season, and thus shorten the exception to the minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a way, but this was a little more demanding.
Immediately after the victory were their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to handle his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal artillery regiment who has a mission in Afghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotion at the bottom, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and so does Robin.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's got the biggest thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose the only race in five years.
The two set up a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark crews began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We've been focusing at the moment, at most.
Helen screamed, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to get a good time, go out and win the race, which we did.
The two will take a year to think about it before they decide what to do next.
Glover's getting married next week, her next one is a television adventurer named Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It makes me feel much better," she said.

Prison?
More like driving people free of charge, says Taximafia hunter Rubesh to the assault charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are accused, according to the Czech Republic.
You've recorded a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices, including those to be in the group that will come before the court.
You've faced a few unpleasant confrontations with exposed actors.
How much is the report on the prosecution of members of the organised group breaking down for you?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm mostly curious about judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so they can drive all the people for free.
That's a somewhat self-sustaining solution.
Does this mean that you do not feel that any punishment is effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another delivers a pizza, and one is completely out of it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think it's an appropriate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the deprivation of liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the company they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they committed the destruction of our country’s name and the despicable theft of people.
So let's make a good card now and take people out for free.
I can't imagine anything else.
It would work as a community service.
Like someone going to collect garbage, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get parole eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Sand and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
It belongs to people who started with virtual videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the Stream.cz Internet TV, where he participates in a number of shows, and is now preparing the Prague Guide show, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubesh advises which services in Prague he prefers to avoid, and which he recommends without worry to use.
He used to shoot a series with names How to do it, City of Fraud?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The prosecution refers to them as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be identified as mobsters?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from the Godfather.
It's more like mobsters - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
It's just that they're guarding each other's stalls.
The powder is all split up.
I tracked down that, for example, the main station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like taxis waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone's just watching their place, and each group is kind of organized.
It's probably a tangled network.
The defendants, however, have only seven people together, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the side effects of the streets have not disappeared.
So, what percentage do you think the Prague fraudsters have in their taxi service?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic earring in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by Karl's bridge and drives people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me for seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop him for any reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same situation is also true in other locations of Prague.
Thus, it is difficult for seven people to get away from the already famous Prague negro, which apparently has a much larger dimension.
Of course it's no use at all.
It will help, but all evil will not be washed away, that is the truth.
Are the taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still performing at the same places you showed in the reports, whether at Karl's Bridge or at Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations they stand every day and every day they break the decrees.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
He's not even a cat anymore, he's a total nuisance.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, although only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask myself, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and always will be, to make the center of Prague better.
And even if I feel like it's a little better, I'm gonna keep doing it.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
There's no way to settle for that.
But it's not like that, of course, there's more.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the taxis?
Sometimes I do test runs, and I have to say it's still bad.
I just caught a cab driver last week, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometres, although then he claimed that the amount was 56 crowns (he used a decimal point trick).
He had a receipt, police arrived, and this cab driver was so cutely insolent that he was still going to see the cops and asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
It's a similar case.
A taxi driver on a taxi meter overturned a decimal point and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Is it possible to say that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers hasn't given up even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless sums for a short drive?
Their impertinence is still unbelievable.
How'd it go with that 56-crown cab driver?
The cops sent him away, saying they couldn't discuss it with him on the spot because he put out a receipt.
And that's going to be a problem for the court (six taxi drivers and one exorcist).
On the one hand, there'll be a taxi driver with his receipts on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, a master may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming works about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use it in a story.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the courts?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a mile because he wouldn't use it.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal point that, especially in front of foreign clients, underwater taxi drivers move.
Is it still up to date, or are they worried about this thing after publishing your reports?
I think we've made this trick popular by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a taxi driver recently, bragging to me about him being the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that there was a black tape stuck on the side of the taxi meter.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
When punishments didn't work too well on a taxi driver, can the court and their colleagues be careful?
Is there anything that can keep them from cheating?
You were talking about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can stop them.
But someone from these places can push them out.
And these are the fair taxi drivers who should fight more for really getting them out of there.
In my experience, I have to say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately superior.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They taste, but they lack the mind.
He can't walk around much and can't say exactly what they want.
When they staged the demonstration (because of a proposal for a comprehensive restriction coming from the office of the principal Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn't protest against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it only came from the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you overall evaluate the access of the Prague Master's in solving the problem of driving?
Apparently, she had to go to the criminal police to figure something out.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole out there that leaked information, which means the taxi department was doing their job for a few years completely uselessly.
I hope they'll charge that official for the last checkup of all the deranged checks to make him realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing I can think of.
I was even with him on a test drive, which I learned from their schedule.
It's been months since the last parts of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with foreign viewers, which is actually what the series's most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them the videos.
And then when we go to Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people that are seen on the shots are really standing there.
Not famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a patch around them to make people look at them.
The museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a cab when you need it?
Sure.
I drive with services that I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since then.
The driver told me when he got in the car, "Well, you've got guts."
I'll be dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were already written in 2005.
In the same year, former Prime Minister Paul Behm went on a check-up tour in disguise as an Italian tourist, and at the first attempt, the driver deceived him by two hundred.
But Editor Rubesh had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him for the ride from Old Town to Václav Square 820 crowns, which comes about to 195 crowns per km, as the reporters calculated.
The Prague magistrate set the maximum price of 28 kroner per km.
Other surprising sums are also included in the filmed reportage: for example, a two-kilometre trip from the street of Paris to the Truhlářská stand tourist 400 crowns.
Dear rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which is two and a half miles [2.5 km] away, they charge about six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and as long as possible, the better.
Its impurities go well, even though dirt sometimes has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be pulled out of the folds.
It's not easy and it's not going fast, the work of the restorer Vanessa Trost from Oldřichov in Hya.
The hat down before it: the tombstone is left with the scaffolding, after which you have to climb and climb many times.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and not demanding in the workplace," she noted.
In Fryland, it's not her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Freedlant Town Hall were restored, and the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zatiší, St. John Nepomucký in Frýdlant, Piet in the Freedlant District Street, Marian Column in Frýdlant, and atlanta in the front of the spa in the New Town under Smrkem.
With the restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Christopher and Katerina from the Rederne, it began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleared from the application of impurities and crustles, the loose stone parts will be secured against falling and moving; either anchored into the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then it begins with gold painting on marble boards," said a reference to the State Monumental Care of the City Office in Frýdlant Vera Sobotová.
There's no record of the tomb going through any repairs from the past.
At a closer glance, they'll take the holes drilled into marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and they're leftovers after the tomb.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the Swedish invasion of the Thirty Years of War, everything disappeared.
They were literally combing the tomb, marked by Sobotová.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross are the restaurants with a slight overhead as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombs that were found underwater, the baptismal center, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go into the future," Saturday said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repair.
Restaurant work on the renovation of the redernova tomb will come to a total of 128 000 crowns.
They will be covered by grants, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the reconstruction.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from winning the regional round of the historic city 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns being the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor Frýdlanta Dan Ramzer.
The office decided to release the victory for the tomb restoration.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half.
Low volatility and growth prevail in markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the corrections in February, is now on the new historical maximum and has already accounted for 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that long-term traders should never go against the interests of the central banks, which, in the end, have always achieved theirs.
In a situation where US stocks are at a historical maximum, the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown satisfactorily and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank, and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below the 12 percent limit.
And I don't want to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative liberalisation in Europe and Japan is in full swing and last week has also attached its hand to the Bank of England, which will buy 70 billion pounds in bonds in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative relaxation pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long is this condition going to last?
Of course, that's a million questions.
But there are currently no risks, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilizing and brexit is no longer a topic, so we probably shouldn't be too surprised if, in a similar calm regime, US stocks continue to endure.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted for this difficult work of experienced policy, said European Commission chief Juncker, when a French policy (really tried, because it has been wiped out by so many transnational political functions that we would find it difficult to look for a better example of the so-called European elite) has been appointed the main negotiator of the European Commission for the conditions of Britain's departure from the EU.
Juncker's selection of blowoffs suggests that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek with Britain forms of future friendly coexistence.
But most British media have accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
The Great Britain hates it.
As the euro commissioner for the internal market (2009-2014), he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He took it as only he could: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
He was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and he looked forward to everything that came from the London Financial Centre of City, and he pushed legislation across the hard regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable and apparently ruthless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
How not to mention in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
And that is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this -
It would be good for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Lord of the Kremlin released his neighbor Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov on Friday as head of the presidential office.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
The Russian media informed of this with a reference to the announcement of the Kremlin press service.
Putin indicated that Ivanova was granting permission at his own request.
During a meeting broadcast by the TV station Rossia 24, the president said he was coming forward with Ivanov's wish to take office that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, which Ivanov's current representative, Vajno, will now lead, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, aged 63, is identified as one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, held the post of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, said that the duration of the stay at the head of the state chief's administration was actually a record player.
He lasted four years and eight months in it.
In this regard, he recalled that 11 people had already changed in this function 25 years after its establishment.
Even Uncle and Shafara won't play the finals.
So far, not one of Friday's tennis matches has managed to turn into a final event.
Petra Kvitová lost her first fight, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech debutists Šafarivá and Uncleova followed Kvitova.
The Williams sisters’ vanquished after winning the first set, but they lost two matches, and the Russians eventually took advantage of the set in the short game.
The second set then lost a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ondřej Sinek with an overview won his semifinals when he defeated the second Damir Martin of Croatia despite the election in conclusion almost a second.
Today good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Sonek.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So it took some strength away from them, so tomorrow could be easier.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing cards for me, said the rower of the Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The fifty-year-old rower took the fourth position in her ride today, and on Saturday she will be ready to start in the B finals and fight in the 7th to 12th place.
That's not how they defend gold from London.
For the first time in the Olympics, I didn't go to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a high-quality race, and I put everything I could into it.
The rivals were just better, Topink Knappk leaned in front of them.
She fought to the end, and she believed that in her fourth games between elite sixes.
She gave up the fight right in front of the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could step out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman who had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through Racist.
Unfortunately, today was the day of the race, she told the world champion from 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Philip Nepeichal, who failed to break through the qualification this time in bed.
In it Neejchal occupied 33rd place.
The qualifications were the best for the Russians.
Sergey Kamenski stepped from the first stop with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Neejchal's shot was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, including Czech seven fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachov belongs after the second discipline of the Olympic competition 11th place, Czech recorder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
Leads by Britka Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as did the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the historic best craftsmanship in the 7th fight.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they didn't make it.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we consider the absurdity of the questions raised as follows: German society has gone through a deep seberflexi, but Russian is not.
In the two great European nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed largely to 94 million victims of communism, as reported in the Black Book of Communism, whether it is daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis have wiped out about 6 million Jews in inhumane ways, and the total victim of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets committed atrocities in occupied or deserted territories.
It was not only a few individuals in Germany or in the USSR, but a large part of the nation participated actively, passively or only in cowardice or in the sand.
This is not just the specificity of these peoples, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, immediately the end of the war came taxation, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
Most important, however, came later.
When the children grew up, they started asking, "Dad, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you do that?
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to connect them back to Alsasko-Lotrinsko or to someone - to rematch - militaryly attack - that everyone may recognize.
After the lost cold war in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putinov is to rematch, conquer lost territories, humiliate the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of its own people are of no value to the summit.
Beat yours, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only these decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from rising tension around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea area has deteriorated.
Who benefit from the increase in tension?
After a longer period of relative calm, there was another deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian side was the basis for the Crimea peninsula, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides of the enemy contradict each other and are difficult to verify independently, so we have only the opportunity to think about an old known question to whom does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information on the arrest of members of the Ukrainian Special Forces in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of pilot Savchenka known reply that they were allegedly abducted in the territory of Russia.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further approval of sanctions and reinforcement of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a drawback from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost completely credit to its residents, with the current support of President Poroshenko moving around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long been bankrupt from the EU's generous financial injections and, above all, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime again needs to pay strong attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show up as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russian.
It remains to be hoped that all those who try to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their enemy action in time.
Bulgaria first inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate reached 1 % in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value in several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October of last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 100.0 % and the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month, the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7%), transport (1,8 %), culture and recreation (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), other goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Service has been watching the hacking of the Russians for a year.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Investigation Authority (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party Centre.
However, no official report is mentioned on Russia's participation in the attack.
Moscow denied the part of the attack.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was highly classified because it would reveal that US secret services are monitoring and revealing the way they are doing it and the resources they are using.
Two Russian intelligence services were said to have participated in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The Russian trace tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public figures, only a small group of eight congressional leaders, called in the US Gang Eight, were informed.
It is created by the heads of both Chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, presidents of the Democrats in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Defence and Security Committees of Congress.
The official head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she is creating an advisory body for cyber security, which is to "prevent future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the lovely salmon from Alberto.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of consumer incentives for health problems after the consumption of the food salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 carried out Prague hygiene control in the shops Albert on the Wenceslas Square and on the Bridge.
The check found that the lot of L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out was no longer available and therefore the product of the identical lot with the date of consumption was taken on 11.12.2016.
The laboratory test confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body cavity or the muscles of fish are a strong allergen and a person exposed to live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Schicha.
We apologize very much to customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the lot from the sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
There was doubt on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we ourselves let this product be tested, she told the news speakers Alberto Barbor Vanko.
If a customer buys this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrnata.
The presence of a dangerous product has been informed by the Prague and Central Czech veterinary administration.
According to the server, the safety of the potravin.cz people after the sighting of the parasite can get anisakiosis, which will be shown by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without a sign, the CTK said.
Symptoms are delivered within an hour to two weeks after consumption of a sufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the start of larvae disease, they will usually spontaneously abandon the treatment tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either during sufficient heat treatment or freezing of fish meat.
The veterinarians currently checked the salmon also with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
A shipment of 1,700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expeditioned, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, there were 919 packages by today.
Currently there is a download of the unsold stock of the product from the shops, Czech Republic spokesman SVS Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
The veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from storage immediately after finding positive samples.
Seventeen-year-old Brita wanted to escape from Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was killed in the first place, there was sobering up.
The expected paradise of the caliphate turned for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called her in Britain repeatedly and confided in herself that she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without purpose, quotes The Telegraph as a lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunye.
The last clues led to Rakka, which is where the girl came from for the last time.
Then there was just a message about her death that could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in eastern London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet their former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house in which she was staying was compared to the country in May, Britain’s ITV News reported.
Television reported that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You would take the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunye, the family's lawyer.
In a week when (Kadiza) was thinking of escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakabashka was caught in an escape attempt and was publicly killed to death according to available information.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any chances, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amir Abbas went on their way on February 17th last year.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they went to Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey to the territory of the controlled IS.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything they could to get Kadiz back.
You would take the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything it could to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing he thinks is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent case for other girls, or even boys, who are going to be fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, they have realized how things are there, they understand how far it is from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and they want to go back," Akuñee further said.
Cadiz's classmates' fate is unknown.
But since they also remained silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For centuries the village of Inveray was the district center and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid - 18th century, courts have been held on the town hall, and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts were staying were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
That's why the city's representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
In any event, it has not been in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons since the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair facilities were expensive for operation and did not pay too much.
The stories of detention and the hunt for ghosts.
For the public the prison opened centuries later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed.
The guides in time costumes are still strengthening the authentic experience.
There is also a torture chamber in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment have been applied to criminals, whether it is to break fingers or burn marks on the body.
In the course of the tour, tourists may be allowed to lock themselves in one of the cells, mostly because of a photograph on the monument, or to show themselves the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, the Inveray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is said to be afraid.
There have already been several groups of hunters of paranormal activities, and to this day the museum allows people to come hunting some spirits.
Such a night will, of course, go up to 300 pounds, which is an estimate of approximately 9,500 crowns.
Apart from this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panorama and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application allows about 150 million users to change reality every day and play with the identity of ways that border with absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character that looks like it came out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will immediately be made public.
Snapchat filters in the past have served to criticise that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that made their eyes sharp, crooked teeth and puffy faces, some critics called it the racist cartoon of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions pointed to a larger problem for society - the problem of diversification.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and news and indignation spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately said the next day that the function had been cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was designed as an account for the figures of the anime, not as a cartoon of the Asians.
But to observers who were witnesses to racism, the filter was like painful stereotypes in action.
Others refused to compare with the anime without packaging.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose photo tweet was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon with the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is being pulled into a contemptible extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has in it an endless struggle for diversification and inclusion, from the boardrooms of corporations to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"If one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to one user," said Katie Zhu, five-twenty-five on Thursday in an interview, "it will be very difficult to do these things today without notice as it was before."
Katie Zhuová, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account on Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversification in Snapchat’s recruitment.
Katie Zhuová criticized the predominant white, entirely male management of the company and the article ended with hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there is no diversification between employees and colourful people at the moment these matters are decided," said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origin, "or there are colored people working, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish the figures concerning the diversification of its employees by having the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesman, the company had recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the underrepresented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: “I’m wondering if they really need other users who can say that it’s wrong” with their account being cancelled.
Military officers have distorted information on IS, the parliamentary committee says
In a report issued Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that officers from the Central Command of the United States had amended the reports of the reporting service to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence Services and the Sub-Committee on Defence, there has been a finding of a "vasive dissatisfaction" among Central Intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors have changed their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report states: “The output of intelligence secret services approved by senior Centcom officers usually provided a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism efforts than was confirmed by the facts on the ground and was consistently positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when the policy makers are presented with a false analysis," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the persistent problems of the headquarters staff in describing and analysing American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the top officials of Obama's administration have ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press reports from the central headquarters, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what actually happened," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom announced publicly that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under Islamic control.
"This is clear after months of investigation," said Member Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican party from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest position was manipulated by US headquarters intelligence staff with headquarters intelligence services outputs in order to mitigate the IS risk in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after they learned of the concerns of analysts that information about the reporting services concerning the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by a further investigation.
In Centcom's intelligence services, there is still another investigation conducted by the Department of Defense's General Inspector.
The democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the working group of the republicans.
‘From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for drawing up an assessment of information on IS and Iraqi security components,’ said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “has led to the distortion of reporting services,” damaged the morals of analysts and “not sufficiently taken into account dissenting opinions. ”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would be trying to push Centcom analysts to adjust their findings according to "proposal or political situation".
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the general inspector of the Pentagon, which was initiated after the complaints of Centcom's analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report because the Inspector General's investigation was still ongoing.
However, he said that “the adversaries sometimes disagree with the interpretation of comprehensive data and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security.”
The investigation has an impact on the question of whether the Americans in charge of the bombing in Iraq and Syria have been successful (the verdict that now declares an increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's indictment raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to sincerely evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Reporting criticism of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when news analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - in spite of objections from many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance to Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements of the opposite, air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the financial resources of the terrorist group, as the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transmitted outside headquarters.
Head of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized in the past year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony too positive by assessing the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The U.S. has won ground hockey in the fourth round, so today a decisive match in the UK team will be played
Katie Bam in the match against Japan, who ended up winning 6:1, scored three goals and only the day after that for the American women's team of ground hockey scored the first two goals of the match, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games are good to remember, but Bam (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever succeeded.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those guys who writes down their bracelets.
But this knows: Americans lead the 4-0 Olympic tournament and share the first place in a group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide who of the six teams ends up first and second.
The team from the first place is a little longer to avoid the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group.
No matter how much the game ends on Saturday, the Americans set off their surprise ride here, four years after they ended up with 12 teams playing games in London.
There was also Bam on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and played hockey on ground hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The 2008 Olympics missed her because she didn't get on the final list.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor members of her team had much success.
The following year, the coach was named Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal with a backend nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly hard and held the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then called out Wednesday and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in half a quarter.
Disengagement of American goalie Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped one goalie, was the first in the tournament.
It's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampolines in the middle of Olympic rage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is felt a persistent, indescribable and busy alteration of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot stick that's passed from the swinger to the swimmer, the gymnast and the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the coming mistress of women with pits in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will ring in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and spot sponsors if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a charmer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic Fire doesn't shine on all the competitions the same.
Far from Wednesday, a little in the shadows are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have success in the classic swim style - and it'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw your attention to the subtle magic of trampoline.
Although jumping on the trampoline is an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced to the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost undetected - many people I asked myself didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US has never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and until 2012, none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be held by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline have more bad luck, partly because the ear of the unholy one will seem to be more suitable for the clown university than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a country-watching enthusiast.
It has a comical potential - a comical vibration of endless reflection - but also a smoothness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline” meaning “jumping board.”
Aspirating champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and perform compositions with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulty and "times in the air".
Twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
The warriors of the gold medal must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only on the target tape or the starting wall, but also, according to television news, on another imaginary line: a world record or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to lead viewers to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumps on trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track of an athlete on a trampoline is up.
Meaning is not moving forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a state without weight as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and of course no difficulty can be achieved, but during the duration of the composition no fierce struggle for achieving the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, good timing and gravity will prevail.
This is the closest thing to an Olympics and Zen coming.
The qualifications and finals of women are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC station will broadcast the final within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a calm, pleasant moment, which you will probably overlook through other battles.
And if the attention is to be paid only by men's athletes being the subject of a loving view and materialization - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the U.S. gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
“Protesting Generation” in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses claim that many protestors were shot during clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been plagued by anti-government unrest, which has spread to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to organizations fighting for human rights, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the cops shot and killed a bunch of unarmed demonstrators.
On the rolling video recordings of protests likely from the end of last year or early this year, members of the security forces are caught beating young people with homage after being forced to stand by the wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now demands a thorough examination.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is promoted by the West.
US military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to address the dangers of terrorist attacks in the area, especially Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - even a new suburban train is taking place in Addis Ababa's capital.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without stopping talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were evicted, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough," said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
Complaints are many and concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this vaguely marked border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anylists fear that Separatist groups, which have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit and re-arm.
There are several factors that explain why now after years of sneaking under the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first one is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become available and Internet services have improved.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate via an Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they gathered for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Orama and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long period of time, the Amharics, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and used the Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulatu Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigraj ethnic group, which make up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the disturbance is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenavi, former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to unspecified diseases.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see a corner.
Analysts say he was particularly able to detect the initial signs of dissatisfaction and use his envoys to process and win the opposition.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigraean region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't have confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005 was when thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government had squandered and then stole.
A severe intervention followed, during which many protestors were killed - even though less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Experts on development appreciated the leaders of Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protestors in Gondar, Amharic, attacked businesses owned by Tigraeans and grew indignant against the Tigraeans on social networks.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently declared that the base had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to break up in an already volatile area.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of sharp."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and the financing of the IS as "sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump tried Friday to embezzle the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign, stating that he did not mean it when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also places himself in an unpleasant position by his supporters, who have been trying hard to defend him during the stormy times and who must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed Thursday and in interviews insisted that he really did not intend to say that the President and H. Clinton IS had created.
However, on a Twitter post Friday morning Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the old's claim just one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's note by reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes the moment Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in electoral surveys are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this subject again.
On Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and he said that her speech was somewhat boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense earlier.
At the end of July, when he collected a wave of criticism when he proposed that the Russians should enter Clinton's e-mails, he would explain his note later with the words, "Of course, I am sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to mitigate them as necessary.
"I think it is his way of testing to what extent some reports have responded to his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction then in one way or another he "explained", said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language both candidates used.
However, I also think that he is reverse in his statements and knows that they are sufficiently hesitant to be explained in different ways.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen even more of a pinching tone in recent days, rather than making things easier for the general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is very far away from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes brought to the unpleasant situation of his devoted followers, who must stand by him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York City Mayor, who is one of the most prominent Trump supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview for CNN extensively.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's credibility of the claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he called quite wrongly a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his army from Iraq.
Most ordinary republicans try to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as foreign minister, allowed the IS to rise and fail to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fan the fire on Twitter about the media for passing over every word he had and for taking an interest in him.
He laughed at “the poor, pathetic ” TV students who tried to understand him and said,“ They can’t do that! ”
Several Democrats have taken advantage of Trump's apology that it is just another proof that he is not eligible for the presidency.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market. Now it's back in Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe cafe was a charming place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
It was natural that she was pushed out of the front of the Bedford Avenue house.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cake soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabpple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is looted, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original coffee shop, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things the way they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model machine for espresso.
He even used the old Verbe lighting again.
Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The offer includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The coffee shop doesn't serve beer anymore, but it offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant tide of the original stampists.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg for prices," he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
She was coming even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she gave herself a mixed chai, another novelty instead of her usual ice coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been loyal to Verbe since 2003.
He goes before work and orders the same thing all the time.
"At quarter and eight I come here every day, like clockwork, and they are already preparing for me my goose with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he normally orders, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his goose.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice manufacturer wants to pour in bottles and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the coffee shop to expand to the next building.
A lot of customers just got their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopened, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in “Square Meal”
Shortly after his office as president in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Ovalna office and dining room.
President Roosevelt was enjoying selected foods from 5th Avenue, such as a goose liver paw and a Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu on this day was more modest: the egg in the devil's way in paradise sauce, potato mashed potatoes and as dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message for Americans to eat. ”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane's book "97 Orchard" tells the story of a residential house on Lower East Side through food.
Their new "A Square Meal" published by Harper on Tuesday is the history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They themselves have shown chef solidarity and have met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, strict buffet in Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which, according to a couple, was excellent for talking about food during the crisis.
"Carbanettes were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and beans were sold.
They were made from that premium and other cheap food that the ingredients set up.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe got a bite.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years leading up to the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet for what you eat.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly baked pie.
They were Americans who were sending food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" watches how the nation was coping with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said in an explanation of why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods, such as casseroles and casseroles, were spread as “a wonderful way to use the leftovers,” noted Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide the aesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effective luxury.
Strange mixtures that were supposed to serve as calories and nutrients were preferred over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During her research for a book containing prescriptions, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal of baked onion filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a favorite dinner table addition," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: “It was surreal. ”
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, the wider Federal Office for Home Economics in the years 1923 to 1943 - have governed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget obstacles, and bats, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned them into delicious foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical aspirations.
First of all, the flavors came from the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Hoover, "I will have a cake".
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as a chosen millionaire.
"The council ate continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gold-plated room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him take an example with his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the White House "not only being served almost the most expensive food in all of Washington, but also in the most dissatisfying way."
A number of eating habits from the times of the crisis sounded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutrients, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
Some say that during writing the book they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She had real fear of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “It was bad for the people of her. ”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had a clean table, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” said Ziegelman, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly took the spoon into thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as the right host, he said to his wife: “It would be good to have a little sliced hair. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who descend into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what the show would look like if we were filming them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their native country.
Using photoshops, they create collages that are funny to show what it would look like if famous shows and films were made in Russia.
Gilead is eligible for legal representation in the case of type C patent against Merck Group
The District Court’s Judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to pay the fees for lawyers which it had incurred in the case of a type C patent against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead was to pay $200 million in damages for the violation of Merck’s two patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge had repeatedly found illegal conduct on Merck’s part, except for other lies under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman told the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to pardon the charges incurred in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the drug market of the new generation against yellowish type C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of the drugs from Gilead.
US-supported military units claim to have gained full control of Manbuj City
US-supported military units gained full control over the northern city of Manbuj near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State from the city fled, the group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after leaving the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The units freed more than 2,000 civilians who were being held by radicals, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbuja Military Council.
"The place is now completely under our control, but we are still searching it," Reuters said.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015, which states that presidential candidates for Democrats and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million in that year and had a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
Clinton spent $1 million on charity in 2015, mostly at the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million for lectures to the joint fund, and the former foreign minister admitted a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book on his activities at the foreign ministry.
Clinton's associate candidate, American Senator Tim Caine of the state of Virginia, along with their wife Anne Holton, published a tax return in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the Clintons campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It's customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law doesn't give them that.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers quoted the U.S. Treasury Tax Department's audit as a reason for his refusal to release tax returns.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign partner on Twitter and referred to the tax return of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, the special counsellor of Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump's tax returns to be released until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among whom the Republican candidate for President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, trade transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is speaking strongly on the issue and published a video on Friday reminding how high the status of the republic on Trump insists that he publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, mention the issue in your speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"She refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have done after decades - publish her tax returns," she told people.
Politico stated that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that this could be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton enforces a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, called Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump is not afraid of the financial authority, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns until 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, it only makes $100 in their incomes.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
This process was also proven by the Honeyguide Foundation, which came with the idea several years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and educates volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how to protect their homes and crops through this nonviolent process in four steps without hurting animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves before.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... set of instruments, we have recorded a change in behaviour in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light up the battery on the passing elephant and run the cluckson.
If he doesn't, he'll be thrown out of the so-called "chilli cloud".
Chilli powder mixed with salt will wrap with a firecracker in a condom, its end is entwined so that only a knot can see it.
After the blast, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is dispersed into the air.
In most cases, a single curtain is sufficient and the elephant is issued in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director relied on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel to “request” the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin sparked a stir in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee, on the basis of the “requirement” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary on the Holocaust “Shoah”, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay with Lanzmann, he tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes in the hotel.
However, the state has not been listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and he turned to the hotel reception with a problem.
The answer he received was Lanzmanna, according to his words, “shocked. ”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was “decided after the management of Kempinski Hotels”.
The director’s reason for this step was even more puzzling.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the call code of Israel be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the staff as saying in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great disgrace".
We were terrified and shocked by the events.
It's a huge disgrace in itself.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is an even greater disgrace.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong reaction online, people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“A shame to you,” says another article, which points out that the hotel, located on the noble street Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to the newspaper Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly made any accusation by calling the event “examination” and Lanzman“ apologized. ”
“No direct order has ever been issued” not to include Israel in the list of call codes, quoted Suddeutsche Zeitung as representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against protesting Brazilian students
There was a conflict between students and police in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when students met for a demonstration against government reform in the public education system.
Police against protesters used tear gas and rubber missiles.
The problem was compounded when the government's orderly services tried to expand the students, which ended up the police using rubber missiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals made by the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see signs spraying against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protestors massed themselves into the streets to support President Dilma Roussoff's assembly when the Senate in the country decided on her indictment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dhagaryan increased by 70.9 per cent in annual comparison following the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the Ambassador said, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest on the part of the Russian companies that are trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade has ensured delivery of hardware, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarian also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranians.
Moreover, Iran first reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be exceeded," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at a fair in Rio, when the trio of the VB team defended the title from London 2012.
A three-twenty-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took as his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man pleased the legend when he reached the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth at the world championship in the road cycle in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for a specialized introductory racer named Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoye left, there was also a vacancy that tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hinds - who was with Hoy the champion four years ago - and Skinner achieved the Olympic record in qualification, but the trick took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British Trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hinds was slightly behind his wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner maintained the lead.
The change of strategy was a large part of the transformation when Hindes went to a higher gear to slow down and enable Kenny and in part Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy race watched from his position as BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hinds took the stage, he kept his eyes on them.
A 32 - year - old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We've created an Olympic record in the finals and we've defeated the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose after a weak start.
The note was later withdrawn and the rivals of Britain had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London. ”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten contests in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we will have a successful five-day tour of the fair.
With the form Kenny presented, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sports, on this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy won.
As next Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and takes another three days.
An eighty - two - year - old relative from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins two more gold medals, he should receive a knight’s title. ”
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-mile race.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (2:42) take place on today's second day of the race, which will surely be targeted by Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioner when the referees called on him to measure the height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavai achieved a world record with the time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of road cycling and controlled the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during preparation for Rio.
There have been dramatic events in the background, not least the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April for charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of a career of great men such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the fair proves, it seems that the legendary reputation that the team of Great Britain can give a top performance with perfect timing could be reconfirmed.
Uncertain future of the factory in Portland after the termination of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland gas station in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that the company supplies with electricity and which informed of the intention of one of the owners of the factory to terminate the electricity supply contract. It is expected that all the electricity supply contracts will be reduced.
This step comes after the government of Victoria decided earlier this year not to extend the granting of subsidies which the company is maintaining.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk for up to 2,000 jobs.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closing.
And since the pan consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, other avalanche effects may occur.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's factory in Portland is dilapidated and threatened with closure.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley Valley, announced that it expects that some of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Aluminum Joint Undertaking, small shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portuguese plant to continue to function, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the pan will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’ which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that contracts will participate in the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written down the value of contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “in case of termination”.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘has no effect on its ... ability to operate the plant or to secure the supply of electricity to the plant’.
The US company stated that it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years in 2010, which was due to start from November of this year, even if it still had to explain why it had resigned from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle due to a weak economy in the sector.
Head of operation AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts per year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the reality TV show of the Kardashians - he is now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Chris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the front page of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, Ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who was performing on a fascist week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply continuing humorous in Kardashian?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the color pickers Rob and Caitly and all their favorite uncles from show business, producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sister forgot only so that the scene could end with a classic twist: preparing a secret party.
It is a feature line of almost every “birthday” part of the children’s television show (Seacrest says: “Did you think that we forgot about you?” with the honesty of the cartoon bunny on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Chris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls in this audience could live.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
Sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the most sold issue of the year.
The publication, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of adverts (Fachionist estimated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the front page is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the magazine’s images have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly shown more “celebrates that make models” than “models that are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, holder of Oscar and ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, one year later she was honored by Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as the “breakdown model” of her generation - will fall into the first category, it will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to familiar people, nor the stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are well-talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled by Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymour, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings were rekindled by the report that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's playing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you a make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she took for Love magazine.
And at leisure it works in reality show, maybe just as one way to see Courtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centres and are themselves preparing for the impact that further financial constraints on the already overburdened services will have on the sector.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, threatened workers, victims of violence and people without funding to fight unjust evictions and the like - are already refusing to seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 per cent of federal finances.
The director of community aid centres in Queenslad James Farrell said that according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Aid Centres found that 5,000 people were rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the decision of the federal government, the situation would get worse.
"The Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from their relationship with a rapist, people with excessive and horrifying debts, families undergoing separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not have the chance to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, leading to the need for thousands more vulnerable people from Queensland to face complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on State Attorney and Senator Queensland George Brandis to prevent this cuts in finances immediately, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government has been obliged to ensure that legal aid is financed up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community legal aid centres and the communities of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A complaint against Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun at him.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina pointed a gun at a staff member during a Jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court case that was handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former state-run software trainer on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said that he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that “it would not happen that way”.
Director Earl Phillip “pointed his fingers to the gun, gave the right index finger to the trigger, and pointed the head at Vincent’s face, ” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The report states that Bordini, after a complaint with local and regional campaign management, found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
‘The weapons need not be fired to cause damage,’ Bordini said in his complaint.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate has raised a complaint when he told the voters in North Carolina that the owners and gunholders (which is modified in the US in the second appendix of the constitution) could step forward if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could appoint her judge.
Trump's campaign says the media ripped his words out of context and Trump didn't defend the violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for reckless supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond to a report requesting a comment immediately.
Attempts to get statements from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local reporting branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not been responded in a short period of time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of reconstruction and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me Heathrow is very attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games meant huge benefits for both Startford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new learning places, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would laugh on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
Obstacles will always have to be overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth by £211 billion, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment, both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, within the time frame and with the budget set, introduced an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the world's best terminal five years after itself, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most disturbing wounds in the world.
Now they're ready to add a third rant worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be a success.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic games and expanding Heathrow, to secure business for the future, and to leave the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the board of directors and former Deputy for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in advertising blocking
From attempts to bypass advertising programs, the game became a cat and mouse game for companies that make money online marketing. At least one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a post on its website stating that users can update the filters in their program and reblock the advertising on this social network.
Facebook on Tuesday stated that its desktop website will change the coding around advertisements to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But now Adblock says the new codes have already passed.
Adblock's spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open-source advertising community and those who are trying to bypass it has been going on ever since advertising was invented” and that Facebook is likely to come with another self-repair.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has joined the war only proves how big a problem the blocking of advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair made it last year and Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits from Facebook advertising, Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users every day.
The speaker said that the company is going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters for mobile apps for the social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents a profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how advertising is displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are disturbing them because they could also block content that is not related to advertising.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," the Facebook speaker said in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, so we prefer to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences to control people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident where a woman who probably tried to commit suicide was on the highway Thursday morning.
There was an accident on the A1 motorway near Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
In a statement, the Vaud police said that the actress of “the desperate act ” was lying in the dark on the road and was overrun by several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to the police, not all have yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who have witnessed accidents to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, said to Le Tribune de Geneva's lawyer Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This must be what the prosecutor needs to know," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not appear to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of a negligence charge after she struck down and executed a man lying on the A1 highway near Paynerne last night.
In court it was reported that the victim was drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation, ” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that took place at Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is the popular destination of LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects as many as 20,000 visitors to Prague within Prague Pride.
On Friday, AČCKA Executive Director Kateřina Petríčková informed.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petříčková said.
According to the survey of the organizers, foreign visitors spend an average of 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are supported by special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"It is generally true for tourism that LGBT is a very lucrative clientele, interested in staying in higher price relationships with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others," Petríčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium takes place this year as part of the festival programme.
It is taught by experts from the LGBT sector of tourism from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday 14 August.
The main theme this year is love, but the action will also focus on several thematic areas: family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The festival will be held on Saturday with a traditional tour with allegorical cars, which will go from Václav Square to Letna.
The occasion that thousands of people attended last year is this year to celebrate a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt have been celebrating for 40 years.
Unsullied chiseled Pat and Matt, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained small and large viewers for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening's series directed by Lubomír Beneš was premiered on August 12, 1976.
With the production of this animated series, now known to viewers in over a hundred countries of the world, there were cartoons by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented a magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Benes then called for the collaboration of the dramaturgo Jiří Kubička and the artist Vladimir Jiranek and together created the film Kuťáčí.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radio show was received by characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak TV began in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then received in 1985, this time it was already running directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 he founded Lubomír Beneš his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other artists, many of whom were part of Beneš’s son, Marek.
At present there are over ninety episodes with stories of these boxes that are all wrapped under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always filled with optimism, ideas, and emotional enthusiasm, and they are finally satisfied with their work, which is a familiar gesture "...and that is it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, to DVDs and to theatres and plays or other toys depicting Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy.
A story for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
At the end of the week, there's a fairy tale, and we've chosen for you one sport and one of our lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's have a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what are the things that people spend most on at airports?
That's a Friday review of the world's websites.
First Olympic medals.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this island won the final Olympic seven-racial football tournament in the UK.
It's the first medal Fiji's ever won in the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal took 60 years to send the first trip to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji has a lot of credit for his success.
But it's ironic that he's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has led since 2013 and to the final as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his own countrymen.
"Let's go play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest match in our history," the coach said before the finals.
In the end, Fiji was sovereignly controlled, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic story.
The report was delivered by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without hands and feet for 11 months, has got a new friend.
A doll who looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and feet and then sit together without prosthetics.
In less than a year of life, meningitis type B was diagnosed, and only a 10% chance of survival was given by doctors.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got surveillance, too.
I've seen her introduce herself to the other kids with the words hello, I'm Harmony, and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most at the airport for?
CNN brings a finding that people at airports spend the most on packed water.
The Hudson's Travel Essential Stores chain published data in the last year where it collects 10 products that customers in its airport stores buy most frequently.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very popular, and eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place occupied a large package of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the first ten?
As one of the above things cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they're laughing at Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been reigning in the category of twos without a rudder for seven years and have confirmed their domination even at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the unrelated couple switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
On the lagoon of Rodrigo de Freitas, they scored 69th in a row in the Thursday final.
What are we different from the others?
We're just nicer, he's been teasing Murray during the Olympic regatta when he's supposed to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we don't do anything different than the others.
We're just training hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray already more seriously.
Their authority is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a two-meter and stoke chastity, the academic-looking Bond is 5 centimeters smaller and 15 kilos lighter.
Besides, they're different in nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has a charity boxing match.
Even so, he doesn't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric boards the ship essentially because we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted, who even at the press conference gave the impression that Murray was the dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy their opponents with a calm force.
They are driving their pace, and although often not yet in the middle of the line, the opponents have yet to find a prescription for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first kilometer down.
We're just trying to move at a pace no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals in the world championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of a gold four without a rudder.
Just after an unexpected failure, the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics decided to move to a two-man without a rudder.
At the London Olympics, apparently the greatest defeat of their careers was abolished and the dominant confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were on it mentally well, Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to overthrow us.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
Climate model according to NASA: Venus was once a resident
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once a resident.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by scientists involved in climate studies.
The model was designed to determine whether once, on Venus, the surface of which is hot, water-free and saturated CO2 could have been subject to conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of Venus’ rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and turned slowly.
The model also dealt with earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet there were probably more dry areas than on Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent more suppressed.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during a slow turn, it exhibits its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time,” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the rain is formed, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act as umbrellas and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures, which are in fact slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model drew up a Venus story similar to that previously hypothetically made by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably a resident in the past -- over several billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated, and water vapours were burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen has escaped and there is only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his position as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team, as a reason for his inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice president/general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the last three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
For a long and intensive time over the years, I have been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be able to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to winning 112 points and first place in the Central Division. However, Colorado competed with Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and during the last two years he has not always had a match after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and lacked five points to get a second wild card in the Western conference.
The goalkeeper Roy, who joined the Hall of Fame, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Oil rig workers in the North Sea resume interviews and interrupt strikes
The leaders of the parties stated that the strikes due to salaries for oil rig workers in the North Sea were interrupted, while all parties to the dispute met on a new round of negotiations.
There have been sporadic strikes against the oil company Wood Group in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘The Guide Group and the Union and RMT trade organisations may confirm that they have agreed to resume the process of resolving current disagreements,’ the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-long meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, is to protest wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group reduced its rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell deleted thousands of people from his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and natural gas operations in up to 10 countries for the modernisation of its processes - immediately after a mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with trade unions to discuss one of the biggest working disagreements of the entire generation leading to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," he said.
By comparison, almost $1.4 billion is expected in 2016 to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speed of star rotation from the Pleiady constellation.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the constellation are spinning at different speeds, and how the time of rotation relates to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between star matter, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, research worker at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Star of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many stars in the crash are now reaching adulthood and have been created for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning as fast as it can.
At the moment of maximum speed, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect.
Along with the age of the star, its speed of rotation also slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinguishable points on the stars -- similar to solar spots.
According to the latest data on speeds, larger stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger pyruets make them slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' we see that the slower the rolling stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades are so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"Pleads provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There is still much that we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and say, “They will hang their dancing shoes on a nail. ”
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rotation rate of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the magazine Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign in, then the qualifying agreement wouldn't be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without applying for special education?
It is my concern that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a job available only in a slightly more remote hospital, but in about half a year, there could be a vacancy in others where I would like to work.
So I do not know how to resolve the situation roughly that six months ago, the question continues.
Mgr. Lenka Vuková responds.
No legislation establishes the obligation to enter into a qualifying agreement with the hospital’s employer.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure that the costs incurred are reimbursed by increasing or deepening the qualifications of an employee.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being exerted on the non-conclusion of these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Under Act No 95/2004 Coll., the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialized competence to carry out the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist are expressly considered to be an intensification of the qualification (not as an increase).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation nor does it provide for the obligation to apply for special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applying for specialisation education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is authorised to carry out the profession of a doctor already through the completion of the required university study, even though under statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where a doctor’s special training may include professional practice in another field of specialisation where its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the Tazatelka.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know any more of the circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult with the competent department of the Ministry of Health (the Committee of Science and Medical Affairs), as the Ministry of Health of the Law provides advice and consultation services related to the inclusion in and the course of specialised education.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides advisory services free of charge, to which every doctor must be a member.
The doctors from the Syrian Halab are asking for US intervention.
The United States has not made any efforts to end the siege (the rebel part of the city by the government troops) and has not taken advantage of its influence on the enforcement of the protection of civilians, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House by the AFP.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create an airless zone over East Halab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar Assad, have announced that they will stop daily strikes in the Halab area for three hours each day to allow the safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
