Where's your father?
This book isn't Tom's.
Be very careful with that.
I just wish I could speak French a little better.

How do you feel about us these days?
Is there still room available?
I think you've done enough.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Mary, take a look at Tom.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's leave it another time.
What's the weather gonna be tomorrow?
I'll clean up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.
Thank you so much!
I don't care what you think.

Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and dodged.
Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered in leather.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking in French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
Spring's late this year.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.
You haven't given me as much change as you need.
I might be able to find time to help you.
Tom found it.

Excuse me, how much is that?
It's time to think about your past.
Is he going to recover?
I'm beginning to understand that would be impossible.
I've waited three days.
He had no idea when to start.
Wet clothes stick to the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Take this road and when you get to the light, turn left.

Did you pay your phone bill?
We've done our jobs, so we can go.
Hand over your homework!
Nothing interesting is happening in this little town.
I know someone who speaks French very well.
Happy birthday!
Oh, now I get it.
He messed it up with someone else.

I don't care why.

Tom won't be here in time.
What's he doing today?
He almost got killed.
One glass of water, please.
You scared me.
I have to decide what to do.
I think Tom's doing just fine.
You don't understand.
I'm used to my parents ignoring me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
There was a picture in his letter.

I'll keep that in mind.
Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret to herself.
Is that your pen?
He disappeared without a trace.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think this should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His wish has finally come true.
Do you want to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve excellent food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'm going to study French this afternoon.
I've had a hard time solving this problem.
How long will it take?
They look so much like each other, I don't know what that is.
We got very bad luck.
Please, have patience.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
The rain kept me from coming.
Ken calls me every day.

Can't you do that?
No, they're too small.
He gave me what I needed.
I missed you so much!
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry Tom.
It'll be a start.
How much sugar do you put in?
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover themselves with leaves.
Watch my fingers.
She speaks good English, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You didn't eat from the cake I made, but your sister ate.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't want to speak French today.
I think it's yours.
Stand up, if you please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
This is Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on a diet.
Speak up so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you go back to the beach this afternoon?
She's three years older than me.

When was the last time you went to the beach?
Don't back off.
Because it was raining, we didn't go on a picnic.
I wish Tom could be here with us today.
I'm in the house.
Do I have to open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
The news got us excited.
Are you cold?
I've never been king of anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like to listen to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak a little French.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They get along well with their neighbors.
Tom didn't say anything about that?
French isn't that hard to learn.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your house.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are your goals?
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'd have a pretty good time.
I forgot his name.
We're not in a hurry.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale live.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I'm not going to ask him.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom has to do.

Are you sure you want to leave?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.

Only through my body!

We're always looking forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to find out who Tom's planning to give it to.
Unbelievable!
That's all you can really do.
It's time to get a goodbye.
France borders Italy.
Simple numbers are like life, they are completely logical, but the rules for them cannot be discovered, even if you spend all your time thinking about them.

It happened today.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
All you have to do is sweep the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Show it to us.
There's nothing wrong with the plan.
Do good to those who hate you.
I'm going to finish this project.

The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm three years older than him.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place I could go.
The man pushed her aside.
One hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting for a bad expectation.
I hear Boston was nice this time of year.
What's your nickname?

Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He himself refused to talk to her.
This painting is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that pissed her off.
That's too little.
I've never seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was injured in the crash.
The question now is how.
I like to speak French.
Rumors of defeat were spreading.
It's very short.
Stop coming back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of being on time if everyone else is late?
The wind was blowing the rain right in my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear this?
I think you'll be happy.
That's no problem.
Did you leave a tip?
Looks like there's no one home.
I'm gonna have to decline that request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?

I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
Christmas is coming.
I intend to win.
Many of the children were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a hammal company to transfer their stuff to their new address.

Tom wasn't up for it.
This guide may be of use to you on your journey.
Is your watch true?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like gardening.
They've been chatting for more than two hours.
It's an honor to be here.

Have you seen Tom?
I took the first step.
Watch where you're going.

I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She read all my books herself.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I can see how confusing this is for you.

I have to admit, I was worried.
You don't seem very happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is an interesting occupation.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I don't gamble anymore.
It's my brother's.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom's got his shirt on.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look angry?

How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We arrived a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I can handle my savings.
What's ours is ours.

It's okay.
Tom won't be at the bank at the time.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Looks like you've made quite a success of the last time I saw you.
The station is in the middle of town.
Don't even bother coming.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like the way you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The subject is outside the scope of this investigation.
You're sitting in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.
Although I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget Tom doesn't understand French.

I found the key under the wiper.
From what I understand, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to think of a reason if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard you talking to Tom.
That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to pick up toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You need to work hard.
I don't feel good about this hat.
What's the minimum wage in South Africa?
It is on a diet because it is slightly overweight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You take something to drink, you break your elbows to the buffet, and you eat like a pig!
These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were dating Tom seriously.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't teach lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's got a crush on him.
I think what Tom did was really stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language bearer.
I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We immediately became friends.
Tom spent the weekend at his beach house.
Black suits you.
You know everything about me.
Let me think about it and I'll get back to you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me every once in a while.
Tom, check your pants pocket.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's really wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field produce?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
You're on the right track, you're on the wrong track.
Will you give me a light?
He drinks his coffee every time.
I don't have any information on Tom.
She found a job as a typist.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should've worked harder.
Her sweater's purple.
Now that I've registered, what do I have to do?
It's clear that Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a tickler.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
Yesterday was terribly cold.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were out of our minds.
I think you'll be happy.
The teenagers left.
I wish I was rich.
I'm just getting started.
If you need anything, just call me.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, I was wondering if my e-mail had even reached you.
She decided her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his toes.
His teaching method is both good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a little suitcase.
He witnessed the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing to do with the matter.
I love parties.
That's the camera I bought yesterday.
Short skirts are no longer fashionable.
I think we're gonna need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he was eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do it.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
You're good with green.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the beach.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
As old as you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the weather gonna be tomorrow?
Are there any kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom's sitting on a denarius.
The girls were dancing in the living room.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and I saw another town.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snoring.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned up his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good with everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
You're welcome again anytime.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I least trust.
Would you mind waiting outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director considered firing Tom, but he decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Bank.
Is it possible that it's love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom's got two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Traveling through southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom is lower than average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
Naita Tom, I don't know him that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is linked to national peculiarities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll look at you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom threw up.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The game was postponed for an unknown time.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken's arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do a lot of people go to museums?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming from the inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That Kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this book yours?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He lays down on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's a bad guy.
What's the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm shopping with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My dad rarely smokes.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wronged the address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I'm meeting him at lunch.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we need to get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran really fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know someone you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
Do you speak French, too?
I just started studying French recently, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no older than five years, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom has little hands.
He arrived two days early.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before we do.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I'm not gonna be able to get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's at Tom's now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists have arrived.
The door clicks and closes.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
Twin brothers look just like each other.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the smile.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's celebration.
It won't be just you there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm angry with myself.
This was done by Tom by hand.
You won't believe the things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much luggage when you travel.
I've got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're both working.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling around, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage over the others.
I screwed you up.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He played me in public.
The pear burned down.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Turn it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all thought Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I'm not feeling well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning how to swim on vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out so easily.
It's almost 5:30.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a shower.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered in snow.
One hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right by the beach, there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever sows the winds will reap the storms.
According to the latest census, the country's total population is just over 7 million people.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left my keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it for a while.
Is that all you got?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to submit to their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom has a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so shaky, I couldn't breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's not feeling very well.
Is Spot gone, too?
I promise I'll get him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a hat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
What do you say we study together at the library?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in effect.
Your shirt's missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
You're good with green.
Keep your fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working in the open.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom teaches French every day.
They're dealing with kitchen supplies in this store.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works at that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice may be coming.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Any of your crew speak French?
Looks like it's about to snow.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debates.
Eat one live frog every morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is on the rise.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to loosen up your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We teach French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please, have patience.
Your joke goes too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
Everybody's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wished he was still single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I had pizza every day last week.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You must be wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in the presence of his father.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's lunchtime.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
Your shirt's neck.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was alone at home.
In Esperanto, the essentials end up with a "o." A plural number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to become a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy the tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and see us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is a difficult language.
I didn't exactly feed myself.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at his hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at a time.
There's still no memory of Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awake at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom is much easier to speak in English than in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've already done my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
There's not much left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operated on in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom searched the drawer to see if there was any pens he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to know the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I'm not uncomfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You need to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained it in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process is producing good results.
That's what his ignorance is about.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is no good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We're gonna throw him a farewell party.
What club are you in?
Atsushi could have been sick.
Tom doesn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He graduated from Cambridge with an honor.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Does Tom study French at school?
What shoes are they?
We definitely worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay till tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'm gonna help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a website, just make sure you don't violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastic began his worthy undertaking.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more specific.
I'm on vacation this week.
You're wearing your socks first.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't speak French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I have no doubt of his sincerity.
Please open the package.
It's on me.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you mind telling me your name, please?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching your game?
This is your home.
The losses were severe for both sides.
I'll follow your orders.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time to leave.
She does makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak in French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my eyes look nice.
I don't have any money.
Milly eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are now demodes.
He's doing very well with children.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, it stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She wasn't doing much of a hint of what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
I study French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where'd you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some toxins used properly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it a secret.
You're making me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do this.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you hand me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just walk around like that, start molesting people's addresses.
I had a date at 2:30, but I got stuck in traffic, and I couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
It's been a long time for nothing.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you "stupid."
I'm in French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you fail, is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
It's a very interesting story for me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home on the bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Shake my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan has failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished my breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She's a grown-up.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared, don't worry.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves the silkworms live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
I'm in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's just started recovering.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in my lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend over their diseases.
I wouldn't think tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't had my dizzy spell yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm getting shit from the wreaths.
I can't do this alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and eventually everyone will find out.
She was cold.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the fair.
I thought it best if I didn't say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you looking closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the cutest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not being mean.
There's good food in this restaurant.
That's not what I do.
Are they confused?
You parked in my spot.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment is what they create.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a great poem.
Prices have fallen lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the checkpoint, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to carry Tom across the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me about this.
I grabbed the cat by the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were a lot of frogs in that pond.
I understand that perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry, you won't fix anything.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend is coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope that happens.
Maybe Miss Satou sent flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll wish!
I'm afraid I've touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's devoid of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put on these slippers, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
Next semester, I'll be studying French.
Tom's not giving a speech today.
I'll see you tonight!
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever works out the way you thought it would.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should obey their parents.
Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I think of him as my best friend.
No one answered the phone.
I've seen you before.
You're teaching the Esperant.
My new bike costs 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Save it till later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so shallow.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel went down because of the earthquake the other day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Shut the damn door!
We used to make fun of him.
John came in a week ago.
He turned down the offer, so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The barber is a man who shaves his beards and cuts men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom loved to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not being mean.
I'm the most ordinary office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out a way to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be there in time.
He often walks to school.
The socks stink.
When are they getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're so hot.
How many episodes of "Wan Pease" have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is there a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're both sweet and sweet.
My sister lives next door to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
That wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her T-shirt.
Hey, man, I'm asking you to spray some insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied that I had not responded to the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your luggage.
Soon after, it started raining.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
You don't want permits.
Tom sent Mary a message in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation's over, he says good-bye and wishes me a pleasant evening.
Let's check it out.
You've done a good job so far.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand up.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you dump them?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for class.
Let's find out what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this toilet.
You're on a winning streak.
I want a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The film wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be disturbed.
I don't think Tom's number is in the directory.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's got a crush on her after dinner.
These containers are sealed off hermetically.
He's the best player on our team.
I've seen you before.
There's none.
I want more information.
Do you carry a gun?
He says he avoided the danger of pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm coming out.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You need to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't get it.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was trembling with fear.
I was your mother's first friend.
The fight has ruined our unity.
How much money should I take with me?
Tom's good with French.
I'm into stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Whose socks are these?" "My sister's."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, tall blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His reproof told him not to eat between the main eating hours.
Any survivors?

I'm early.
Let's go to a private place.
Jesse immediately accepted the invitation.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.

Let's play Canadian.
I think we have enough time.

He was on a business trip.
I had a little fever this morning.
The medicine's working.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is this the right direction for the museum?
School starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breaths are healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We're out of our minds about you.
He can't read.
You're doing just fine.
The debates won't solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the newly learned words.
I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was wearing red shirts.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say "cheese."
Tom won't get paid.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the slope to the school, both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
That's all, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.

That's not gonna help you.

I wrote to my French teacher in French.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay till lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be pleased.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Then what's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave Mary's card.
I think you'd better stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I chose.
I think we're out of gas.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.

I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom might object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you'd better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide a good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.

I have plans tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't seem too surprised.
Obviously, it worked.
I need to teach Tom about this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped out the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you back.

Stay with me, Tom.

The movie wasn't as much fun as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of everything called the universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion about its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to get rid of this prison by extending the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living beings and nature in all and beauty.

Aren't you happy?
It might take some time.
I thought you might step aside.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What's Tom trying to accomplish?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we'd better go.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's parents were both teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's cloudy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after being away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we intrigued Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice Mary's age.
Mary has two girlfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have an infection of the gum.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need this anymore.
Put it back where it came from.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make that decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You're sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What did Ken eat?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
We're going to college next year.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom was having a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of sayings about DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the 20 students, only one read the book.
I've got work to do on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese tend to trust established authorities.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it on my own time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What kind of situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
Her presence makes me uncomfortable.
But he was allergic to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio back then.
She went to the museum with a taxi.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't have with.
It'll be good if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use dental floss.
We got here fast, because the movement wasn't loaded.
You have to be careful.
What do you miss?
He's recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those goggles are coming for you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
It doesn't feed until it's over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching the dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom's not gonna help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't work.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Uighur sentences in Tatoeb!
Tom's persistent.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut through here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind doesn't care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't bring him back yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press the Shift key.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are hanging without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go welcome him and in the meantime drop this letter.
This chicken hasn't laid a single egg lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom can't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You've got nice lips.
A lot of people are going to lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He came to my aid.
We'll start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's coming to an end.
The moment of glory for Hanshin did not last long. They were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Wouldn't that be a problem?
He's upset he's called a fool.
They're getting worse.
Do you really want this?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm a lucky girl.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I need to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the front of the kitchen window to cool it.
Happy is that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me some good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, that's too bad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good for the taste?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Aren't you intrigued?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start studying French?
She decided her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you dump them?
Tom, how's he going to handle the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I didn't talk to you before, did I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is a picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Go through that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
To a new meeting.
I'm exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistically.
I heard you cheering them up.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrasse and get off on Zestrase.
Laughing is good for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom that everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Defaults".
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs cast a great shadow.
When did the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I will not give in to threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's of use.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to hand over the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone bake a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Are you free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the highways are covered in ice.
We barely have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Get her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like a Frenchman.
I think we need to make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket box?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little carried away while I was dancing, and I climbed up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into a pound.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking on the rough road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is you.
She took the exam.
I'll study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made some mistakes on the exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get it off.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a grown man now.
Let's not lie to each other.
I'm better.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so receptive.
Have you heard of him?
She washed her shirt fast.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a single wish.
Please, tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time.
Men get in shape by riding a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend to me?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just squeeze your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep country.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken didn't run.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She was twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's on her way.
They long for the city's life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was running around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running around with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discussing it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw out those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say that.
He came after you left.
Have you had breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you do that?
I think you've had enough.
You told me that another time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't understand much of French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is spending a lot of electricity.
Don't get attached to this hunt propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be abolished.
First, the good God made the man, then made the woman, then he had mercy on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eyes.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from flatulence.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticism, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom had Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back to the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth pulled out last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key isn't in the lock.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned on the light again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got really angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with so many bad wreaths, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They're headed straight for their goal.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
Constancy is paid off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe Earth is being monitored by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't slow me down, I think.
I think you should let your beard go.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soft drink?
Many people share my view of the matter.
The blues are clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his big job at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court that must be filled, but a fire that must be set on fire.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Order the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl between the crowds.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English and I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter out of milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I wasn't serious about that.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you at all!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom set the engine on fire.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
You're making 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it out?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather has prevented us from leaving.
I'm learning French now.
Because I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a winning streak.
I can't be mad at you about this.
The distribution of television has greatly deprived us of our reading time.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't look in my closet.
The new coronary virus is highly contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here off the record.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toasted cup.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me very much.
It's forbidden to smoke in the school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people can talk well, others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone came in.
Tom's on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian too.
Japan has very distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I never should have let you do this alone.
Convicted of death.
I've only been waiting five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsch" and "shish" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees have been mutilated.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over 40.
Do you have the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is reborn.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid we can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I didn't talk to anyone today except Tom.
I can barely hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's not here.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's this all about?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're blocking.
She got a ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything there at all?
They were all at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it like you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much disease as lazy.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the film, it's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog is watching TV, too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He sometimes watches TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only thirty minutes left before the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't tease us so much.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That's not gonna make Tom understand anything.

He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to find out.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest medical innovations are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.

Bring me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Have you been in debt yet?
Will you teach me how to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
A coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have a choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put first the last name, then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was a pale reminder of his father's appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.

How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't bother them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has a drinking problem?

I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.

Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.

That book was easy.

I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot it.

Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something warm to drink.

Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom is very modest.
Thank you for that.
But balla nica, turkish panic, guidi vancho, our captain.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to enroll.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lotus leaf.
We are firmly convinced that when I make sentences, the author should avoid succumbing to the harmful habits inherent in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely unnecessary in light of the purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move," make your way and sit down.

I need to know.
When's it over?
I get sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.

God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's staying.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!

I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilos of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that near your house?

I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it hard to learn French?

Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around.
He's getting cold easy.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'll study Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's been silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like it.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better and better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an interrogation on the date of the exam.
Maybe we're missing the obvious.
Everyone's dying.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan almost every family has a laundry.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The crow has flown far away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I've had a lot of headaches.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, an unbeliever.
There's no way I'm not gonna make it to the meeting.
You always said hello with a gift.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.

Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll make it to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man's got to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very hot lately. My favorite football team is going west.
It was easy for me to get attached to sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a tongue bearer.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while there's still light.
Tom's hurt himself.
His room is a mess.
They spend some of their free time taking care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay three more days.
We've postponed leaving for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know its limits.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater on under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming real fast.
Add this site to "Defaults".
I have a lot to say about that.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what's bothering you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain, and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't home last night.
We're in danger.
You want to buy this skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French, too.
You're leaving?
Let's change the subject.
At school, it was very interesting.
They've booked the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been keeping my days in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruits.
It wasn't that funny.
It's either him or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing alone.
I'm playing in a band.
The birds were singing.
Tom gets off work at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
There will come a time when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they take the bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be punctual.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: whoever has the gold, he sets the rules.
The house is haunted.
Tom's going into town.
Everything that isn't forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the job to junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very pretty girl.
Tom can't do that.
Whatever you're doing, you can't make a person believe anything, even less yourself.
I don't feel so good.
The air conditioner's not working.
You're sitting in my seat.
Is there something that scares you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid 200 dollars in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
This won't happen again.
You're the reason I did it.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up that watch for a little while, and let's not even talk about breaking up with him permanently.
He didn't get the job.
I think you'll do just fine.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
I bathe every morning in the summer.
Buckle up your shirt.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruit to oranges.
This place deserves a visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I've told you this another time, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I took your book, until I left it, I was always laughing, and one day I'm going to start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's tight for the round.
And I've seen that.
The dolphin is a species of herring.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She decorated the room with beautiful furniture.
Pocket calculators can be purchased at the price of a pair of socks and are needed by thousands of British children at school, no less than pencil and rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
He'll provide you with all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around and bully people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm borrowing money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a chicken with no head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A couple of people went to the meeting.
He put on his coat and left the house.
Tatoeb's new site will slide a home hyper database, "built by the basics" search engine, and it will go to Dadebux-OS server with a daddy's CPU, made entirely by Dadeby.
Her old man got in the way.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it a lot.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During the holiday, I read all Milton's papers.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked a question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Which is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as little.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden have died.
They made us work all day.
We elected him president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What's the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
This species is in danger.
I think you'd better lie down.
I like you very much.
I rang the bell.
The wolves are moving on packs.
Do you have any medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's a friend of mine.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved significantly towards what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
I finally saw you. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little bit more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to study things.
So we're all in agreement.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna be a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in at 9:00?
Let's synchronize our clocks.
I market every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a duty-free shop?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
I wish I'd told you, Kelface.
This is the camera Tom took the photos with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you think you want something else.
It looks like a man from a distance.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was granted the right to appeal.
Let's not rush.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to jump to conclusions.
Don't worry.
He's given up.
The wine is the milk of the adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Oove!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deep asleep.
She used to call him anyway.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether we should cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were irrigated by the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Kids are the flowers of our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep moving.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll make it in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodyguard.
The man eats bread.
He's crossing the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone mediocre sent a message to a bottle, it was just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sent a message to a bottle, the fate of a whole country was at stake.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
Kids play Dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition has continued to improve.
Does Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking his coat off.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
The way he works, there's nothing to be commended for.
