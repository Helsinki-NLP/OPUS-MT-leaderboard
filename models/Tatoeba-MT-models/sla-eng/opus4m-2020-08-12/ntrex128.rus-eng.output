Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “go to the maps”
Among some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to adopt the MWP Abbreviation is gratifying.
The challenge was to change the Assembly's name to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this acronym.
One Labourist, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new acronym “reefed Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers not from Wales: in Vallian twp means "tupica", and pwp means "kakaka".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole remained “unsatisfied” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new acronym, but note that MWP is close to writing Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in Valiant is pronounced about as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a change of title law, made the following statement: “The final decision on what the members of the Assembly will be called will, of course, remain behind.”
The Wales Governance Act 2017 empowers the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options under which the Parliament of Wales instead of the Assembly found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while MWP received the highest public support.
Members of the Assembly appear to offer other options, but it will not be easy for the presiding member, Elin Jones, to find an all-increasing solution; it will be recalled that the draft amendment law should be submitted in a few weeks.
The reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on the change of name
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the accession of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on change of title, said he was not going to recognize his results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change in the name of the country is the whole price of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in Harlem's arrivals: St. Martin's colloquial was forever silenced
“The guards in the area I was talking to said that there had been bars and churches on every corner before, ” says Adams.
“And now there is none left.”
The disappearance of bars is still understandable:
“The form of communication has changed”.
“At least he stopped being a guest of the whole area where they came regularly.”
But with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the funds received from the sale of assets will be sufficient for a short time, however their leaders may hope. “In the morning or later, they will remain with nothing.”
At the church site, he added, there would be a multi-housing house whose residents would hardly support the incomes that had been preserved in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams believes. “This will be the day when such churches will finally close because the new neighbours will never become their adherents.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black region: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin 10 years later.
The first adherents of the Methodist Church left the scene in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black arrival in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's church was moved into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main trading artery of Harlem, where they refused to take up jobs or raise blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged as a result of the fire, and during the reconstruction work, the residents of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who replaced him in the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly called the carillon “wheels for the poor. ”
But the expert who tried carillon in July called it “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
The expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was St. Martin's church that was the world's first instrument played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriuezer, St. Martin's church still has no replacement.
Over the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has faced a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Church.
The meeting was attended by the governing body, which included secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to shift the cost of work” to the congregation, although the latter had nothing to do with the selection of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some visitors expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a 13-year-old diver who was working on lobbying was injured by a shark
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel said in an interview with the station KSWB-TV (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning, and within half an hour, he heard the boy screams about help.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was so excited about taking the lobby, but quickly “he offered to scream, ‘ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
As he sailed to the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had completely torn his skin around the lock. ”
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘Here’s the shark!’ says Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Reddy Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, told the press that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in this place but was not considered dangerous.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Heils noted that 135 species of sharks exist in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinesbury plans to conquer Britain's perfume-cosmetic market
Seinesbury is planning to set up cosmetics and perfumery departments in Buts, Super Drag and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists, a model of luxury universities.
The British perfumed cosmetic market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterling and continues to expand, while in fashion and goods for the house of sale it is falling. In order to capture a significant proportion of the desired market as an experiment in 11 shops across the country, there will be large-scale cosmetics and perfumery departments, and if they succeed next year they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking to fill up the shelves previously placed on TV, microwave ovens, home goods, and investments in the perfumed cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Saintesbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially selected locations, by the type of product organization in the Buts stores.
In addition, a company ambulance of Boutique Cosmetics products will be reorganized with the introduction of vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two Seinesbury stores will feature perfume producers' kiosks, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Sally Oake, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small benches near the house led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Seinesbury, says that outlets will gradually turn into trade fairs, and his supermarket network fights for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidle, offering more services and non-food products.
Hundreds of supermarkets have Argos outposts, and some of them can now be found in Habitats since the network acquired both brands two years ago, which has resulted in increased sales of food products and proceeds from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinesbury and Buts was organized, but in the future, there was disagreement between the participants about the division of income from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinesbury pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) by Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Farmassi, over 125 million pounds of sterling three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxury leather care facilities to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Seinesbury: "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfumery and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to assist the Council.
Our brand range for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a brand new concept of shopping”.
Peter Jones "angry" responded to Holly Willoughby's 11 million-pound deal.
The star of the Logo Dragon show, Peter Jones, was "angered" by the release of the lead Holly Willoughby from a £11 million deal she was planning to make with Peter's Lifestyle brand, but instead she preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was compared to Goop's actresses, Guineat Peltrow.
The 37-year-old lead programme, “This morning”, announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has led to the anger of Peter Jones, the star of "The Dragon's Log".
According to our sources, Jones was “enraged” when a teleseller's favorite at a tense meeting held at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, admitted that when new contracts were concluded, she would not have enough time for their common brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
Their brand was compared to that of the child actresses, Guinet Peltrow, a Goop brand, and it was expected that its sales would double Willowby's condition, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old leader announced her departure in Instagram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane towards one of his villas.
According to one source, “the Truly brand was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure its carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision had led all parties to the deal.
Everyone was stunned by the fact that Tuesday was still a week before the stamp was launched.
A whole warehouse filled with ready-to-sale goods remained at Marlowe headquarters.”
Experts believe that the departure of Britain’s most popular star, this morning, could cost the company millions of pounds of sterling due to significant investments in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, and the potential delay in starting the line.
In addition, it is about breaking up long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years now.
Willoughby created a Truly brand with Tara Kepp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and Johns owns 40 percent of Dan Baldwin's shares.
Willoughby will be Ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony McPartlin as the lead broadcaster of the ITV "I am a celebrity".
A source from the nearby area of Jones said last night, “We cannot comment on his business.”
Complicated negotiations, “and then we loved each other”
He joked about the criticism that the media would be subjected to because of the “indecent president” of the commentary and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the leader's voice.
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim Chen-Yun was interested in the reunion after Trump had called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Lee Young Ho addressed the world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting Saturday, stating that North Korea was still awaiting “responsible responses” from the United States following the initial disarmament measures of the DPRK.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continued to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“With North Korea, things are going great,” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish a relationship with Kim Chen Ying have yielded fruit: missile tests have been put to an end, hostages have been released, and US soldiers who remain in the DPRK have also returned to their homeland.
With regard to his relationship with Kim Chen Ying, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“Be content with the President so easily, but then instead of the 10,000 people on the street who are breaking into this completely destroyed hall, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd that was coming before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: disaster destruction recorded, victims calculated by hundreds
In the first days of the Lombok earthquake, a foreign NGO said that there was no need for them.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population had lost their roofs over their heads, the Government did not feel it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that international support is not needed, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, but we do not yet know whether a foreign group can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palo to determine whether international organizations are appropriate.
Given the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horribly ill prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters from tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami threat, there was no siren in Palu to alert the population, most likely leading to so many casualties.
Transport between the many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously housed in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palo, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s country infrastructure the main point of his election campaign and spent incurable funds on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has become mired in funding problems.
The President is also criticized for increasing interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were left homeless as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other crossbows.

The monument to Cromwell in front of Parliament sparked a heated discussion on “rewriting history”
Cromwell's “banishment” would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts by its followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Remembrance Society referred to Mr. Creek's proposal as “mixing” and “trying to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated: “In the ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell's statue arose inevitably in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the economic movement during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Torncroft reflects the views of his 19th century contemporaries and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate by professionals.
But it can be argued with confidence that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve great appreciation and respect.”
A Chinese farmer killed by a murderous pig
In one of the markets in South-West China, a farmer was the victim of a pig, local media reports.
The victim's bloody body (the media only mentions his name, Yuan), with a severed artery, was found near the barn in the market in Lupanshuy Province of Guizhou in southern China, reported by Morning Post on Sunday.
The pigdog is preparing to inoculate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005, Sinin District of China, Qinghai Province.
Juan and his cousin arrived from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered Yuan’s breathless body, and the door to a nearby pigsty was opened.
There was a huge hamster in the pigsty with blood on it.
A forensic examination found that a 250-pound pig had killed a farmer.
“My brother’s legs have been bled and mutilated, ” reports the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The murderous pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate investigation team to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration on compensation for the death of the farmer.
Pig attacks are uncommon.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., seriously traumatized a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal lured a Valiant peasant into a tractor and released him, only scared of his wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon, U.S.A., was eaten by his own pigs. As reported by CBC News, a Canadian farmer, usually pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect their hidden aggression as a “dropping mechanism”.
"Pigs of game,
They're biting and very curious, but they have no intention of offending you.
You should simply instill in your animals a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring storms to much of the south-west of the United States
It is projected that Hurricane Rosa is losing power by moving through a zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days it will bring torrential and floods to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached the 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the hurricane will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific, heading east to the west coast of the United States, near the coast of Lower California, and the storm will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Heavy tides are expected in the coming days in the South-West due to the tropical humidity that hit the emerging low-pressure zone.
Precipitation from 2.5 cm to 10 cm will result in dangerous floods of rain, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, precipitation can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the South-West of the United States, mostly in most of the Arizona area, precipitation is expected to be between 5 cm and 10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
At the current risk of a tropical rainstorm, pedestrian walks in the desert are seriously affected.
Livins can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms can cause violent winds and dust clouds to rise.
As the low - pressure zone rises, the tides on the coast of southern California will collapse.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small mud flow and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and mornings, tropical rains will take place in Arizona on Monday evenings and Tuesday mornings.
By Tuesday, the tides will be in the Four Corners area and extended until Wednesday evening.
In October, temperatures will drop sharply throughout the U.S., due to low Arctic air temperatures at relatively high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly noticeable in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the United States central and eastern territories, warm weather is expected to reach 27 degrees Fahrenheit in the area from the South plains to the North-East of the country in early October.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an extremely high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by mid-October.
Senate hearings in the case of Judge Brett Cavanaugh saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, caught the attention of over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to Kavanaugh ' s claim was met with an unexpected continuation, and an urgent announcement was made to the media on Friday: the republican Jeff Flake made a condition that the charges against the lawyer would be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated in the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was “100 per cent” convinced that Cavanaugh had attacked her intoxicatingly and tried to undress her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave emotional testimony, saying that he was 100 per cent convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, Friday's debates saw more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
Moreover, Nielsen’s ratings do not always include viewers watching TV at work.
In comparison, it is an average audience following an American football match in the playoffs or an Oscar ceremony.
The biggest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leading audience warmly supported Kavanaugh's appointment: Senate hearings that lasted all day had an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Second, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS auditorium was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After hearing, interest in the matter did not weaken.
On Friday, a real drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After the senator from Arizona, considered a moderate republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh's candidature, CNN and CBS television channels were able to seal the camera, as on Friday morning on the way to the Flake Legal Committee's meeting, Flake met in the elevator with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him, with his eyes down, getting a buzz from angry women on live CNN.
"I am standing before you," said one of them.
“Do you think he is telling the country the truth?”
“Behind you, the power, while so many women are powerless”, they tried to explain their position to the woman.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement, and he would comment on it at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed by hiding the senator from the cameras everywhere.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Cavanaugh's candidature as a judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast a live broadcast.
However, Flake made one condition: the FBI's investigation into the charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flake claims to have changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats of Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
The Flake decision was having an effect, as it was evident that Republicans lacked votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of “political games” of the situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests ahead of society.
The British Prime Minister attends the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published in a May interview tape, former M.I.D. head Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Chess Plan in the framework of Brexit, stating that the introduction of customs duties between Great Britain and the EU was “absolutely ridiculous”.
Wade Simms' death in a shoot-out: Police arrested Datheon Simpson for suspected murder of the University of Louisiana forward
Police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Datheon Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
The police published a video of a fight involving Simms and Simpson, where Simms lost his points.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on the spot found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to hurting Wade dead.
According to the Advocate, a $350,000 deposit has been made for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday: death was caused by a cross-sectional gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Criminal Investigation Division of Louisiana State Police, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents who helped carry out the search and search activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement force for their “faithful work on the capture of a criminal”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter front was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played in the Louisiana State University team.
In the past season, Simms scored 5.6 points and scored 2.6 points on average for a match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement Friday morning, saying that Wade Simms' tragic death caused shock and "the present woe" to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” added the coach.
The volcano covered Mexico City with ash
Volcano Popocatepetl fell asleep in the ashes of the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population stay away from the volcano, with activity recorded in its crater and 183 gas emissions per day.
According to the Centre’s observations, there was often a squawk and a shiver in the vicinity of the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photos of frontal glass cars covered with a thin layer of ash.
After the 7.1 Mw earthquake, which shook the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousands of rallies were held in Barcelona to commemorate the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps.
Police officers have narrowed down protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, have thrown away their eggs and powdered paint, raising the cloud of dark dust in the very centre of Barcelona.
The riots resumed with renewed force after the police launched a gang - containing canopy.
For several hours, the supporters of independence chanted, “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” and their opponents replied with the slogan “Let Spain Hail!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were hospitalized with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized as illegal by the Spanish Government, but as an important milestone for separatists.
The Catalonia voted in favour of leaving Spain, but the phenomenon was low because the opponents of the exit were mostly boycotted by the referendum.
According to Catalonian official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block a referendum at the country ' s polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists stayed overnight on the declared path to follow the demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it.
The demonstration still took place, but it took another route.
A 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who attended a separatist rally in his wife's company, suggested that the hope of acquiring sovereignty by Catalonia was becoming more and more rigid.
“Last year there was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents cried out of happiness when they got the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a suspended state," he says.
In the recent December elections to the local authorities, the Catalonian parties in favour of the separation from Spain have won an important victory, even with a small splinter, but this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the known leaders of the movement are either in running or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a police rally on the phone, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing”, he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalonian separatists who had been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next European Parliament election as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: The car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the Londonberry houses was packed with a car several times; men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested.
The visit took place on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m. local time, in the Ballinagard Kresent area.
As a result, the ram damaged the gate and the building itself, reports criminal police inspector Bob Blammings.
There are reports that a bow shot could have been fired in the car.
Livingstone's victory over Rangers thanks to Mengi's goal.
Dolly Mengi's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to Livingstone
He won an unexpected victory over the Rangers, and for the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, it was only a second defeat for 18 games.
The exact hit of Dolly Mengi leveled Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian Club in the starting table, where they split the second place.
The Gerard Club was left without a victory on its trip this season of the Premier League, and on Sunday they have a meeting with the group leaders, Harts, from which Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, Rangers will host a match of the League of Europe with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
The Livingston Club continues its win-win series in Division by playing six matches and not having been defeated since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missing moments for Livingstone in a struggle with hardworking guests
Hot coach Holt had to keep an account from the very beginning — the Rangers clearly failed to cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt failed, and then defender Alan Lithgo, swinging too wide, couldn't stop Kaj Halkett's ball from falling into the net.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of their defense line, hoping for dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That's how they missed that important goal.
Rangers gave up a free shot, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transmission to Menge, who killed from a central position.
By then, Rangers had the advantage of owning the ball, but the protection of the host team was unbreakable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time period continued on the same schedule, although Kelly still had to take a hit from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers' Gateman Allan McGreggord pulled the ball off Scott Pittman, and Lithgo made a wide submission from the standard position.
Balls were constantly caught in Livingstone's fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and two penultimonial requirements — one for provoking Glenn Middleton Halkett, the other for playing hand — were not met.
“Phenomenal” game, Livingstone - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and an excellent result for Livingstone.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their rise to the football Olympics.
Their style of play and composition have hardly changed since they came up to the top lines of the ranking, and the great merit of Coach Holt was that he had mobilized the team from the beginning.
He had a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett ran a perfectly organized defense, and Menga wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall down.
At the same time, Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
Although they had a good game with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't live up to our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they lacked ownership of the ball, and they only managed to get through the protection of the host team once. Rangers, who went down in the middle of the table, has something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was great weather, and both of them were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries — a visit already involving some conflicts.
The Heads of State could not understand such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s EU accession.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of the huge new mosque.
Cologne has the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police refused to allow a 25-thousand crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters were placed nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including Kurds, also gathered to condemn in full both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German Government to invite him to Germany.
The existence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguity of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Car collision led to the death of a cyclist
In London, a cyclist died at the scene.
The accident took place near Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a lively intersection in the south-eastern part of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver and the paramedics on the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: only a half mile from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London Police report that work is currently under way to identify the deceased and notify his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads and bus routes have been blocked at the scene: drivers are asked not to enter the area.
riots in Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured during the riots committed in a masculine prison.
The men ' s prison of the strict Long Lartin (Wustershire) regime has continued since Sunday, riots that have occurred around 9:30 local time.
To suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, an opera group, Tornado, was called.
Police officers suffered minor injuries to the soft tissue of the person; medical care was provided on the spot.
According to the official prison representative, “specially trained staff were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and that their measure of suppression can be changed for a longer period.”
Long Lartin currently has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized and attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the prison administration was forced to recruit special-purpose units to calm the violent prisoners who threw billiards at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa can sink Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the zone of intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is lucky: early next week Hurricane Rosa, having made the last tear, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and bring the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cross a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and spill in the rain on Monday evening.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) came 65 kilometres from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest projections of the National Meteorological Service, it will drop from 5 cm to 10 cm in precipitation, reaching 15 cm on the Arizona plateau of Mogolon-Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Bassein, it is possible to drop up to 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with precipitation reaching 10 cm.
For areas where torrential flows will pass, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, for the region has long suffered from drought.
Although floods may pose a danger, heavy rains can facilitate a dry season that does not take place in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 per cent of Arizona’s territory has a severe drought (second by severity)”, reports the weather.com website.
First, Hurricane Rosa will attack the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, with a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane is in a more cool zone on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some parts of Mexico, flood-prone floods are expected to take place.
“In the territory from lower California to north-west, Sonorah may fall to 7-10 cm of rainfall, up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and arrive early Tuesday morning at the Arizona border in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to the south of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the heavy rainstorms in Lower California, north-west of Sonora and in the desert areas of the south-west of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
Precipitation is expected to result in dangerous floods of rain, mudlides in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Assault in Midsomer Norton: four suspects in attempted murder are detained
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was severely stabbed and three adolescents and a 20-year-old boy were suspected of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the area of Excelsior Terras, Midsomer Norton, about 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset District Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime with any video of the crime that occurred on the cell phone.
Donald Trump: "On Cavanaugh, all hatred, all evil" by the Democrats "fell down"
“The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” said Trump at a rally of his associates in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving Cavanaugh's nomination as a candidate, “all hatred, all malice” of the Democratic Party has collapsed.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified to the U.S. Congress by categorically rejecting Cristina Blazi Ford's accusation that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and courage” Kavanaugh.
“The vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh’s approval is a vote in favour of the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unstinted public service list”, the president announced to a crowd of his associates in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly addressed the issue of the nomination of Kavanaugh, referring to the importance of the Republican election to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“There are only five weeks left before the most important elections in our lives.
I will not participate in them, but I will participate in the race in another sense," he said.
“I wear as a burnt offering and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves “to give us all the strength to resist”.
As a rule, the first key vote in the Senate on the approval of Kavanaugh's candidature should take place no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party said.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many had been swept away by giant waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the event were hundreds of visitors to a beach festival in Palu, and on Friday, on the west coast, waves reached a height of nearly six metres, which allowed everyone to travel and caused the immediate death of many of the present.
Tsunami followed the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of fleeing immediately and lost their lives as a result of it,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Office for Disaster Management at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come with one thing, there were cars, logs, whole houses, the elements destroyed everything in their path,” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its might.
Some of those present took to the trees that saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial survey of the disaster management shows destroyed houses, shops, bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground traffic.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the Territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement of the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) states that the earthquake-induced energy emissions were about 200 times higher than the explosion of an atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected from the geographical position of the city at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “scaled”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; 540 people were injured, and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destruction could be even greater along the coast to 300 km from Palo, in the area of Dungal, which was closer to the earthquake.
Communications from Dungal were “completely destroyed, no information received”.
“There are over 300,000 people living in the Dungal area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a limit,” the report said.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized for failing to report the arrival of the tsunami in Palo, but authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in effect.
In social networks, there was a love video in which a man on the top floor of a building screams at the approaching tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the shore, carrying all the houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and the tsunami have resulted in a major depletion of the power lines, which has made it very difficult for Palo to communicate with the rescue services.
Military transport aircraft with humanitarian assistance were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacked food and necessities, government sources reported.
The city's airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's a very bad situation.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where the staff found shelter in the tarpaulin tents that were broken down in the courtyard of their office building.
“They have seen a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
It's a very bad situation.
Charities have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that experts from international NGOs have failed to reach Palu.
Indonesian legislation allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the disaster site has been declared a zone of national disaster.
That's not what happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster, ” reports Aulia Ariani, Spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares natural disasters national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but for the time being the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Palo, friends and relatives of people who are missing still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will bring the population back to the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers pulled a woman from the wreckage of the building, who spent two days there, near her mother's breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the National Paraplannerism Assembly of Indonesia, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped at the Roa Roe Hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
"I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive," he said.
Hendon recalls how, after learning of the destruction of Ro's hotel from other paraplanners, he was desperate to reach out to his colleagues from Palo during the beach festival for the next hours.
However, his messages were depicted with one gray twig, not two blue ones.
“This means that the communications have not been delivered”, he believes.
Insolent theft of $26,750 during the maintenance of an ATM in Newport-on-Libya
On Friday morning, the perp kidnapped $26,750 from an incaster named Brink's, who was supplying an ATM in Newport-on-Libya, says the Newport Police Press Release.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored van was taking cash from an ATM in an entertainment complex and was about to fill it with new bills.
At that time, “a malicious man ran to Brink's from behind and stole a bag of ATM bills.
Several suspects were reported to have escaped from the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information on these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Yes.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: “A person formerly known as Kanye West”.
41-year-old West has long worn this alias and even named it his eighth album, which was released in June.
News of this occurred in advance of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will act as co-conspirators instead of Ariana, who cancelled her participation because of “emotional experiences”, the author reports.
West had previously stated that the alias was not only a reduced version of his name, but also a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’, ‘you’, ” so West explained the title of his album in one of the recent interviews with Radio Major Big Boy.
"So it's me, it's you, it's me.
At first it was Kanye, which means “one, ” and now I am only Yes, that is, reflecting all the good, bad, misunderstood in us, just at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Kanye is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Daddy, P. Diddi or simply Diddi, this year asked to call himself Love or Brazza Love.
Westo's rapper J.Z. changed his name a few times too, with or without defiance, spelling, or verse.
President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against civilians
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, President López Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, during a peaceful demonstration, the students were given their first shots at the crowd and the slaughter began, killing 300 people, against the backdrop of the strengthening of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth through a monthly scholarship to study and the opening of more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for learning have led young people to a criminal world.
Funding for the development of IIs needed to be doubled
China and its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence (II) should not be underestimated — the United States should double its investment in its scientific development, according to Li Kaifou, investor and entrepreneur in the area of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries had previously made statements on II work, although the US as a whole did not have a clear strategy for the development of II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in the innovations of II by 2030.
“Increase in the budget for II research would be a good start twice, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in II,” says Lee.
The increase in funding may double the chances that the next major achievement of II will be made in the United States, said Li CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superstate of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in U.S. Otello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government process competitions, such as Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that is absorbing academic leaders, it is corporations,” Lee is convinced.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Li is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan for the development of the next generation ' s artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding similar to that of the National Science Fund and other governmental organizations providing money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, claims Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should be attended by industrial and scientific partners, and the White House announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced investing $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, he is currently investing more than $100 million a year in II research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation, which had sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, had not taken any action in that direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia on Sunday, allowing for the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, consisting of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on its territory and vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter appearance would be at the minimum of 50 per cent necessary for the referendum.
The question raised in the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of Macedonia’s youth so that it could live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
A change of title would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1:00.
However, the trend was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dusko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for her joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kwardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, setting the chairs in front of tents established by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and EU membership, but we want to join in with a high-level head rather than breaking the thresholds of the cabinets,” says Kavadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment in Macedonia, which was so much needed by the country, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the guarantee of our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, but that was below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this amount is said to be a positive vote.
For the referendum to take place, the appearance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, is missing Brayton's protection to score goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke out with Brayton's protection, bringing Manchester City to victory with a score of 2:0 on Saturday at Texhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal for 65 minutes, it didn't seem like he had any trouble.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passport in the center of the field.
He raced between three Brayton defenders before breaking out into open space.
Aguero is surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and overran several others at the edge of the Brighton Penal Zone.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, in the penal zone, returned the Aguero ball to the right leg of Matthew Ryan's goalkeeper to the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero is having some problems with his legs,” said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored the goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Heavenly Blues the original advantage in fighting the Premier League.
That goal was scored for the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, deep inside Brayton
He gave an excellent incision to the left flank in Leroy San.
Sanne made a few touches before handing Sterling over to the remote.
The attacker of the Heavenly Blue put a ball in the gate just before he left the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim in the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to pick up points from Colorado Rockiz.
After Washington Nationals left the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Scherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockiz on Sunday, but only if the Roquiz, which is ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, starts to have problems in the playoffs.
The 5-2 victory over Nationals on Friday evening, Rokiz, has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to win the title in the first division.
“Although we play just like that, but at least we can keep our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss such a thing?"
Nescionals has not yet announced the pitcher on Sunday, but according to the latest data, it is likely that in the current situation, Sherzer would be willing to play this role.
Sherzer, going out on the 34th game, threw a ball at the pitcher's pitch on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he's going to be a pitcher.
Statistics of the right-wing pitcher Washington – 18-7 with ERA 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
The tramp conducts a pre-election race in West Virginia
With regard to the importance of the presence of Republicans in the interim elections, the President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate nominated by the President of the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was on the map in November.
Five weeks left before one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is very, very important. I do not run, although I do run around fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means are needed, and we are seeing vileness and abomination.
They don't care who they insult, who they have to go through to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give them to them.”
The Democrats, he alleges, have set the goal of “opposing and obstructing”.
"And you have seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats “evil, evil, imaginative and false.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, mentioning the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud voices from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to leak?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no, the language of the body has betrayed it, and I have never seen the language of the body so contradict the words.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with differing views.
It does not tolerate those who express their views
When momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of mistrust to me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a number of members of Parliament from a Labour party, to whom we have not yet been said that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
Similarly to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my lack of confidence in Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe — in the irony of fate — are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly said on Friday that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time I spent eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening Friday GC meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that the Labour Party does not differ in views is becoming more and more apparent and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be more similar to my own began to expect me to fundamentally change my views and take positions that I would never agree with — whether national security or the EU single market.
Every time I give a public statement — no matter what I say — there is a tirade of insults on social networks calling for the abolition of elections condemning the centre's policy or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am fortunateer than some of my colleagues, because my comments still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily attacks on sexual or racist soil, but who never retreat.
The most disappointing thing about this policy is that this number of insults has become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with every vote of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party is already becoming.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling for me to sit quietly and cut back, and then I will be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago, as a student of the school, outraged by the Government of Thatcher, which has led my school class to literally break up, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most — whether the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, and I haven't done that in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which will be a guarantee of economic, industrial and State damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labourists or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancelling the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I consider necessary for your benefit.

Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Air comes first
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result a little bit, but, doubtless, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Tennant Premier League.
Now they're heading the table, the only unbeatable team of tens.
After all, thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Mercy the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve,” said Peter Mercy.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth paying tribute to the Air, they've done better than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Freser Klimo led Air forward, but the yellow card released for the Voriors game by Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott caught an unfulfilled attempt.
Klimo increased the “E” break from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, earning a score, and then during the break he carried out a solo attempt to score 17-5 in favour of “Er”.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to make it through Baggott reduced the cut to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruard Knott, who was stretched out, and after his re-entry, Air moved on with the attempt by Stafford McDowell, who was executed by Klimo.
Acting Captain Blair McPherson then received the yellow card, and again Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's failed attempt at the end of the period of fierce pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card to intercept Klimo without a ball from the penalty line, McFerson made a touchdown behind the coming Air Molar.
Klimo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the very exit, after Kyle Rowe had been struck by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacking Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the masters of the field.
The Still Game star is about to start a new career in the restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kieran star is about to start working in the hotel industry, and it has become known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC screenplay he writes to, and he's filming along with a long-time comedy partner named Greg Hemfill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and it looks like Kirnan's planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to participate in the “a thriving restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia's landlocked hope is that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are hanging on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: “Our sea is right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, landlocked, there is still a memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the 19th-century bloody conflict because of resources; alive and eager to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have become the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision to be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and balance and, of course, there is a positive outcome here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's statement that Chile is under an obligation after decades of intense negotiations to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is fighting a difficult battle for re-election next year, also looks forward to the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and if so, that will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to rule Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not influence the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case “was not difficult, ” says Pas Zaraté, Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, Bolivia’s case has not progressed, but it has been postponed.
“The current administration of Bolivia has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” says Zarata.
According to her, Morales ’ military rhetoric destroyed Chile’s latest benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Welce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court ' s decision had been rendered too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit”, he claims.
Kalzadila also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the naval problem as a political player.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is once again an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not be until it can trust the United States
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, declares that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit among the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resumption of stalemate nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Ying.
Ri claims: The long-term sanctions and the U.S. objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees is utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Phoenician takes substantial steps on disarmament first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Phenyan is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive headwear that promises to appear in mass sales and will carry them right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headwear as part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their knock-offs to the podium.
A distinguished copy of Valentino: The main beige suit, decorated with broad fields of feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included jeweled orbs, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all of these headgear are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also presented the world with a collection of fascinating masks, which had to be very early on Halloween.
Many of these pestra masks had their mouths sewn up, and they looked more like the portrait of Hannibal Lector than the work of the curls.
One was like an underwater swimming gear with a tube and protective glasses, and the other was a melting ice cream.
If you're a high-end fan, you're lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into mass sales — right to you.
The hats of great size go on the heels of La Bomba, a two-foot straw hat with two feet wide, which everyone was wearing, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult label, which produced this extremely impractical hat, which gained such popularity on social networks, gave birth and sent to walk on the platform another huge accessory — a straw beach bag, almost as large as the same size as the swimsuit’s own model carrying the bag.
The orange bag from the red-hot bench with the white leather handle and the white-skinned sleeve of the raft became a bright copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage relates the publication F EMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale next summer. Since the designer has made such fur with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of excellent education, which was confirmed once again in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations have demonstrated individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other relevant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, and they seek to provide a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for the further attainment of the higher education they have chosen, as well as the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call to his understanding.
If you speak to him in his own language, you turn to him in your heart."
This is a convincing testimony that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations with and trust the citizens of other countries.
The results of the recent examinations this year show that languages take the lead in league tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the “A” award.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese), while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
At present, language subjects are used in the same way as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent school curricula and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacancies were language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a guarantee of a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, he will in the future gain a real advantage by acquiring another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages competitive advantages.
According to a survey by YouGov involving over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well enough in the foreign language to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage, with 15 per cent of respondents speaking it.
That is why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, would give children more opportunities to find good work.
In schools in Scotland, there is a wide variety of languages taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important for Britain in the light of the country ' s future development by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice from several languages with teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scotland ' s independent schools are seeking to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in the global business environment in terms of the future development of the country, so this should be adequately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice to ensure diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The familiar expectation of the fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-season Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still needs to know how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight”, Walton replied on the Lakers official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on Lakers.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
West Virginia Trump electoral race, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including his visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the candidate proposed to him as the Supreme Judge has been postponed, Trump seeks support in the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you look at it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will be held at 19:00 Eastern time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on YouTube.
The tramp will probably speak at this week's hearings to place its candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, in the position of supreme judge, and the proposal by Trump has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Cavanaugh has been accused of sexual harassment, and the vote that should have taken place in the Senate will be postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this action is to help the November elections to increase the election rate.
Thus, President Trump's campaign is aimed at helping these five meetings, which are due next week, to “energize volunteers and supporters, since Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” writes Reuters.
“Controlling the Congress is so important to its agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible because we are entering a tense season of pre-election agitation,” says Trump, press secretary for the pre-election campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
Wesbanco Arena in Wiling today can attract supporters from “... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the media attention to Pittsburgh, ” reports West Virginia Metro News.
A visit to West Virginia by Trump on this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, because this is where it received an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind as a result of interviews.
“This is the fact that in order for Morris to get ahead of the contestants, the President must come — a bad sign for Morrisi himself, ” says Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (cited from Reuters).
Ryder's Cup 2018: The United States of America shows a willingness to fight and hopes on Sunday for couples' competitions
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday's two-to-two game may have been exactly what Ryder's Cup needed.
The transition initiative is an extremely inventive sports concept, but it is what players believe in, and it is particularly pronounced in such competitions.
So who's got the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now they had four, so I think it’s a little initiative for us,” said Jordan Spit.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage and another twelve on the line.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel the “wind in the sails” and have reason to keep the spirit high, not least because of the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas playing together all day long, and anyone can boast of three points of four.
The sleep was unstoppable from you to the green, rather than a personal example.
The winning voices grew louder as his round continued, pushing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas stepped two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory at the 15th hole, was met with a similar voice, one of those who spoke of his belief in the chance for the American team.
“We need to get together and focus on our own games,” said Spit.
That's all the players have left now.
Go through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, who have undoubtedly been in the history of Ryder’s Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't recruit a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the inhospitable sick, builds faith in the fact that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the Le Golf National horizon, there will be no more famous player who has strengthened Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both on different holes at the same time.
However, it is still premature to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was with Alex Noreen.
Boggie and two double gods on the first nine holes dug a Spanish man and a Swede hole from which they could never get out.
So no one will help you get out of your pit on Sunday.
It is so fascinating to watch a four-ball game and a four-player game because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange and who deliberately silence, and how the strategy can change into a single moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and has fared a long way on the last day, but this session of the Quartet has also shown that the United States of America has all the strength to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubts.
On the final day, Ryder's Cup Europe is running an account of 10-6
Europe will receive a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the end of the four-ball Saturday and four-ball games, with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duet by Tommy Flytwood and Francesco Molinari, he led the fight against two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wished to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the making of a mistake by the American team in four games in the morning, winning with a score of 3-1.
The US has more resistance in fours, winning two matches, but they have not been able to narrow the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's command requires eight points out of the 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, while he and Mollywood, named after the sensational weekends, became only the second couple to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then made a great team to win the fallen spirit of Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Decebmo with an even more determined 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday games, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 out of 29 games in four games and the four in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the four-ball game in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson on Thursday, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepke with a score of 2/1, the world's first and third.
For Europe, the game has not become an easy and enjoyable stroll south-west of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas made two points Saturday for the Americans.
They won a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ayan Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to play Polter and Rory McElroy with a 4/3 score on Thursdays, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team traveled from behind four points alone, considering that the Ferrica team, as the masters, had to play with destruction to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says that “categorically” will not disarm unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions had exacerbated mistrust with the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Young Ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear site and the commitment not to increase nuclear weapons stocks or to develop nuclear technologies.
“We do not see a symmetrical reaction from the United States, however,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to unilaterally take action on disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the already sounded North Korean complaints about Washington's “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phoenian had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Ying and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start moving towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea was seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States stated that Phoenician must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls for the weakening of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that “denuclearization must be done first” and increases the level of pressure through sanctions in order to enforce their goal and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war,” says Ri.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that ongoing sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea had been a party to the issue of denuclearization and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech differed dramatically from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim a suicide rocket.
This year, at UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set any time limits for the process: “Does it take two years, three years or five months — not matter”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Phoenician for the steps that have been taken.
However, the Secretary-General of the United States of America, Mike Pompeo, addressed the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and legally until we see full, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop the financing of the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ree at the UN Geneva Summit and announced after the meeting that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Phoenician, saying that progress had been made, but within hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit requirements”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex and the nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month, if the United States took appropriate measures.
According to Kim, he told him that the “measures in question” he referred to were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special classes
This year's new course at Harvard University has helped all primary students to learn more about sleeping and to fight the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to wake up “nights in the spring”.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first in his lineage in the United States.
Once it was opened, it was lit up with the idea of introducing such a course by giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘I’m very sorry that I only found out now that I’m almost done with my studies.’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first proposed to students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sporting success, as well as how it improves the overall self-esteem of a person.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been found that students were seriously sleep-deprived during the school week.
The class lasts for one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one section of the class, a picture of a dormitory where students pressing coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books is provided with information on how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, and sleep deprivation — affect sports outcomes, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes do not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chaseler.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “feel all night, ” is still common enough, and modern technologies, just as increasing pressure on students, mean that deprivation of sleep becomes a problem.
He said that sufficient sleep of good quality was a student's “secret weapon” to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, as lack of sleep made his brain hungry, making him constantly feel hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop a course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information all over the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar training programme before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students set up an alarm clock to warn them that they need to sleep and wake up, and that they remember the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which violates a person's biorhythmism and leads to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga wins Gerard's team
Rangers survived another sad retreat because Dolly Menga's goal led Steven Gerard's unscrupulous team to defeat with a 1-0 bill in Livingston.
The Aybrox team hoped to win its first victory on the way out after winning the 4-1 account in February in St. John's, but Gary Holt's team took only the second defeat of Gerard out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving the Harts team the Scottish Premier League a light victory.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, who had lost spirit, did not seem to be going to settle the score.
While Rangers now ranked sixth, Livingstone took third place, and only Hibernian gave way to the head-killing ratio.
And Rangers may have additional problems after the linear judge, Kalum Spence, had to heal the head wound after an object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements on a team that went through Air in the semifinal for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livi 11 strategy, which increased the Harts gap last week, and he would be happy to see his well-formed composition tighten up his opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have led with a sword, but Livingstone pulled more when the ball hit them.
They had to score in just two minutes when the first transmission to Menga Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the half-defendant took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs carried out a fine strike against Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgo, was only able to send the ball to the far side of the gang.
Rangers took control, but in the last third, there seems to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to strike a penalty strike for forty-fifth minutes when he and Stephen Loules met, but Judge Stephen Thompson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
Rangers made only two strikes in the first time, but former Gatekeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassane Kulibali's blow to the head and the low blow to Ovi Ejaria.
Although Livi's first goal, which was killed for the 34th minute, may not have been a match for the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own labor.
But again, Rangers couldn't handle the Jacobs game from the standard point of view.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to hand the ball over to Menga to finish.
Gerard took action on the break when he changed Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and that replacement almost immediately resulted when the ultimate half-defendant gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to involve guests in their intended game with Lithgo and Halkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the breakout at the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Lithgo gave up the field.
Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty strike after he met Jacobs, but Tomson refused again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our almanac "Resurrection Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, a future physicist named Johannes Wilhelm "Gajger" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As a foundation of science, Geiger's counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s Coloque Coronado, with the cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — unlike scientists — in the main roles of:
Man: "What kind of thing is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earrings, you can really hear the impact of atoms generated by radiation in minerals.”
Evans: "Here, now I can hear you!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not only a few days before he was 63 years old.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anomalously growing cells and kill them
Part of the vaccine’s treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then the cells must be re-manufactured.
The sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One of the patients who received this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then re-introducing the patient's modified cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Wifezda, Maryland states: “The results we received suggest that we have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, light and colorectal cancer.
A similar method has been successfully applied to the treatment of leukemia, which was to prevent immune cells from being taken from patients and their “training” as needed to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West spoke in defense of Trump in a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It's all gone bad.
Kanye West was whistled at the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke in defense of US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would retake office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "The Ghost City", which he wore, "Let's Make America Great Again", the performer gave a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," the performer said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Trial Committee on Christine Blacy Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
The crowd was not shown to be upset with West, but the video was uploaded to the social media by a comic named Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
In addition, West complained to the audience about his cap being ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They made fun of me behind the scenes.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “They also said my position is not cool.”
West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool, put on a superman's cloak, so no one can tell you what to do, do you want the world to continue?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, members of the SNL acting team seemed distracted, and one said to the publication, “The whole studio has been silenced”.
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by Westoma's song "I Love It" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest people: THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT OF MANY”.
The lead talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creation) who, in my opinion, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Paffy and P. Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dog, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, could be cited by a recent legend artist, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder on account of a scissor at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballihakamora, according to police reports.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The Star of the Thrones Keith Harrington attacks on toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow's sword - waving sword in the cruel medieval fantasy HBO Game of Thrones.
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor has criticized the macho stereotype, saying that such characters often suggest to young people that it is necessary to be cruel to be respected.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture Keith, he said that he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague in the film Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, admitted that he was “indifferent” to the problem.
“I personally take this very seriously: where did we go wrong with the sense of courage?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach grown-ups that we now have such a problem?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this surge of toxic courage due to overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: "What is born and what is acquired?
What is it that they teach on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel that they have only one specific side of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because there's something wrong with young people today, really.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not participate in any of the games of the thrones after the show ended next summer, saying that he had “done away with the battalions and the horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a major role in Sam Shepard's reshooting “True West” about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best finale of the Thrones Games for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life,” says the actor.
Rose was the subject of Keith Jon Snow’s character’s passion in a fantasy series that was awarded to Emma.
The couple noted the wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens who have HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were recorded.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, it was by this means that the number of HIV infections was virtually zero, said Chinese health representatives at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT Community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information about the leak of information on the guilt of the Republican Party senators, complaining of “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, on Saturday, rejected allegations that one of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The L.A. Democrat claims that claims were falsified by ultra-right experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and even more vile lies, ” Waters says on his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators: Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during hearings with the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Charges against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office and reported on Waters staff, Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures us.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by these frauds, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is a complete lie.”
Waters immediately criticized the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial, ” writes Fleischer.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you haven't done, why be angry?
And you don't have to make excuses either.
And you can't dig into the motives of the prosecutors either.
We need to stay calm and cool.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Cavanaugh, whose critics accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's very important," he writes.
Waters stated in his statement that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will ensure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again — the weak parody of a spy named Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain appears in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise Agent Johnny English, which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: Reloading.
Will a self-ironic image with the "obviously we're all shit" label become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, Johnnie English’s full - time professor Johnny Inglish and his rubber face had his right to chaos for the second time — his name is the brightest indication that he is a wide - screen comical creation designed for the Neglecian cinematographic audience.
The hero, of course, received a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bin's features and a portion of this guy who made one single note to the 2013 Chariots of Fire in London at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Initially, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played the now forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
In this last edition of the JE, there is one or two pleasant moments.
I loved the scene when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the shovels were climbing on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to the physical performance of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely redundant, especially because such “serious” motion pictures as Agent 007 and Mission Inconclusive now offer comedy as an element.
It's such a feeling that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, the strange crimes of Johnny English are not as inventive and appropriate as those of Atkinson in Mr. Bine movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the top-secret British network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the undercover agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, was given an episodeal role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the Quasi-Therese-May character, but there is nothing to work with in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy was compromised, she would have to resign.
And this is where Johnny English, who is now a school teacher at a Pont Institute, is acting as his own unscrupulous character, but also provides informal lessons in secret operational work: there are a few good jokes here, because English offers the skills of a “year” spy academy.
English is returning to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former unfortunate friend, Buff, who is played by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is in charge of the submarine commander, the role of “happy hockey clubs”, in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because Her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they're facing a beautiful year-old woman named Ofelia Bulletov in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously ensnared by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the vicious Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff start with an odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves into the luxury of Volt's yacht; and English gives birth to a complete anarchy by trying to use the features of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All of these scenes are, of course, a nice and squeamish invention, but there's something completely childish about it.
It's a very moderate thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking, can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that is commensurate with his talent?
Labour deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day salary.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin is going to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but will receive payment in five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to give savings to employees resulting from the artificial intelligence revolution by providing them with an additional weekend.
This would allow staff to enjoy three-day holidays for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea “belongs” to the economic agenda of the party and would help the people of the country to take sides with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved a four-day shift to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
A high-level Labour Party source said The Sunday Times: It is expected that policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance in the economy in favour of workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this desire is not currently approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour Conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power from the “faceless directors” and “specculators” of municipal firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their share back, as the Labour Government can make “counts” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and the establishment of Inclusive Ownership Funds funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms to workers who could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes," whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Judge for at least a week and asked whether the Agency's findings could prompt any of the Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, could the FBI find anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Oh, of course," Kennedy replied.
"When I went to the meeting, I said I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, I came up with this information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was firm, determined and unambiguous.”
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained inviolable.
“I firmly defined Brett Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are comparable to dynamite,” he said.
“Doctor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but there’s one thing I know for sure: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, turning to Christine Blacy Ford.
“Neither of those who she was calling as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I saw nothing new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event involving an impressive star team with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, as part of the World Citizens' Festival, tens of thousands of people have flocked to a large stretch of Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendez, as well as to talk about the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens' Festival is a continuation of a global project to combat poverty by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not prepared to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteering or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other significant actions to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12 - year World Citizens’ Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is it the idea of paying people a free visit to a concert to really convince fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “critivism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing online petitions or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organisers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded at the festival, held by supporters of the festival, with many different objectives.
It is recalled that, thanks to these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group issued 390 pledges and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to “helping children to fully discover their potential” pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make a social injustice over the lack of nutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through nutrition-enhancing activities.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen organizers reply: “This will be a long and difficult road on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy B, Jeanelle Moné are some of the artists who will be performing at this year's New York event and will be led by Deborah Lee Fernance and Hugh Jackman.
US$ could be used by the naval fleet to block Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
US Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that Washington could “use” its naval fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinké claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the sea routes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” says the Minister.
Zinké approached participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as “the voice of the consumer of energy” in the United States.
It further compares Washington ' s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient in the use and replacement of fuel,” says the minister, calling Russia “a pony with one trick, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made because the Trump administration had set the task of increasing its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States himself, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” project of the Northern Stream-2 pipeline, which Berlin said made a prisoner of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream-2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington ' s fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, in the face of the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem”, said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will study carefully the election opportunities for the presidency in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that she would carefully explore the possibility of running for president after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the pre-election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “repair” our broken government, and to do so “on top” requires a woman, ” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will consider carefully the possibility of presidential election.”
Warren thus assessed President Donald Trump's activities during the meeting, “leading the district in the wrong direction”.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote on her Twitter: “At last, we need to investigate the FBI before we begin the vote.”
However, Thursday's survey showed that most voters in Warren himself did not think that it was due to run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Saffolka/Boston Globe Political Research Centre, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible election and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other known names of Democrats discussed in connection with the outlook for 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims that he will take an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told of Trak Paylin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump
Trak Paylin, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, returned home, is now suffering the same as other families suffering from PTSD and injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest “a blemish on the eye” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They are returning to others, crippled, asking whether the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military they have shown to their country.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman by interfering with the situation of alcohol abuse and possession of weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a member of the Vasila Police Department.
18 States, D.C., have supported the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support the legal challenge of the new US policy, which prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county submitted an analysis note Friday in Washington of the court's adviser on the support of the asylum-seekers who disputed the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons in the criminal group” subjected her to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have made numerous applications for asylum in the United States as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum had repealed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which had allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General Karl Rasin of the District of Colombia stated in his statement Friday that the new policy would “ignor decades of application of State, Federal and International Law”.
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the action and that such a prohibition violates that principle,” says a judicial adviser.
Lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants are detrimental to the US economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sachs ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims of domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion”, Sachns said in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palo: the number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
The situation has become increasingly difficult for the survivors.
“Now it’s very difficult, ” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma’s mother, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Emergency assistance brings in injured people every minute.
Clean water in large deficits.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who had a vertebral and shoulder fracture, rested near Palu’s army hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the room because of persistent strong blows.
He cries, remembering how a severe earthquake destroyed the hotel room on the fifth floor he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife scream, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're saved and now they're all right.”
The US Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a daily American publication describing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred last Wednesday to the fee addition of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper publication in Iowa State, accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections to be held on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have informed Reuters: a new phase is under way in Washington's growing pressure campaign against China.
While it is the norm for foreign Governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of the trade war, resulting in a level playing field between tariffs on imports of their countries.
China ' s responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at striking exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic Party of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this weed by posting propaganda in our own free press”.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government enjoys our dear heart the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying for and posting advertising in Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“However, in the newspaper kiosks here on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear different voices and see the true diversity of views that Chinese might have learned about China’s worrying economic policy, since local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers “has been rebaptized” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not specify the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: the Kavanaugh delivery of Republicans push electoral women away before the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay away and defend the candidature of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this situation have deteriorated to an extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
Such things cannot be returned later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s attempts to investigate the FBI at the very last minute will suffice to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it either tomorrow or November”, Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the MovementOn Progressive Group, Washington, D.C. said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted “November Forward!” across the street from the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Cavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” said unparty politician Stu Rotenberg on the news site.
"People say that the situation has already grown sufficiently high, and that is true.
But everything can get worse, especially in terms of women voters in suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Judge candidate, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could trigger a reaction.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh sat down on the bench of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with it as they do,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps elect Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have divided a few on the question of whom to believe — Ford or Cavanaugh, and a little more on the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe exactly or most likely Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they believe exactly or most likely Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
Fleika F.B.I. is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford was sworn to testify on the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, who was intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Judge showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Web, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Open Platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how to give people access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that the goal of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or PO.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data storage facility is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company refers to this principle as “personal empowerment through data”.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of state-owned developers with whom a project contract has been concluded, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google whether his companies were worth making major changes, making all their business models completely change overnight.
“We do not ask them permission.”
In his post on the Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the voice of Berners-Li has been quite influential in the debates on net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: church servant awarded Victoria's Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellengliz and Leukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed four days later by a sniper, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
A monument to this event was solemnly presented to him by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the St. Canten Canal “in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field weapons and machine guns”.
Later, he threw himself onto the line of fire and with the “greatest courage” led the group forward, and then with one hand, he threw a field rifle at the three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
A 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said that “he would hardly be able to do the same heroic thing, but that is reassuring.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set up a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the virtue of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people.”
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they showed them Peppo's pig.
Imagine you haven't slept all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you haven't been allowed to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 battles, including six battles of the main programme, and the fights were broadcast all night on live television on the 5 channel of British television.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British patients were stunned to see Pig Peppa on the screens.
Some patients were not impressed, for they did not sleep until morning just to see the fighting.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change in the broadcast on a children's cartoon “a sick joke”.
“There was a public decree that this content was inappropriate for six hours in the morning, so they had to switch to child programs,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President of the Marketing and Communication Bellator, when he was asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pig Peppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they were planning to make a timetable so that future battles could also be seen by British viewers.
“As for the re-examination, I think we can resolve this issue,” says Koker.
"But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't solve this issue until Sunday of our time, and it'll be Monday for them.
But we will do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and they were all far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical malfunction.
Turns out it wasn't, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and we're going to try to increase the number for the fans, but we're going to win.
Yeah, it didn't work out so well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inadequate because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that “not everyone like him” until he went to high school.
In his first radio programme, Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope. ”
He also said that winning the Olympics had become less disturbing to him after he had a child.
Kirsty Young's ongoing longtime show because of his illness took a few months off.
Daley, who served as Laverne's main guest, said that he felt “more worthless than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls”.
He says: “To this day these feelings of worthlessness and inappropriateness were real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learned about his sexual orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a famous LGBT activist and at his address at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky enough to be able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world's three-time champion said that his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, had been “stressed”.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar laureate, who is 20 years older than he is, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If there is so much going on in your life at such a young age”, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer who would have the same fundamentally opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Blackdale, and Daley said that "his whole world was changed."
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I have to win the gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know what, there are things and more respectable gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept that he was dying, and one of his last requests was first-line tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, then you won’t be around anymore, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’ says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” said the athlete.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that what I had dreamed of all my life was to dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — the Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and that is how he still likes it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikelson, not in shape, spent this Saturday, Ryder's Cup on a bench.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Cup of Ryder, but he's gonna have to pull up his uniform to avoid a nasty milestone.
Michelson, who played the Biennale on record on the 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furik to a four-ball stand on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as has often been the case in the United States, the five-time big winner has divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of correcting what concerns him.
Never having the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf National rigid route, where a long shelf usually punishes for inaccurate blows.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mikelson will meet the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion in the ninth match on Sunday, who joined the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 single games make a good start, the Mikkelson match can be decisive.
Feric expressed confidence in his partner, although what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, touched me on the back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferrick commented.
"He's pretty confident about himself.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's what it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all of them."
On Sunday, Michaelson will beat Nick Foldo's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which was never in line with the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven nobodys, although Ferrick said his presence was of great benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to start people, and he’s a great guy with whom he’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think that this week the young players had fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows in his experience that large single-level leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a disadvantage.
The Danish debuted in a game in Valderram in 1997, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line just a little bit ahead of the lowest difference, winning the 141⁄2-131⁄2 account.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only for now”, said Bjorn, who was sealed in the photo, after viewing the 2018 Class, winning the 5-3 game with both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an account of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be on full alert.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as there are no points on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said without saying a word, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that what we stand against is against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players made the golf course uncomfortable for them, Bjorn added: “I would never exceed myself in this.
We have another test tomorrow.
Individual statements begin tomorrow, and this is quite another matter.
It's always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone there, you're trying out all your professional golfing skills.
That is the idea that players need to be inspired to put themselves in full tomorrow.
The partner now remains behind, and he must make every effort as well.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will perform better individually than their partners, except Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferrick himself has been through all this carousel for the past few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finally loses when Europe held the Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in reply to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, put his players together before the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it faster, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it exerts great pressure on the middle.
We set up our game plan accordingly and set the boys right, you know, tomorrow we'll try to create a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory Makilre in the middle of the summit with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this group of guys, and in this way because I think they will overcome all possible shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The deployment of a new German warship has been postponed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the cold war era, but this will not happen at least next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the avalanche of value, local media reported.
The entry into operation of Reinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the entirely new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, referring to the military representative.
The vessel was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since the delivery had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the 2007 naval fleet will replace the elderly frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will have a powerful rifle, many air- and anti-ship rockets, as well as some steals technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying the newest frigates for up to two years away from the domestic ports.
Nevertheless, the constant delay in entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter the arms, Die Zeit notes.
The vicious F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German naval fleet officially abandoned the entry into service of the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made the warship useless when used in combat.
Software shortages were particularly critical, since the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the labour force in the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy to reduce its productivity and limit the ability of the IMF to implement updates in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rainland-Pfalz ship is twice as heavy as those used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The anchor problems of the newest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the naval forces were in fact “the end of the stock of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said that the problem had worsened over time because the old ships had been removed from service, but they had not been replaced.
He visited that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had ever been able to take over the fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in one of the Scottish mountains has the task of showing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is to be hoped that the data received will allow a fresh look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help to maintain species.
A study organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will examine ordinary bats, bats soprano, as well as brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nocturnals inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at some points around the site to monitor the operations of bats throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the activities for which the various groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the living environment will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Duar, the NTS conservation adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of work for the management of the habitat, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forest masses, optimal for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of disappearing because of construction and development that affect their residence and the loss of an environment.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a risk, such as glued fly bands, chemical treatment of construction materials and hunting of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to determine exactly the obstacles to flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious in relation to bat populations.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, which conduct regular interviews, checkouts and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only one in Scotland for flying mice in the Three in Damfris and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that property is the perfect territory for them.
“Here, in Three, it’s a great place for bats to fly,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good living environment.
But much about flying mice remains unknown, so the work that we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a healthy existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking the presence of bats before the maintenance of private property, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could result in the death of up to 400 females and young persons, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Mouse flying is protected by law, destruction, grassland or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, Scottish officer of the Air Force Conservation Fund, is calling the public for help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of them live.”
Ronaldo denies the rape charge, and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Christian Ronald is denied the allegations of rape against him, calling them “fake news” and claiming that people simply “want to spill their names” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which has issued accusations against the football player.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was charged with the rape of an American woman named Catherine Majorga, who allegedly took place in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in Instagram, where 142 million subscribers have a football player, hours after the indictment was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fairy tale news, says five-time Ballon d'Or winner per camera.
"They just want to get drunk using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's only part of their work.
“ I’m a happy person, and I’m doing great, ” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldu's lawyers are preparing to sue Spigel for charges they have called “unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage in a manner consistent with the seriousness of a legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal form, according to documents filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent a good guy, but he was 1 per cent flat.”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she approached the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fear that she would get revenge” and feared “public humiliation”.
34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he switched to Italian Juve giants in a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom “complains of Autoproducers Lost Forever”
Minister of Business and Enterprise Greg Clark said that Britain would “sorry forever” if it lost its status as world leader in the field of car production after Brexit.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK had reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a transaction, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese auto-producer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a transaction under Brexit could result in job losses.
The plant in Bernaston is manufactured by Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it released nearly 150,000 vehicles, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota, Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to the auto-producers, the supply chain will be at great risk in the absence of a transaction under Brexit.
The Toyota production line is launched “exactly on time” and the details for the vehicles manufactured on order are supplied by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK withdraws from the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be disruptions at the border, which industry said could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store its stock at its Derbisher plant for more than one day, and production will therefore be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan, which was broadcast in Chekers, on future relations with the EU was “exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need a deal. We want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not specify how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory union, says that the concerns of the members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “transferred to another week”, as Brett Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of Supreme Judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference with the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Attorney-General from office, thereby jeopardizing Muller's independence, there had been a lot of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeachment by the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he “would prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid confrontation with the Senate Judicial Committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation into the FBI complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, addressed Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, or perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not given briefings in the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace, the lead, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not caused by “the neglect of the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing the audience.”
It proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President meets more in response to journalists’ questions than any other president before him,” she added, without specifying, however, the exact figures: “We have these figures.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We are doing this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held over the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it is a worthy replacement for the press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking persons.
Conferences are only rare for the press.
The frivolous and sometimes strange behaviour of the President in front of the assembled journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter of concern about Brexit
The Minister of Health has asked EU staff working in the Scottish GHS to express their gratitude on behalf of the whole country and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, an SME, addressed this letter to staff less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of issuing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit continued, and the expected decision should be made in that autumn.
However, the British Government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, right now, I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues with and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency head injury operation.
Michael Organ from Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers' half-defendant Christian Abercrombie had undergone an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 strike with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The head coach of Tennessee Road Reed told reporters that the trauma was sustained shortly before the break.
“He came out to the sideline and just collapsed there, ” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the stretcher and taking it for medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had performed an operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/degree of injury yet,” and Tennessee is trying to find out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercrombie, who was only in second grade, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully seized five balls, amounting to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher herb fee when buying real estate in Britain.
Under Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb fee in the purchase of real estate in Britain, and the additional funds received will be used to help the homeless.
This step will nullify Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
An increased herb fee will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million per year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb fee in the purchase of real estate in Britain, and the additional funds will be used to help the homeless, as announced today by Teresa May.
This step will nullify Corbin ' s efforts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more accessible and raise the income of citizens.
The increase in the Herb Assembly would be imposed on individuals and firms not paying taxes in Britain, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to help homeless citizens.
An allowance for the existing herb fee, including an increase imposed two years ago on the acquisition of secondary housing and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will provide up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's new real estate is purchased by non-British residents, leading to price increases and making it more difficult for buyers who purchase their first dwellings to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who have spent most of their time outside the country buying housing here.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the herb assembly to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of embezzling real estate prices by acquiring land but not actually using them, and urged Ms. May to give up affordable housing quotas to remedy the “disgusting housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include monitoring rent and ending unjustified evictions.
He also wished to give local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream of making life better for every new generation.
This, including the solution to problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not British nationals and foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible as for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too distant, and the threat to some is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
Sunderland club chief Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
A 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the rebirth of the North-East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league, which separates three points from the championship.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's it," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching my father and his father go to Scotland in Hampden, and it always attracted me back.
However, it will only be possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dicka Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardeis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poiet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says that he did not feel nervous about such authoritative names in such large clubs, having previously given up the Barnesley and Ipswich Town proposals.
“For me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
The club certainly belongs to the Prime Minister’s League, according to its structure and capabilities,” says the coach.
“To get him out there is a difficult task, but I will believe that I have done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts Training Headquarters.
Then he helped Alloa rise from the third level and next season he took St Mirren from the lower positions to the winners of the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real cross,” he recalls his responsible work in Alloa.
“I honestly believed that management was better than a game.
That sounds strange because I have done well, made good money in this position and have achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are many things to be done every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good about being the manager.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”

According to the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer
The summer heat has increased the sales of British pubs, but it has reduced sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistics, says: “The continued solar activity, as well as longer than expected, the participation of England in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, in June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8% and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.”
The fall in income in restaurant trade in June by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
pubs and liquor bars have shown much higher results than in restaurants.
People who sell only food have also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There's a feeling that people want to jump out of the street just to miss a glass.
Drink sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in leisure and hotel business, says: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting activities remain essential factors when it comes to non-existent market sales.
No wonder restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since the decline in sales by 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to the continuing price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved to be more than ever for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, will provide much-needed rest.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.

Every fifth child has secret accounts on social media that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some only 11 years old — have secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of fairytales
This news has raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a "core" account that their parents know about.
However, every fifth child, some of whom are just 11 years old, creates accounts in social media that he hides from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fairy accounts in Insti, i.e. Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news has raised concerns about publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a primary, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, ran into a teenager there who urged others to “rape him”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC revealed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles in social networks, half of whom admitted that one was usually secretive.
HMC chapter Mike Buchanan says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and this is a worrying fact.”
Ailid Doyle will be the voice of Scottish athletics athletes
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eylid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most renowned athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beatty claims that this step is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the extensive international experience of athletes over the past decade.
“Ailid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities, and we are confident that his participation will be of great benefit in Scotland’s easy athletics,” says Beatty.
Doyle says, “I strive to become the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland.”
An American who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and is now working as a serial commentator on the BBC, losing his ability to walk after a stroke.
He writes in his Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing for the trick!
Thank you so much for your support!"
A milky advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows shared the views of Internet users
The dairy company sparked disputes on the Internet by publishing an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows.
As they say, “the world’s first silent breast milk,” the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milkhead gives to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in full hay under a musical track that says, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and, "If you haven't noticed, it's not washing, it's my breast."
And the chorus is, "We travel, we travel, we feed our babies with breast milk, we squeeze, we squeeze."
This commercial, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed reaction from viewers, many saying that it sheds light on the horrors of the milk industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and given birth in order to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within a few days of birth, ” writes one user.
Elvie Molocootsos is directly dressed under a special busthalter (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It is clear that this is just as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk for mothers who leave their children?"
Another user adds: “Advertisement removed from reality”.
On the contrary, others were protecting the roll, and one woman even wrote that the song was “excellent. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed the baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breast - feeding really made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but it's kind of like that.
A genius product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "Fun advertising based on moms who breast-feed (often they do it directly in their workplaces or in the toilets) and who really feel a little "cows."
This advertisement is not to praise or mock our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these stealthy milkballs hidden under the bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milk is totally insensible, has no wires or pipes, is freely placed in a breast-feeding bra, and is not visible, allowing women to move, hold young children and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and specialist in early childhood development of Mother, comments: “The Elvie Molocootsos is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
In a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, demonstrating in a joking and entertaining way the incredible sense of freedom that gives new milk.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Martha Yakobowski using this product by appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children have immigrated to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with the trustees.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by sponsoring the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified in Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested the custody of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had not previously been tried.
“Approximately 80 per cent of those who are either in charge or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these persons," said Olbens.
In an effort to speed up the process of shaping children, officials have introduced new rules according to which some of them should be brought before the court within a month of detention, not 60 days later.
To declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video rather than in person.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter and information workers in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are being exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the child is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that taking children to tent camps without allowing them time emotionally to prepare or say good-bye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the U.S., France and Turkey immediately to withdraw troops
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war has been taking place in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of countering terrorism, and would be “considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions”, he said to the assembled.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return and accused “some Western countries” of spreading irrational fears, which had led refugees to stay outside the country.
“We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They will politicize what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the reconstruction until a political agreement to end the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major plot of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines”, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including those from the Al-Qaida-related Nusra front, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened shortly to elaborate a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “considering the articles of the current Constitution” and cautioning against interference.
Why will Trump win the second term?
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and the scandal fail to complete his presidency prematurely, which is probably what many liberal viewers hope for.
And this will no doubt be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
At present, there are no signs of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have grown to more than double — to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times — to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed the cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million viewers per night on screen during the main news show.
“This is the fire to which people are drawn, because it is beyond our understanding,” says Neil Barr, director of ABC’s “Dedicated Survivor” drama, of a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol has been destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skwell, a long-published comedy writer and author of “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about breaking into the Hollywood Boys Club” suggests another theory.
She remembers riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is funny,” said Mrs. Skowell.
In all this chaos, there is something precious — fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content broadcast on television, the Washington newscasts can determine the future of Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you've been watching for the sixth hour in a row, how a group of experts is discussing using Bob Woodward's “deep background” for their book Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket from the ostrich's skin (the clothes that are beaten with pride,” says Washington Post), or the sharp description of Stormy Daniels, let's say, Mr. Trump's anatomy is already beyond ordinary awareness.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“It’s often his job to make us feel that the reality of the show is that he feeds you something every night, ” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars about the changing performance of Trump and the daily turns of the story (drag with N.F.L., praise to Kim Chen Yn).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleise this week, the north coast of Cauai was 27 degrees warm, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his home and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get away from the screen, at least not when it was shown how Brett Cavanaugh was represented before the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was being decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” said Mr. Flace.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money flows into the fiercest intermediate elections run by the White House
No wonder the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives cash flows from the change of districts in Congress, in which two officials participate in the same race.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed recently, is supported by a Democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Conor Lamba, who took office in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb opposes another active official, a republican of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intertwined with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that, as a result of the electoral arrangements, the old areas had been attributed to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated discussion on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lemba became known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the March special election in Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
United States dollars were punished by El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had caused Washington ' s negative reaction.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama. He was also in Panama until the partners emigrated the management team of Trump.
The representatives of the Department of State decided to withdraw American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, the press secretary of the Department of Hezer Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received some $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed fines, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that country in Central America with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held in order to produce the outcome of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high-level representatives of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, and had actually stopped considering the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be delivered by Vice-President Mike Pens in symbol that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
The three American diplomatic representatives had safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that were discussed by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports are also confirmed by a foreign analyst in the administration but also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice, which is currently very much evidence in public reports.
Mr. Mueller was also reportedly investigating the existence of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia and its attacks during the previous elections.
If Congress replaces the owner, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in that body, just as he is preparing to speak to the voters again, and possibly eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many “ifs”; I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalent in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakian troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and thus have missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around such points, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed to make secret recordings of the President's activities last year and to discuss his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times data are incorrect.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is nevertheless approved as the Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in favour of the Congress, which will bring Mr. Trump to justice in the medium term?
If we fail to pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can go through them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied an embassy house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she accompanied me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such a family past as I may not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, is president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and author of the book The Last Palace: The Worried Age of Europe in the History of Five Lives and a Legendary House
Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic in the face of a clash with the Vienna-based Rapid Football Club.
Rangers adopt the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive no-one in Spain over Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe group.
The knee trauma prevented half-defendant Graham Dorrans from speaking in the season for the first time to anyone with a score of 2:2 against Villarreles, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a trampoline to achieve greater results.
"It was a good time for us because Villarreal is a good team," said a 31-year-old football player.
"We got into the game, thinking we could get something, and we left with nobody.
Perhaps in the end, we could have managed, but in general, no one was likely to have a fair outcome.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came in the second time where we proved to be better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a complicated game because they've shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of the sick, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, given all the injuries I've suffered and the replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully improved, and the guys are really enjoying it; the training has been “hours”.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success.”
Women lose their sleep due to fear of their pension savings
Although the participants had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few had spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their wives.
However, only 10% said that they had spoken to their children on the subject.
“People want to be cared for by someone in the family, but they don’t try to discuss the subject with them, ” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance.
That's exactly what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for what they may need to take care of you if you do not hear your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will receive medical care, since this choice can be an important cost factor.
Ask your financial consultant: He will help you develop a plan to pay for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or self-insured by your own property, provided you have the money.
Get your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battalions.
Make sure that your health care is entrusted and appoint a trusted person to monitor your health care and to ensure that your wishes are met if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of developing financial confidence.
A trusted person should be selected to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are incapacitated.
Remember, too, that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to provide information on what medication he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write all these details on the paper so that you can prepare yourself just in case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have finances but also to have doctors.”
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Draw up and record this plan.”

The victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ifracombe, Devon, in the chest, abdomen, and arm of a 40 - year - old bullet.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. in English summer time as a “accident”.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
Wounds are not life-threatening, police are currently searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase.
As a result of the failure of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Palo, near the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pal and Donggal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow cove on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and a tsunami struck.
Donggala is a district along 300 km (180 km) of the coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative area of the province, was 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has been destroyed several times in Palu and Donggal for the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
Tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic ring of fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia ' s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The frequency of severe earthquakes collapsed on the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the most densely populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 magnitude earthquake took place in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-point earthquake took place on one of the islands of Mentaway in Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit Pidi-Jai district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time no tsunami has occurred, but more than 100 people have died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son is under arrest for domestic violence.
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-chapter to President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old Palin from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with the situation of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to a police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to KTOU, Palin is in the Mat-Su Detention Facility and will be released on bail for $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “declared innocence”.
Peilin is threatened with three minor class A crimes, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting an alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, falsification of family violence and possession of alcohol-intoxicating weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed as a result of an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 - point earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social networks have video recordings of the incident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami hit the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to sentence a terrorist in New York with a rare death sentence.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City, which resulted in the death of eight people, a rare federal offence that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly rented a truck at Home Depot to attack a bicycle road on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipei “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to achieve the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out Saipov's conviction with 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “intensely planned and intentional”, Saipov carried it out, it is described as “disgusting, cruel and criminal”.
“Sifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laur Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagukko,” says the intentional notice.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecution ordered the death penalty in the Southern District of New York for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The most recent federal execution in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov ' s judicial documents, a citizen of Uzbekistan showed no remorse after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was glad he did.
According to the prosecutor, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by a video of ISIS on the phone to carry out the attack.
He also asked for a flag of ISIS in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denies his guilt over all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, a federal public defender on the side of Saipova, said that they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
The protection of Saipova had previously requested prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentary member Tori says that Nigel Faraj should not be held responsible for the talks on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
Former leader Ukip said that politicians should “feel like” Eurosceptics, as one member of Parliament, Teresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the conservative party, Peter Bone, said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have "come out" if Mr. Faraz were Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deep-separated ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori Party opposed to leaving the EU join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to maintain his compromise plan, which has been heard in Chekers in the midst of attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction and thus force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally, in Solihalla, that he wanted to “encourage the Chekers”.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz be leveled and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have left already," he said.
Deputy Wellingboro added: “I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we have to play Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that the public opinion changed after the vote of 2016: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is totally out of the question.”
A supporter of Brexit from the Tori Andrea Jenkins party was also at the rally, commenting to journalists: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Checkers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote in favour of this plan, and is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and primarily electing us.
Please put the Hammers aside and start listening to what they tell you."
In her strong appeal to Ms. May, she added: “Prime ministers remain at work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies were to pass on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they must be made to feel the nacal feeling.
“This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class”, he says.
"They're trying to hand it over to Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let this go."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of being betrayed by Brexit, to feel nacal.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of that country, which has given us a victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents held a demonstration on Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved Tori v. Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized conservatives for security concerns in the mobile application of their party.
“And these people claim to be able to set up IT systems and technologies Canada plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland”, he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle," he claims.
Warren plans to “examine carefully” the opportunity to participate in the presidential race
US Parliament member Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, she will “examine the possibility of presidential balloting”.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told of her future at a council meeting in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is being re-elected in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dil, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are talks that she has a chance to take up the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holiok, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it has already been her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a council meeting.
One participant asked whether she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to “relief” our broken government, which requires a woman to be upstairs”.
As a result of the murder of Sims (detained), LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Simms, who took place on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11:00 p.m. in English time, the Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department issued a video recording of the shooting requesting help to identify the person who was able to be recorded on video.
A 20-year-old Simms was shot near the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head that killed him,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was involved in the incident, had a gun on him and shot Wade Simms.
When Simpson was arrested, he did not resist and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The young man grew up to be 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 games.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world championship after the command tactics gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Waltery Bottas was qualified on Saturday for Lewis Hamilton, it has become clear that Mercedes' command strategy will play a major role in the race.
Since Poul-Position, Bottas has been well-started and practically elevated in Hamilton when he defended his position at the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to weave in the tail of the whole group -- a choice that became decisive.
Mersedes went to the pit stop one round later, and then went behind the Fettel, but Hamilton, after some of the wheel-to-wheel struggles, burst forward, resulting in the driver of Ferrari reluctantly leaving the interior space free, risking being stuck after a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from behind a series of nets and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
Then most of the race he led, holding on to his own tires, to quickly finish, by moving Kimmy Rikkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he went to a pit stop on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight circles, since Rikekonen took fourth place.
The day seemed difficult because Waltery had done a fantastic job on the weekends and had shown true nobility by sharing it with me.
The team has done such exceptional work to have a few tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Signs of treachery
President Donald Trump criticised Senator Diane Fainstein for meeting with voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not published a letter from Christine Blacy Ford, accusing Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's statement to the Senate Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that those events were “disgusting, ugly and lying people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, is wonderful, anger, anger, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been leaking information?
Remember her answer... did you “give” the document information? — “What, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Yeah, stop.
We, did we say?...No, we didn't "slow," he added with the tone of the senator.
In July, Fainstein sent a letter detailing the charges brought by Ford v. Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally disclosed, but Fainstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t download it,” said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the allegations of flight seems to have displeased the president who commented during the Saturday rally: "Here's what I'm going to tell you: the language of the body has done a great job.
Maybe she didn't "poison," but the language of the body was the worst thing I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all available ways.
We are seeing meanness, disgustingness, they don't care who they insult, who they must overcome to gain power and control," the President's words quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for "Jiants" in the game against "Dandy"
In the Elite Hockey League, Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against Belfast Giants, winning a return match Saturday with an account of 5-3 in favour of Dundee.
The Giants won an early two-gauge advantage thanks to the strikes of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bouviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duyer took the Giants to the leaders.
François Bushar compared the Dundee account before two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen goals fixed their victory.
For the people of Adam Keefe who won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the elite league season.
It was the fourth meeting of the parties in the season when the Giants won three previous matches.
The first goal of Duyer was 3:35 after Kendall McCall's goal belt, with David Rutherford's support, and then Boviler doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the masters to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markward helped Cooney settle the score at 15:16.
Duyer confirmed that the Giants had taken the initiative on the first break when he scored the second goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts were regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the score by scoring the score at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the opportunity to take the lead at the end of the second period for the first time in a match, after which he, along with his team, secured the victory by holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five matches, are now heading to Milton Keynes for the next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board could avoid an earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously assigned to the role of hero after he deliberately went to his death so that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing as a result of a severe earthquake on Sulawesi on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Strong underground movements continue to destroy the area, and many residents of Palu have been devastated by buildings.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the fear - inspiring altitude of Mutiar Sis Al-Jufry Airport, Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he felt the height was collapsing, he jumped off her.
Later he died in the hospital.
Indonesia ' s air navigation representative, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Regrettably, the dispatcher died before he could get to Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths caused by the earthquake may reach thousands of people, as the Agency for Disaster Management reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is probably growing, as a large number of people are still under the rubble and many have never been able to get out of there,” says a representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six feet [6 m] high, devastated the city of Palu, where the mass burial of the dead would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft transport humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Rice Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “Early assistance brings victims every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will be there.
Tragedy has already taken a rather serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
President Joko Vidodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, inter alia, saying: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?’ says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person disappeared after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now reports that one person disappeared, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini states that as of Saturday afternoon, she does not have any information about a single male passenger.
The airline stated that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and the crew after they fell on the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The reasons for the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane has begun to enter the airstrip too low.
"And that's very good," Jane adds.
Jane told me that he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was on the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and shouting on board, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors repairing a dock nearby also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they carried people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Networks have shown that 111 people have been killed in airline accidents in the last two decades, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst able to prove that a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to draw up a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulett reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several cell phones; according to this data, Tellys was spending time with Chambers that night, contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to his cell phone records, he was near Chambers; when the circumstances turned out, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellys said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to phone records, they only called for one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Telly’s death, he removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," says Hale.
The defence should begin to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is an "advised hip-hop"?
Trio hip-hoppers are going to fight the negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that the content of hip hop has changed since leaving the original political and social problems.
The group wants to return to its roots and make the “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed resurgences in Britain thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sued a family couple for racist texting.
The New York nanny sued the family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny had become “another black” which the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim has been filed “for the purpose of extortion”.
Linsie Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern that the new nanny offered by the child-care service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
However, instead of texting her husband, she twice mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris.
Aware of its insidiousness, Plasco-Flexman, the “confused” fired Morris, saying in the service that the African-American nanny was doing her job badly, and in general that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, reported the New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing a family couple and demanding compensation for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, was not contracted by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said on Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism and claim that the dismissal of Morris can be considered a reasonable step, since they would no longer be able to trust her if they insulted her.
“My wife sent her what she really didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Joe Plasco, Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone with whom you were rude, even if you were rude, not wanting it yourself?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!”
Calling the claim “requirement”, Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child just two months ago and found herself in “a very difficult situation”.
"And are you prepared to persecute a person in such a situation?
Not very nice of you," added a bank worker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already passed its sentence on social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable conduct and logic problems.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the movement of a talking bear, says a new letter
Bonda’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the first reader before it is published.
It is very funny to know that Paddington is a great success.”
She also said that her father had worked as an operator for the BBC before he decided to write a children's book on the bear, and that he would regard the refusal of publications with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his books had been “and bitter” because they had not become authors in the past year.
With regard to Paddington's bear, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally become known.
“He was a quiet and modest man, ” his daughter relates.
“For Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of him, although he did not really consider this success his own merit.
I think he treated Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear himself.”
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing her daughter, she was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“Nad called regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong, ” said Mrs. Ednan Laperuza.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes, and that we should say good-bye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs her doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself firmly.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan Laperuza, in grief of losing her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, coping with the enormous loss she had just suffered.
“Nobody around knew what had happened,” she said.
“My head was gone, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have experienced loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Leeds, tells us that her son was a great cook and had a hell of a smile.
"Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was as if the light were on in the room."
However, before he died, he left his job because he really had a terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler was killed by his own brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't stop worrying about a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know that there's someone to talk to and tell, even if it's your friend.
You cannot sit and be silent, you must talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband who lived with her for 15 years — not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed, upset or anything like that,” she relates.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
On Christmas, he was particularly ill. He did not even look at the children when they opened their gifts.”
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to go through it, and this event has shaken our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Cavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring at least a little unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “breaking up” against a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The interim elections will only take place in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, everything goes badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush called the senators lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been working at the White House since then for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, had met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Penz to resolve the issue of equality of vote and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Judge.
The number of North Korean defectors decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Ying came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Bion Seug, referring to the data from the Ministry of the South, said that compared to the 2,706 incidents recorded in 2011, the figure had decreased to 1,127 cases last year.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China had been key factors, as well as higher rates imposed by smugglers exporting people.
Phinehas does not comment on public matters.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are eventually called upon to become South Koreans.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subject them to forced repatriation.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Chen in Singapore, at which they reached a common agreement on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress by sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Ree in his statement to the General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "strange," and claims he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, “expert” and said that he was unfit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman had ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately have been called a “distortion”,” says Pelosi of her reaction to the testimony of Cavanaugh on the Senate Legal Committee given to them on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that occurred when they were both still teenagers.
Cavanaugh spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even screaming and gasping about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the democratics of the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and clearly planned murder of an active person”, organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh ' s testimony merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his claims, as well as with the way he attacks Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only useful to the Supreme Court, but also to the court on which he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the District Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavanaugh with regard to the Law on Available Medical Services or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidature, Cavanaugh asked whether he would withdraw some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
“Now is not the time to put a hysterical and prejudiced person in the office of a supreme judge and to cry out, ‘How wonderful!’” says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It is righteous anger, months and years of rage; it cannot go through without tears.
“When we’re angry, we cry,” Miss Stein told me 45 later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think?”
She said, "I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in the executive position, and she said she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique to explain to her interlocutor, 'You might think I was crying because I was upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are misinterpreted in the root.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: I once wept with angry anger, but I was caught by the seams of an elderly woman, a heartless manager, whom I had always feared terribly, and dragged into a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they've finally brought you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some unserious plot and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she said to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was already coming to an end, and it was far behind in raising funds, so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“I’m a valued commodity to them, aren’t I?” she wondered.
When she gave the speech, declaring that she would not carry out an official campaign, she was so empathetic — thanks to the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and access to voters, and the anger of discrimination on the basis of sex that she was suffocating.
“You would think that I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Ms. Schroeder, about how the press responded.
“It was possible to think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
"She's always crying"?
How Trade War With America Can Be Useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first surges of trade between the United States and China have been deafening, and while the fight is still far from over, the division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made his first warning earlier this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), effectively taxing half of all US goods from China.
Beijing has had tantamount retaliatory strikes each time, setting recently taxes on US goods worth $60 billion, ranging from five to ten per cent.
China has promised that responses to the United States will be equivalent every time, and the second largest world economy is unlikely to begin to face at least the smallest challenges in the near future.
Forcing Washington to step down means surrendering, but public resignation by the United States would be too shameful for Si Jinpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic stop in any of these countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers previously recognized, ” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Centre for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria is “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem reported that conditions were improving in the country.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and safer thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism”, he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any circumstances or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Cup of Ryder 2018 by beating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has already won six consecutive games on European land and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first distant hit on the 16th hole of the pair-3, giving up his Frencho Molinari match.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming the 1st and 4th players who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a five-to-four player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbo-Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, resigned 2:1 to Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spanish man Sergio Garcia, veteran of the eight Cups of Ryder, won the tournament throughout the history of Europe with 25.5 points a career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have a cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's handing over the torch to his compatriot John Rem, who won the American Golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I am extremely proud of this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, by giving up only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly fought all weekends, trying to succeed in vain, excepted by Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were showing the highest-class golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furik of the United States said after an inconsolable statement by his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to touch Europe a little.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played excellent.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA America and our Committee on the Ryder Cup, and we will move forward for success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We have lost."
Red tide: news The concentration of microorganisms has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reflects a general decrease in the concentration of red tide in some parts of the Tampa Bay region.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, abundant flowering is reported, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red tide extends approximately 130 miles along the coastline from northern Pinell to the southern districts of Li.
The reservoirs can be seen about 10 miles from the Hillsboro district, but compared to last week, their numbers have dropped significantly.
Red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and near Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro Coastal Area, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota Districts and in coastal areas, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the Lee Coast and low concentrations in Collier County.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a possibility of respiratory irritation.
No such probability was reported in Northwest Florida last week.
