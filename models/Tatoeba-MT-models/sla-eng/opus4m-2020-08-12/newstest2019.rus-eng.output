Number of recruits ready to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed People's Republic (LNR) Andrey Morocco said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass.
According to him, Kiev is thus planning to "at least re-complete the units".
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals have led to the low staffing of the units”, said Morocco, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the actual figures for the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terror operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint force operation (UO).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the assassination of the head of the DNR Alexander Zachartchenko.
The DNR authorities have classified what happened as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that Ukrainian security services had organized the diversion.
U.S. authorities have forced Mask to leave the chair of Tesla's government
American businessman Ilon Musk will leave office as chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla's founding company at the request of the US authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the enterprise will also pay $20 million in cash.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the department allows Maska to remain in the lead position in Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $20 million and leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to his post.
It is clarified that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders of claiming sufficient funds to buy the company's shares and filed a claim against the entrepreneur.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla's shares for $420 apiece, but he never did.
After tweeting the shares, the companies grew by almost 11 per cent.
The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of seizing member countries.
Such a statement was made by the diplomat at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, opened on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is evident: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not be reduced, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the talks on Brexit had been deadlocked.
So she commented on the outcome of the European Union's informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 following the referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London has left the community.
Moreover, the question of the Irish border remained open.

The head of the Altay Selsovite stopped the hunger strike to protect the interests of the inhabitants
The deputy reported on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council stated that the situation had stalled, that the district administration was not responding to its demands, and that he needed to do his job.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office initiated a review of the situation and the FTC ' s heat supply organization promised to start work on the preparation of the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian settlement next week.
The Selsovites also drew up and brought to the Governor of the Altai region a mass collective treatment “in relation to a catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he was feeling normal, and he was fully committed to his duties as a head during the famine.
As explained by Boronin, the Siberian and Rogulic settlements have centralized heating systems, which means that they should be prepared for winter by the administration of the Pervomay region.
However, no one has yet begun this work.
The head of the Village Council also protested the lack of adequate control and support by the Government of the Altay Region and against Gazprommerzegrejongaz Novosibirsk's financial policy.
In addition to the proper training of the villages for the winter of Boronin, he demanded “to organize a full-fledged separate area of the municipality with the relevant units”.
New buildings named Moscow with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about 3,000 units of housing were purchased in Moscow's new buildings, ranging from 30 square metres and costing up to four million rubles.
More than half of these transactions took place on two CDs, showing the Urbanus portal (used by “Lenty.ru”).
The leaders of the housing sales budgeted up to four million roubles were ZC Nepresovka, located outside IKAD, in the Kotelniki district (SWAO), and the Barbaris complex in the Bibirevo area (SWAO).
Two JCs in New Moscow, South Bunino and Klené Alleys, were also prominent in the structure of the housing transactions.
Urbanus analysts note that the proportion of housing transactions to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 per cent of all sales and provides half of the total proceeds.
“The impact of apartments with less than four million roubles on the commercial success of the Central Region in the New Vatutinka and the Filat Lug ZC should be recognized,” says the study on two more New Moscow ZCs.
They generate about 35 per cent of the financial income.
Formerly, the ranking of Moscow districts with the cheapest apartments in the new buildings was presented to the real estate agency Bon Ton.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand rubles per metre) were recorded in UWAO in September 2018.
In the second and third places, the WAO and SWAO were numbered 184.1 and 192.8 thousand roubles respectively.

Telegram users complained of a malfunction in the new version
iPhone users complained about the problems of the Telegram Messenger following an update that took place on 28 September.
The user's phone number can be found out by its user ID
Complaints relate to boyfriends with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after updating, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Messenger representatives responded to the malfunction.
They said that the problem could be related to the migration of information to a new app written in Swift.
The Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app until the problems were resolved.
On 13 April, the court of Moscow upheld Roscomnadzor's claim to block the Messenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communications operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the Messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and the mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user when a court decision was reached.
Telegram has decreased by 1.2 million since the blockade in the RF

The racer, Lewis Hamilton, who won the 16th stage of Formula One Grand Prix in Russia, made a mockery of the promise not to frame Russian President Vladimir Putin with a champagne shower, as in 2015.
"This time I will not hunt you down in champagne, and this time it was someone else," he joked Hamilton during a brief conversation with the head of State, passing the TASS.
Putin laughed in reply and slapped the chaser on the shoulder.
"All is well," said the Russian leader, commenting on the situation three years ago.

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of Head of Tesla Board of Directors
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their dispute over the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Masko will have to leave the post of Head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
At the same time, the Commission allowed Muska to retain Tesla's leadership position.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be paid to Tesla.
At the same time, money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX space corporation, the neurotechnological company Neuralink and Tesla electric power plant developer, as well as the co-founder Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously filed with Tesla Ilon Mask's CEO on account of his tweeted report about the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 stock was allegedly “due to the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, Bloomberg reported earlier with reference to the Chief of Security of the Commission of Stephen Peykin.
In doing so, Ilon Musk later gave up his plans to buy the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit brought against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that the charges of fraud were unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not break it in any way," said a businessman in a CNBC interview.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective suit against Mask, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder stated that business tweets were misleading, causing Tesla stock sellers to purchase papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Mask’s careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Mask accused the head of the research company Citron Research of stock fraud.
However, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with being removed from management of the company and even from prison.
This was, in particular, claimed by CNBC’s former chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission.
The mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

The RPC compared the possible renaming of OPC to the actions of the Fascists

According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at a sharp turn”, the name of the church is the same as in Fascist Germany “to instill a yellow six-point star”.
“This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill has been created”, said a representative of the RPC on the TV channel Russia 24.

I know that there are road sports fans in Russia, strong businessmen who are willing to invest are willing to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula One team, he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we get a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team has also arisen because Sochi has this infrastructure."
The Sochi Autodrome is expecting an angel tomorrow.

Look, even the qualifications of the rostrum were practically filled, said the Vice Prime Minister.
I can say that this year's income has increased by 72 per cent compared to last year's.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the use of Soci Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will add to Sochi's attractiveness.
Dmitry Kozak didn't get past it, and the main theme of the day for Russian car-lovers is the return of Daniel Kwiat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success next season," said Vice Prime Minister of News.
It is He who gives great hopes to the pursuer.

From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK almost fell in love with each other, joking Donald Trump.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, noted a good joke about his success in the North Korean crisis.
Starting with the mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now rectified so much that they are almost in love with each other, the President of the United States noted.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as a major challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had engaged so much in relations with the DPRK that it could not even reach the leadership of the country - they simply did not turn off the phone.
At the time, the US and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing to the White House “wonderful letters”, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also cruel to Kim Chen-Yun, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has gone so far as the leaders have fallen in love with each other.
Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump has pointed out that in recent times, Phoenian has ceased nuclear and missile tests and has closed military sites.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, the President of the United States is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump kindly spoke of Kim Chen Yen from the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to reduce tension.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nietzsa called for the elimination of “Moscow language by Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children's writer and native language champion Larissa Nitza called for the expulsion from Ukraine of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language”.
To do so, she proposes a Ukrainian product, which is a “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nice shared her views on the “useability of eliminating Russian in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian publication “Observer”.
She said the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is even already eating and continues to develop further.
In time, the Ukrainians “heal” from the Moscow language, she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian was widely used on television and radio, but she was virtually absent from public space.
In the view of Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, merely “enlargement of borders for Ukrainian legislative speech”.
In the past, Nico shared the experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian regime” in a child camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons bookstore network, one of which was a Russian cashier.
And when she had not reached her end, she threw a thread at the girl's hand.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called “language schizophrenia”, urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing their names.
Recently, Nico stated that the name “Russia” had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was unable to escape the anger of the writer: when she arrived there and heard the staff talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left by slamming the door.
A man’s conversation was parted, and this brought fruit.
Protector of Urala Denis Kulakov - victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the match of the 9th tour of the Russian championship.

"I think we wanted to win more," says Kulakova's official Urala website.
“Such a difficult game has been played, a serious male conversation has been held during the break, and this has brought fruit: two balls have been scored and not missed.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you suffered at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you've lasted 90 minutes, it's fine!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day, a little bit of power to make sure nothing happens.
And so, doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, and thank you so much!
"What about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering easier, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we've got a white band, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the sick."
"Have you missed the game since he didn't go out on the field?"
"There's one thing I've missed a little, because indeed, the unpleasant situation has come up.
But I'll do it again, thanks to the physical therapist and the doctors for getting on their feet.
The most important thing is that we have won and comforted the sick.
The rest is secondary."

During the referendum on Sunday, citizens are invited to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by agreeing between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.

“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now become more muffled”, the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation “has sometimes been identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, but along with Ebola’s fever, that along with climate change or terrorism, Russia has been in this line, in any event, in a statement by a group of Western countries, which has been quite unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the Russia theme was virtually absent”.
“If I carefully examine the statement by the President of the United States, the President of France, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, people were not exactly correct”, the politician pointed out, noting that Russia “was no longer a wall that was being trained to hit with a tennis ball”.
The Head of the Sofed Branch Committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend which he believes “will be the focus of the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully apparent in a year, in two or three”.
“I do not rule out that the current session in a sense can be reversed”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “there are many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs”.
As an example, he cited situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Until, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is because he believes that there is a “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just possible, an integral participant in solving the global problems of today”.
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement won't be going backwards, it'll be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Geneva session] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was delighted to see that, if a year or two or five years ago, a Russian vision of the world was largely uninterested, the situation was different now,” said the chairman of the Sofed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “in the so-called new liberal order that characterizes the West, there are no answers to questions on how to address the world's problems due to the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious” said Kosachev, stressing in this sense that “the current session is good for the work of the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that there will be no military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, according to the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
Syria, he said, had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the removal of fighters banned in Russia by Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The Head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the Territories to the east of the Euphrates if Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the border of the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
Earlier it was reported that a 37-year-old defender had negotiated the transition to Moscow's Spartacus.
According to RT, referring to Mirror, John Terry, former captain of assembly England, led the Chelsea Youth Team.
According to the source, the well-known player, who has long served as a member of the London Club, will lead the team for up to 23 years.
It's reported that Terry will replace Jody Morris, who went to Derby County.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually he gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The first Vice-Speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Gerashenko, apologized to the person convicted in the RF for "spying" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for failing to release him from the shadows so far.
That is what she said in a video feed to a political prisoner who was recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Suschenko FSB's illegal arrest.
She said that there was an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris on these days, and participants announced a hungry protest demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them, are well-known people, starving, supporting Oleg Shadows, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, no interviews where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us did not demand pressure on the Kremlin, no pressure on Putin with one requirement - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and those who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would cripple every Ukrainian, making us “worrier, harder to protect the national interests of Ukraine, to protect every Ukrainian, to understand what is good and what is evil”.
As a reminder, the correspondent of Ucrinform in France, Roman Suschenko, was detained by Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow Airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage to the Directorate-General for Intelligence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suschenko to 12 years of strict regime, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared the verdict legal.
Russian prisoners granted the Ukrainian ' s last request prior to his transfer to the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid-sized approach to Earth from Big Ben
The American Space Agency, NASA, reported that a large SP1 asteroid is approaching the Earth, with a length of 160 metres.
According to Daily Express, a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of observation.
There is no accurate data on its size yet.
The speed at which SP1 is moving is approximately 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between the asteroid and the Earth will be on 3 October.
Then it will fly past our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA has classified it as near-earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first ever video from the surface of the Rugu asteroid.
Two Japanese bikes (planeships) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe were able to acquire unique footage.

The comments alleged that the protective coating (special plate) had affected the grass at the edge of the field.
The concert, scheduled for 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rostov Football Club and the Russian Premier League opposed the concert.
“I would like to know the names of the football players and the representatives of Rostov, who claim that my speech can harm, hinder the activities and development of the football club, and affect the performance of its players,” Basta wrote in response to criticism.
"Rostov-Arena" is one of the stadiums of the World Cup 2018.
Five matches were held at the tournament.

Wachtang Kikabide on cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease does not spare anyone, but the stories of popular people about cancer victories give hope to many who are sick.
A well - known actor, Wachtang Kikabide, admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"It's like a hammer on my skull.
I fell.
He's lost his focus.
They put it in the hospital.
There he couldn't hold the spoon, couldn't stand, fell all the time.
We've started doing tests, we've got bad cases, we've got a blood vessel.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big, filthy cyst in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst," said Kikabide in the program "Once upon a time."
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say good - bye to the maid at the door of his house.
But the actor’s wife did not allow a living actor to be protected, and she believed that she could cope with the disease and had not left her beloved husband’s bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, it was like a rock," the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he is happily living in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his sickness have been repugnant, and of his untimely death, which the matter is revealed in the Network.
Peacekeepers introduced Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Siyarto into the section "Cleaning".
The reason was “the attempt at the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the Head of the MID of the neighbouring country was identified in “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as in “in the organization of provocation aimed at a mass violation by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian legislation”.
Let us note that before Siyarto, Deputy Kyevo-Becher Lavra, and Chairman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) of Onufrey, were approved in Purgatory.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church was the reason.
Earlier, in commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zacarpathia, President Petar Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities have named the sum of the “golden parachute” of the crowese governor
Twenty-three salaries were paid on a one-time basis to the Deputy Governor of Voronezh Region, Yuri Agibalov, on the basis of the regional law on State posts.
At the same time, the actual amount of the “golden parachute” released from office by the employee was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations provided the press service of the regional Government.
According to the law, Agibalova ' s salary is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, it was emphasized in the press service that the one-time payment was less than the income tax of 223,892 rubles, not 1 million rubles written by the media.
The official has received an old-age pension since July 2018.
His internship in public office is more than nine years.
The appointment of this pension and the one-time payment shall be made as soon as he has been dismissed, explained to the RIA Novosti agency in the Government.
In doing so, Agibal's pension supplement was suspended on appointment and his salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
The winner of the governor ' s election was the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, who took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was relieved of office due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the area.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public positions in the region have been terminated.
On 29 September, the Nezigar Canal published documents that indicated that Agibalov, who had resigned from the post of Deputy Governor, had been paid an exit allowance of 23 salaries, and two days after that he again received a similar post without a “faith”.
The deputy of the State called for schoolmates to be told about the harm of masturbation
Onishenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience in his work, he noted in an interview that young people are provoked by the harmful information they find on the Internet.
It is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, MP of Gosduma RF (in an interview with Radio Speech Moscow):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, it is necessary to do so by explaining the damage, because there is a risk of sexual health of the child, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children occurs early enough, and there are large scissors between their maturation and the possibility of formal inter-sex contact.
Onishenko believes that the solution to the problem is to prevent “hunting”, to silence the “sex problem” and to prevent the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is convinced that many youths face onanism.
The MP believes that the first thing to do is to practice lessons on the harm of masturbation in schools of “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will not be caught with you, gently," said the professor.
Gennady Onishenko is an active academic at RAMN, a member of the Bureau of RAMN, a doctor of medical science, a professor.
Deserved doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Bureau of the General Russian Public Organization of the League of Health of the Nation.

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
Antiimmigrant Alternative for Germany is another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are dropping.
It appears that the German people have begun to seriously refrain from Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a well-awaited target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Recent socio-economic issues suggest that the “Alternative for Germany” anti-immigrant party is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of the ruling bloc, Merkel and Zeehofer, are weakening.
This week, ADG beat another record by raising the second line of popular sympathy.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 per cent popularity, were able to bypass the social Democrats, with about 16 per cent of them.
The gap in one percentage point could be reduced to statistical error, but it could not be overlooked that the 2013 ADG from a small group of Eurosceptic economists had become a serious political force.
Leadership in general is still holding the ruling HSS/HTS block, with about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend in the loss of points. As early as April, the support of Angela Merkel was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Let us add that “green” (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent) have been followed by social Democrats.
Evolution of Alternatives
The “Alternative for Germany” party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the “Alternative Choice 2013” group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood up to the government course, but at the outset it dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU-wide interaction.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “sponsoring” of the EU's weak economies and did not exclude the possibility of returning to Germany's mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the Eurosceptic niche and began to criticize the Government harshly for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG was able to break into the Bundestag for the first time, with 94 parliamentary seats (of 709).
Two representatives of Alternatives for Germany received seats in the European Parliament.
Video with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens “the nation of mammals” has been published
The leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, on live television, admitted that he considered his compatriots “a nation of fleas”.
They believe in TV and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“Since childhood, we have not been given a culture of reading and acceptance of texts,” said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Committee of the Independent has begun to combat literature that has the slightest intention of criticizing the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as many as 201 editions.

Canadians built a car in the event of an apocalypse, the magazine Driving
You can buy this car for anyone you want.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new bronze.
Bronewic apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
The apocalypse is not limited to video games, cinematography, and book publishing.
Now the new niche is being conquered by car companies.
Thus, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armoury of the Apocalypse Senator APC.
In fantasy-free times, the company's engineers create armoured cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, without any special comfort but in complete safety, are placed in a full-boiled bronzecapsule.
This bunker, or you won't call it a design, because the level of its reservation is in accordance with standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Bronze Salon Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order not to harm passengers, even an explosive wave from a ruptured vehicle, the car’s parlour is equipped with special shock absorbing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe inspection, the Roshel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a circular-view camera system with a night vision function, as well as an observational armoured tower on the roof.
There's no gun in the car.
Front of the Bronze Salon of the Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that the load of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Roshel Senator APC has a 330-strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litres, whose full power is passed on to four wheels of armour through a 6-stage automatic transmission box.
There's no way to get ahold of the Rosel Senator APC.
The Bronze of the Apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC will be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., which will take place in October.
Date of death of the universe
The universe has been around for about 140 billion years, ten times the age of an observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
A study by an international team of scientists has been published in the library of e-contents arXiv.org and is being published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports Japan's Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were obtained by observing, using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru, approximately ten million galaxies.
After monitoring the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the world under review, scientists assessed the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory press release noted that the observations had provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe and that the data of the European Space Telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of λCDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had submitted new arguments in favour of ending the world under review 22 billion years later as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt has failed to bring together the initiators of the pension referendum
The possibility of learning the people's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow, a general federal initiative group of referendums against the rise in retirement age took place on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that recorded various language issues (only registered five language formulations by the Centre.
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: "Are you in favour of not increasing the age laid down by the pension law as of 1 July 2018, upon which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension?"
This formulation was registered by a Vologod subgroup whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and legal body.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of a member of Righteous Russia, Ilya Sviridova (six sub-groups) and KFOR (four sub-groups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined them.
Earlier, Sviridov had said to the “Reports” that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and the agreement to come had been expressed by representatives of some 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologod subgroup (supported by 15 other subgroups), said to the “States”, that the invitations were not received and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who the friend was, but who the enemy was”.

"Admiral" has caused us great problems
Zinetula Biljeletdinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems
Zenetula Biljeletdinov, chief coach of Ak Bars, summed up the match of the regular KHL champion against Admiral (4:2).
"It was a tough game, it was complicated.

That is why there was such a decision," Biljeletdin's press service quoted the club as saying.

In Loko's match - Ahmat, Turbin's mistakes fell as if from the horns of abundance
Former All-Union Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the arbitrator Evgeny Turbin in the 9th round of Russia's "Lokomotiv" – "Ahmat" – "Ahmat" and examined the contentious episodes of the games.
- How do you evaluate the Eugenia Turbina judiciary in the Lokomotiv match?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his inadmissibility for the Russian Prime Minister's trial.
I am surprised that efforts to meet the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo, not Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI have reached serious conclusions on his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: the errors in his actions, the private failures of rough receptions, fell from the horns of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute, Edera's railroad is dropping with his hands in his penal area, defender of Ahmata Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbo doesn't put the pens on.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idova, which was in the 82nd minute when the ball appeared to be in his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play by a defense attorney in his prison area.
Turbine was close to the moment, seeing the episode and its first assistant on the right.
That moment should have been seen by the alternate judge, Sergey Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the penultimate was not appointed.
Thus, the account in the match is distorted, and sports justice has proved to be awash.
It was the same case where the judges of concepts pushed away and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- For 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who broke the rules in the fight against Krikhovjak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show me the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the judiciary, that some teams are charged with penalties for violations like the Idova episode, and some are not.
What do you think a football player says?
- I see what you mean by double standards.
There were pens.
They didn't give him away.
So the arbitrator doesn't put the second penalty in the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
He played "Locomotive" on Saturday and Ahmat has serious claims to Turbine's work because the team has been compromised.
Matt Damon played the rape suspect Judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at Senate hearings on rape charges.
The candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed narratives during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Thus, Cavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but he said that he had never been drunk before.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin during those years.
Damon also played these moments.
I was just doing a lot of drinking, and I wasn't even thinking about sex.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in the performance of Matt Damon.
Earlier, Kavanaugh was elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbara Streisand found her cloned dogs strange in behavior
American singer Barbara Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behaved quite differently than the original dork.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," said a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old coton-de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a dog of the Chihuahua species named Miracle Milly, who was called the world's smallest dog, was cloned 49 times.
Specialists are working on cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States of America considered the naval blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can begin to gain an advantage on the world energy market.
The American authorities have embarked so heavily on the fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian naval blockade, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
A U.S. head of the U.S. Navy, Ryan Zinke, spoke about the possibility of a naval blockade earlier.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civilian functions, including natural resources policies.
Therefore, Zinké ' s statement was well within the purview of the head of his department, although there was no political decoration.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinc stated that the US naval forces control the sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian deliveries to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia was still receiving a lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy in the Middle East was also the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in the region, Zinkka is confident.
The Minister made it clear that the United States was still looking forward to leading the world energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to narrow Russia and Iran down, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinkka believes.
Kalmick's director received good reviews of the festival
Our countryman, Gogol Centre actor Evgeny Sangadzhiev and his movie "Harmony" (Harmony) are awarded special mention by the jury of the sixth debut festival "Movement", held in Omsk.
The festival diploma says that “this is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players of the theatre”.
It is well known that a picture of a young Chalmian director was presented in a short film program called "Movement. Start", which featured eight films.
The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Ian is Anya on the contrary" - the director's debut of the Onus Smooth actresses.
The focus of the National Film Festival is on the young cinema, but not on the age of the creators, but on their spirit, desire and ability to take risks.
And the graduate of the Elistine School of Arts, P. Chongushov and RATI-GITISa Evgeny Sangadzhiev, meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative, and in his work he strives for new, unusual forms of expression.
More than 300 Syrians left the Idlib descaled zone per day

"I have a club in Russia that I follow.

An expensive violin was placed in a pawnshop for no price
When a man brought the LBC Boutique and Loan Lombard to the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, a violinist offered only $50 for an old and unpretentious instrument.
But an experienced store manager named Dylan McDeermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool and consulted an expert.
So it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galjano and is estimated at $250,000.
The only strings to the violin are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin was recently abducted from a city dweller and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the man who put it in the pawn shop, but there is no previous conflict with the law.
The manager says that now all the pawnbrokers will ask to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.

This meeting is particularly spicy because the clubs now have an equal number of points of 15, and they share 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, behind a far-reaching Zenita and one point from "The Beauty" that tomorrow plays with Dinamo.
The Red and Whites are now having a tough time: the club is surrounded by idiotic scandals again, and in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew into Rapidou and recently left the House of Ahmatu.

According to the translator, to understand that two countries do not need to be without each other, “sufficient to know history”.
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.

In the international market, only 20 countries so far have collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's work, which is remarkablely well ahead of the other Western protagonist, the Smolfoot cartoon, was a curious story of familiarizing a resilient jet with a representative of the human race who never believed in the existence of the main character.
Carrie Kirkpatrick and Jason Reissig's start-up project raised $23 million for their weekends, generally justifying the expectations of experts predicting 20 million to 25 million for the weekend.
With regard to the total fees for Smolfoot, they currently amount to $38.6 million (but it has already been debuted in 50 countries): the most active was Mexico, which filled out the $3.6 million film.

Next to the horror story of Corinne Hardy, another genre member, Hallfest debutante, is one of the main youth horrors of the year.
Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked in a number of major horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death" (and from a recent director), has earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh was "Crazyly Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who did not seem to fall out of the top-10 of the U.S. box office: a romantic comedy on the screens for the seventh week, and since September was the sixth-highest in the ranking of the most cassian genre in the history of 165.7 million years.
This is exactly the amount of the picture that has now been made in the internal market - the total yield of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky people who fell in the ten at the U.S. Collections from 28 to 30 September, they became the White Boy Rick and the "Bastard Mine", who earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, for the past weekend.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
Vitezya's main coach, Valery Belov, was defeated by Siberia (3:4) in the KHL regular championship match.
"The Colleague spoke of Siberian sick people, and I want to point out our sick people," says Bel's official site, "Vitages."
"I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is full of stadiums, excellent atmosphere.
After the game, perhaps the Lord helped Siberia today because they were very gravely mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro match 0:3, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, even though there were moments.
But I'm still going to take the fall.
Because they must have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's a nasty piece of shit."
The viewers are outraged by Agutin's choice for the Voice show.
The viewers of Voice 60+ accuse the mentor of Leonidas Agutin of "stupid commotion and insolence."
When he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, in his blind auditions, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the executioner.
But his son’s feelings took hold, and he chose a relative as his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but they forgave the teacher for his indiscretion in the first phase.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the star's father was completely unjustifiable in taking the place of more worthy performers.
And now viewers are not ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, as viewers of the show, we were outraged by the rude and frank instigation of our close relatives on the final staircase.
I even doubted Agutin's strength and conscience were enough to keep his father from going all the way to the top," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in the TV Man programme.
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "sent" wonderful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by what viewers still want to see in his father's show.
But, as it turns out, viewers want an objective assessment and a truly talented performer in the finals, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I feel for the Votes of Agutin, they were doomed."
"Last time Agutin showed him how he loved the Pope, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave his father in the draft who doesn't sing but whispers, how can he then call a mentor?"
"He likes the way Dad sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people are coming to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Rough Relatives show.
"On Agutina's side, it was unprofessional."
"Then we have to propose on our own show to Dad, not the show that's being done for money from the 1st Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took a place.
And I don't understand why a silent pope should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a Surgut worker with a beautiful voice and a tembrola merge and lead Papa Agutina to the final?
And then we all complain that on the stage and on the screens, the same faces for decades!
That's because you can't get through a lot of shit."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
A circle of mud and commotion.
And the money in the family budget won't be too much!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, the son of Gradsky went on blind auditions.
That's when the subway and the head didn't come to take their son on their own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, you understand."
Agutin couldn't act like a professional.

“This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio broadcasting,” Petrukovic added.
He also believed that the Moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be drawn to the Earth’s quest for a primitive organization, according to the scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of Roscosmos said that, in an optimistic way, the RF could fly to the Moon by 2030.
An offended client dropped a feces basket at 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), who is known as having a tooth on the manager of a 24-hour network store 7-Eleven: in May he put it out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And I decided to avenge my enemy in an original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went to the store and dropped on the floor and on some of the items in the regiments of the basket.
The basket contained feces and urine that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biotile.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested "the vigilante".
He was put in prison and released to court on bail at $300.
He was charged with illegal trespassing and criminal offences and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms's crime seems more ridiculous than serious, the sentence may be severe enough, as it has repeatedly violated the law: it is followed by large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of arms, reckless driving and ill-treatment of animals.

Russian pilot "Williamsa" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the Grand Prix race in Russia.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I found myself between two cars that immediately pitted me.
I lost all the positions I played on the start, in a moment, right away.
He's in a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air and get back to the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he fought his partner, he had contact with him.
I understand he's a bit mistaken.
We were in this situation on the most urgent route of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more," says Sirotkin's RIA "News."

Tarpisev called the absurd removal of Glusak and Eshchenko from the foundation of "Spartak"
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishev commented on the removal of the football players of Moscow's "Spartak" Denis Glusakow and Andrey Eshchenko from training with a basic composition after a lineup to criticise the chief coach of the team, Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is unworldly nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the team's disorder.
First of all, they're poems, they're reading and they're perceived as much as possible.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone's got an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
If Deaf and Eshchenko are making a big deal out of it, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And that doesn't serve as a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be blown up at all.
Maybe it was just time to laugh about it together.
Spartacus has many things wrong in different lines, and there is inadequacy after the introduction of young people.
Relations within the team do not seem to add optimism to this match," Tarpishev is sure.
The game of two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
Previously on "Spartack"... John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
The Syrians discussed natural technology with scientists
The Syrian Educational Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Genetics of Plants, attended a lecture by scientists at the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
The panellists made a presentation within the framework of the Global International Forum on Convergence and Natural-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was introduced by the documentary Code of Curchatov, during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, the member of the RA, Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
A lecture by a scientist is published on Sirius.
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technology needs an enormous amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
Environmental-like technologies that young scientists are working on today will help solve this problem, according to the forum organizers.
In addition, Kowalczuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a great good thing.
It's an explosive growth in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
In fact, the development of natural-like technologies is a technological replication of living-life systems.
There is a negotiable side, a targeted intervention in the life of a person.
There are always risks.
There was a car, and people were dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I am creating medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," says researcher REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the participants.
Speakers were a candidate for physical sciences, head of the Kurchatov complex of natural sciences of the NEC “Kurchatov Institute” of Kurchatov, and head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-Technologies, Viacheslav Demin.
Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi was established by the Talent and Success Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and continue to provide professional support to gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the Sumerian Online Games on Cybervision Security would provide training at Sirius.

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low appearance

Kemerovchan upset the herd of rams at the cemetery
On September 30, a well - known Kemerov Web site reported from an eyewitness that horned animals roamed one of the local cemeteries.
The animals passed through the fences and pulled out grass.
The commentators expressed differing views: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help to clear the area of weeds and herbs, but some of the city's inhabitants did not have to live:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's something for the rams to do there.
Of the rams, you will not say that they are idolaters, but it is not a matter."
In any case, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Push and push, how is that right?
There's no such thing as a word.
It's the right thing to do.
The word “depress” in the sense of “tribulation, influence, influence” exists only by phonetic means, because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word “suffer”.
We use that word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "contribute" are not only close, but even in some sense the opposite.
See for yourself.
Prolonging (church, older) means "Enough, full, enough, enough to be enough for anyone or anything to please."
Satisfying, pleasure is family words.
He used to have the meaning of "no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what, no matter what.
The Old Slavian "dolly" is related to the words "command" and "will".
Choking, squeezing, it's completely different.
These words are truly frightening "parents": daos - "wolf" (throng sheep), deyja - "die" and twoidī - "compress".
A similar phonetic form of the words “pressure” and “deplete” as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter have forced them to become contaminated.
So we have this very "d" that is also used through "a" in a letter, which is probably wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
All right, that's it.
But it is an old word, in its proper sense no longer being used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “push”.
You can also use the pressure structure, but remember, it's an office.

How good was the car?"

But the behavior of our car has been the best since the weekend."

What's the reason?"
"My attempt was good, but then it turned out to be one of the Mercedes racers."
He was getting ready to try and still managed to miss me, but I guess I lost some time on it.
After all, it hardly had a major impact on the result."
"In Sochi, it's very difficult to get ahead, and starting the race will be a key moment?"
"Perhaps so, but you never know how it's gonna go.
It's not gonna be easy anyway, 'cause our car is a little slower than Mercedes.

With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia shielded itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were destroyed by the RF Air Force.
On the third anniversary of the opening of the Russian military operation in Syria, former head of the WCC, head of the Federation Defence and Security Council Committee, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air means: Air-to-space forces had targeted and continued to strike at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airmen, the defence of jihadists has been breached, making a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government forces, transmitted by Interfax.
According to Bondarev, however, the operation of our military forces in Syria allowed Russia itself to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist factions, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and the Jabhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to Genstab of the Russian Armed Forces, about 4,000 Russian nationals and some 5,000 post-Soviet nationals fought on the IG side, TASS is transferring.
It is only those who have been identified, but not those who have not been identified, that Bondarev has emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at the far edge, otherwise this evil would "flash towards us".

Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian M.I.D. Walid Muallem accused the United States and their partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition had completely destroyed the Syrian city of Racca, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it had been targeted, and had committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and their partners provided “direct support to terrorists” because the objectives of the militants and the Western Coalition in Syria coincided with and implied “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The Head of the MlD also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria had almost been completed and the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence and that priority would be given to Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of Hostiles in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two F-15s had struck the Syrian province of Dayrez Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The United States of America has rejected all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Petr Poroshenko, believes that, in respect of the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its sovereignty.
The Head of State stated this during his visit to the Harkov region, commenting on Hungary's extradition of its passports to Zacarpathia.
In protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," said Prashenko.
According to Poroshenko, he, as president, will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are, in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the MlD in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the Consul of that country from the Coast.
“I fully share every letter that is said by the MlD”, the President noted.
On 19 September, according to the FACTS, a video was posted on the web that records the moment of extradition of Ukrainian citizens to the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo of Hungarian passports.
At the same time, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Paul Klimkin, noted that the Hungarian Consul, who appeared on the video with the release of Hungarian passports, must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also known that the Zakarpatsky District Procurator ' s Office had instituted criminal proceedings concerning the issue of Hungarian passports.

Along with Tuvalu, this republic is one of the President's favorite resting places.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the outbreak of an armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
According to Damascus, military action is now nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
That is what Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem said to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the success achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult and depriving them of their livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds to them.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison, one of the managers of the American company.
The company's losses are estimated at least at 25 billion euros.
This amount is not limited to fines and compensation.

In February, the company management stated that the commitments had already been met for 83 per cent of the vehicles, so the programme would be completed in the short term.
Volkswagen is trying to make up for the loss and restore customer confidence.
For example, the management of the concert has recently been redesigned and major restructuring and substantive changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: such a right was granted to the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with Fascist action
The head of the Synod Division of Foreign Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
“It’s like that, in Nazi Germany, to inject a yellow sharp-edged star into a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it’s for that purpose that this bill has been created”, said the Metropolitan on the TV channel Russia-24 (quote under “Interfax”).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev therefore hopes to have full control of the UPC and “put it out of the law”, the minister believes.
"It is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Previously, it was known that members of the Supreme Council were working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the Moscow Patriarchate UPC.
Deputy Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Deputy Saint-Uspanian Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) believers was published on Saturday on the home site.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives in the faith and spirit, Christians had to profess their faith and protect their shrines.
In view of the situation that has taken place, both from the information we have and from the threats to the massacres that are spreading, it is evident that we will also have to survive something," said the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The deputy laurel also stressed that it is likely that your physical presence will be needed.
The priest added: “The sons of Lenin are in a spirit, and they are in danger of slaughter, and therefore we shall protect our sanctuary.”
To whom the fate of the Pochaev laureate, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world's shrine, is not indifferent, must be prepared to protect it, says the address.
Metropolitan urged us not to go to those who led the believers astray.
OPC has the canon status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to impose on the new-style patriarch and friend of the Catholic pope of the Roman Warfolome.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we are satisfied with the status our church has," the deputy laurel said.
He recalled that the OPC had been independent and fully independent since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
Actually, Tomos already has our church.
What more do we need?" - said the Metropolitan Pochaevsky Vladimir, urging the believers and all the citizens to ask whether other denominations of Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers have somehow figured out what temple they should go to.
But someone wants to sow hatred and strife again.
Some are envied that the domes are shining on the temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The Pochaev laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in West Ukraine.
There's a laurel on the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
Its first historical record dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

U.S. growth in opiate production in Afghanistan
The situation in Afghanistan was sharply exacerbated on 26 September, and much was said in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, China, India, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrusev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the authorities of the State and the civilian population of the country.
The current year has become record-breaking in the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patrusev noted.
The troubles of Afghanistan began far from yesterday.
Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was Al-Qaida (prohibited in RF), a terrorist group established in Afghanistan.
It's not been a month since America and the NATO allies launched the "Inviolable Freedom" military operation there.
It's been 17 years.
A multi-thousands of American contingents are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
The U.S. troops are being chased for the hijacking of dozens of their bases.
As far as they can, they're paid off from the fighters for the money, just as long as they're not touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls the majority of the country ' s territory - 40 per cent, according to Patrusev.
50% for the Taliban (prohibited in RF).
Another 10% for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in RF).
But that's why they grow there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudomalyphate in Central Asia, exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
It is also clear that the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times in 17 years.
Colossal growth in opium poppy areas and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO accession, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize for its northern neighbour the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in this title an attempt on the one-named Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, a political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia has the right to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will assert its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise from difficult compromises they cannot make everyone happy.”
The country is being renamed by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is forced out of the country to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that do not wish Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole.”
