Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in its amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected the attempt to repeal the article condemning the opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be inconvenient.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is the political seat of the regime; in the West, the process is also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Qaddafi buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to identify the winners.
In general, Islamists are defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has become a follower of the customary Shariat law, which we have heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the penalty for stealing is the cutting off of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be joined by the Koran.
There will be a order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and probably would not have been the case, for example, with the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters have received help from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse was that they believed that the attacks of NATO were not directed by an American general, but by God, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies were ridded of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of benefit.
In view of recent sad experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Although without occupation, will the oil companies receive Libya’s black gold for practically no price?
Probably won't, and then the West will finally be able to throw in a useless civil rights defense.
Unless Shariah's followers put an end to this.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are currently focusing on investors.
The statistical storm took place over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP data in the 3rd quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, Germany and France showing growth.
Still, the debt market is record-breaking today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter in which Germany was doing better than expected (increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the initial 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (determining information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in stagnation, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than predicted by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, in the third quarter, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts ' projections.
Greece ' s economy showed a preliminary reduction of 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching the critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to face difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the income of the Czech 1-year bond remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Parliamentary has been selected to join EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million cash prize.
The national team has successfully completed the most challenging challenge of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and beautiful goal of Peter Yirachek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second time of the Czech team, it was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after the home game, and it will participate again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the match and prepared a detailed report.
There's practically nothing remarkable about the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the heroic Yiraček; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed Montenegro's team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanović and Vucinic became the most unsuccessful match couple since they missed two wonderful opportunities.
The magnificent Petar Czech is one of the reasons why the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the very first minute, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty with the combination; most of the time, they went to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of first-time owners, and further attacks on the line of defence were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they want to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, a petition for death from both the United States and Israel followed the prayers of the students before entering the building.
In Isphahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a living shield around the Isphahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything indicated that Iran had not left the attempt to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, a petition for death was followed by both the United States and Israel at the entrance of the Isphahan uranium enrichment plant.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of Iran ' s nuclear programme, the objectives will be, according to the Israeli press, an installation in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between 9 and 13 years of age weigh more than normal; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent are obese.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and patterns of behaviour accompanying a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children who suffer from obesity ate French fries at dinner before a survey of an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but this applies to most of the families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, with nearly 900 elementary school students participating throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident during the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students in the 4-8 classes have joined the project.
Proper food and sufficient exercise are the main determining factors that cause the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either excess weight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day, according to the breakfast-breakfast-breakfast-breakfast scheme, and this is one of the essential conditions of proper nutrition,” says one study.
No lunch and sausage at dinner.
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast time are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren have breakfast together.
In most families, they all have separate breakfasts.
The worst discovery was that people don't eat breakfast in every tenth family.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study showed that hot foods are more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet coolant every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is more than halved, up to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were invited to prepare their own menus based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"According to Czech children aged 12-15 is far from ideal for healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of nutritious, meaty, and sweet dishes.
“The high popularity of sweet coolant drinks is a particular concern,” says the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta beat the bird with a small overhang.
However, children had little interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Pursuing a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided that information was provided to them.
“Many participants in the study’s monitoring group showed a significant shift in the preference for healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after the lecture Obesity was not an accident,” the project concluded.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet coolant drinks, more children began to prefer just water.
In addition, children were more likely to notice the bird and the fish as the main dish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking.
Stilist should also be a good psychologist, according to professionals
In the first article on training for stylists, I visited the level of information induction classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lessons from three experts in this field; advice on how to choose clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it works in real life.
More, more, more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alanka, the director, (no man is on course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not entirely symmetrical.
One short neck, another boy’s figure without proper shape, weighs more than one.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e., those with a more luxuriant chest and thigh and a narrow waist, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in waist and thigh size is so great that it is impossible to pick up skirts or trousers, it is worth having at least one item sewn to order.
Clearly, you will not regret the money invested, since ideally sitting clothes are priceless.
In an orderly dress, you will feel much better than the one that keeps coming, rolling, naked, etc.
Male figures, on the other hand, may wear clothing with robes, application, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've had a week to realize all this.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much given the homework we got.
Each participant had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity, day and night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you may know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy for myself because her clothes are much simpler than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who has recently improved in tone (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or quite young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut clothes from magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphic programs.
Mudboard -- so called the result -- then it reflects our own style and attitude to graphic imagery.
It's important to keep the graphic element of style in mind.
The stylist does not simply dress real people but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on types of figures, was revived by three professional guests in this area.
Stilist, Honza Pokorné; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat can be worn in a normal way, above jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without a button like a dress.
Another option is to roll up your sleeve or lift your collar, and the whole picture changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Whatever the case, I appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
Here I finally figured out why we're going to put together all the definitions and rules, what to do with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see quite different things.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylist must have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten sets) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, clothes often look and work in conjunction with others, not as they do in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that often the image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards stylists in the Czech Republic remains quite cold.
Even well-known people often think it's superfluous (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to expect them to call us a different size (less) than the size they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity fatness/weakness, etc.
On Sunday, Honzá and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for a stylist to learn fashion and be able to pick up.
Our job is mainly to communicate with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to judge people, not to mistreat them, and to hold their own opinion.
"If the manager asks you to examine her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe, tell her her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you can praise, and advise that you can carry along with them," Mario says.
He also showed us that a working bag should be included.
It's a bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rollers or English pins, there should be a nylon thread (stylers use it when taking pictures of certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (stitches and similar objects are prohibited because they break clothes) or a sewing set.
To get away from lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to make the right shoelaces.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged -- not to mention street shots.
And here we are doing the glue.
You don't have to touch the shoes with scissors so you don't mess them up.
That requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario commended my work.
Those skills didn't come to my mind.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambition was to some extent satisfied, but that is not important, since no one clearly wanted to do too much work.
Before leaving the new version with the title "Fleece" they had high hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As often happens with the NFS, in the end much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an inexplicable web of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're becoming part of a story whose main hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
There are some interesting features to this idea.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race runs on its own route, and individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there is no feeling that the same thing is happening all the time.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is nice to look at some routes.
Still, the game does not give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs, or in the snowy mountains, it is a pleasure.
In addition, the race is sometimes revived by an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you find yourself in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to get under the avalanche.
Individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you try to outrun a few rivals (in fact, the usual race); then you try to improve time (the standard race with the meter); or you compete with one opponent.
Among other things, you encounter police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack's running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the buttons he needs at the right time.
It's not that hard.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game, because it doesn't suit you; given the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The racing model follows previous models.
That means she's no longer something special, but that can't be considered a disadvantage.
If you're looking for an imitation of real life, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Still, this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic racing, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, so good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driver's model, the collision model isn't so good.
You don't expect complex changes and collisions from a game like this, but if you have no idea how your car will behave, something will happen.
Usually, if you drive or drive past a car in a traffic jam, you sometimes touch another car a little bit, and yet sometimes in a similar situation your car starts to spin.
Or it would crash.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but that's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you crash or get away from the route, the game will bring you back to the point where it broke.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn a certain part of the race.
An important flaw in the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars at a certain location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see your opponent passing easily between two vehicles moving in the opposite direction, while when you are going there, the cars are already in such a position that you need to either drive around or drop speed.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's all arranged that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
There are other advantages to rivals.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same rival is chasing you in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Apparently, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The fact is, when he's ahead of you, he's making your review worse, which leads to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it is rapidly starting to cause irritation.
It's a shame, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what you don't miss -- a concept with fifty unique routes, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the fillings on the way, because it's on them that your car can change, even though in most cases what you already have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for direct cuts of the road; and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain routes.
The main story mode is closely related to the mode challenge; these are the races on individual sites that you will learn from the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to the regimes of challengers and story.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels, starting with cars and completing profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players and provides communication to the public.
Here is another flaw that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (we'll assume so), where you're running on the tracks in the dark (we'll assume so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we'll assume so), when you suddenly get hit by a subway train, turning your car into a scrap metal.
For a few days, our editors discussed whether, at the time of the game, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really thought we were such morons.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even shocking.
Although it is unfortunate that, at some critical times, the quality of the recording sometimes decreases quite strongly.
This is particularly true of events involving a large number of participants, where a good record would not be particularly helpful to you either.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's a fan.
To please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'entered compositions of different styles'; but few people would buy the game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: It ran pretty messy.
If the game avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that the escape is the best part of the NFS over the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of inadequacy.
Of course, it's a good time, but get ready for the flaws to blind you like an airport searchlight.

EU Ambassador Vicenova:
The Czechs have the reputation of being unwelcome and skeptical of the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has led to considerable differences between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect it to be such a cruel war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes in any way, calms down and all players become accustomed to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture in the Faculty of Law.
She demonstrated how much she adhered to her motto “Clear and Open About Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and relations between them so simply and understandablely that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law would envy it.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
“At first, critics said that he was a regular gray office mouse who couldn’t play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he did with his role.”
“He who can listen at the same time to twenty-seven participating countries is good to communicate with them and has a clear idea of which way the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security issues as the answer to the question "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; that is, as an important step towards unifying and making the Union's policy on countries such as China or India more transparent.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
Vicenova continued to focus on an EU-led programme in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success last year.
The Czechs have faced an emerging financial crisis; they have overcome this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused great damage to the Czech Republic.
Czechs in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing rejection.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economical, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and what would be smaller; all those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she had brought to Brussels: “O Europe, the Understandable Language”.
"I really don't like cutbacks, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people do not try to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our kinds of cheese.'
It is also going to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
A Versatile Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are viewed as Euro-sceptics, as well as people who are more negative than positive.
It wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believed that there were several factors involved: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; while there was little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech presidency, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Trust me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the French next to me says, 'Hey, what about the assembly, the Visegrad Group again?' and he's not happy about it.'
In the future, the Vicenova Union is largely awaiting new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea to be two-speed, if not more realistic, Europe.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to should be united, while those who did not want could stay away."
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will indeed be a two-speed Europe,” Vicenov expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in promoting the rule that all issues relating to the EU as a whole should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM innovator enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be "long."
IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution for the general public; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's debt was founded by its first boss, Thomas J. Watson Senior Dreamer.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan “Thomas! ” thus became a stamp around which the life of a future giant (as well as the name of his internal journal, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the basis of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years we hope to achieve even more," says current leader Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson raised the issue of taking care of employees, just as Batia in the Czech Republic, IMB staff members were among the first US employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship between IBM and consumers is the same.
From the very beginning, the company has found a brighter application of talented people, one of the world's first companies to eliminate all discrimination, which has given it an excellent choice.
It agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which the woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations occur.
No wonder a lot of ideas work in the company for about half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm's strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, IBM was more an organization than a technology company," said the Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosebeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve technology-using business problems," adds George Cologne of Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It appears to be the most universal technology company, developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of its staff received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second largest technology company this year (first place is Apple), after overcoming Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all its products came from buyers and entered the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online Prodigy service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by movement, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it gives them up.
This differs, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Forward-looking technology
IBM's main income is derived from services, about one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with capital less than twice as much, she was the strongest manufacturing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, and at the same time, it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have caused no harm to the current crisis.
Since early 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen to a record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will be able to cope.
IBM history: from a raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original title, "Cutting, Tabulation, Recordings" was quite complex.
It called IBM in 1924, originally called a brand used for the offices of Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were based on a merger of four companies whose history began in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies, such as legendary “table clocks”, i.e. clocks that set the time when staff members came and left their jobs.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the company’s board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the CEO of a rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then disassociated the founder of IBM into a shadow - Watson's ideas remain the foundation of an inviolable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the title, began from the production and sale of various business equipment - from raw knives and carnivores to cashiers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, profits doubled to $9 million, and the company’s extensive expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the principal's chair was occupied by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his guidance, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In 1960, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 - to fly a human being to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined computer standards at the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, while buying PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high value added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to use technology wisely in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a research group at the world level for speech recognition.
Richtarjova about her unfaithful husband:
Yvette, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova, 53, said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarz, 53, became the bodyguard and lover of Yvette Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she did not want to wait any longer and set forth clear rules for her future life.
"The Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Richtarzov explained.
When Darina Richtarchov offered Bartoshova’s blood in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave Rjican 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to be reconciled to her husband's novel; and now she's finally saying goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richterge and Bartoshova ever break up, his wife won't take him with her arms stretched out.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out."
"However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as the person with whom he links me," Richtarzov said, adding that she had already been freed from her husband and insisted only on the two.
As long as Joseph has no objection to his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm going to be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union continues to function; I am responsible for repairs, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly perfectly, except we don't share a bed anymore," said Richtarj to the magazine Blesk.
He claims that if Richtarchova finds new love, he won't interfere.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a friend with.
I know it's my fault, I've fallen in love with Yvette and I'm fully responsible," Joseph concluded.
The Worst Women’s Habits — Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, will you know yourself in the following lines, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains that you guys go shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one item every week?
Do you like to do big sales shopping?
If so, your shopping may be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they must somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, which one of you is going to give up walking around clothing stores looking for ideally sitting clothes and fitting them in different color options?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but it can be hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five pounds -- maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still drawn to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you have to stop following yourself, but many men are literally allergic to constant complaints by their mate.
The strong sex also agrees that the more frequent such complaints arise, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Mocha glass, vacuum cleaner, floor cleaning, dusting, bath cleaning, at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for going to a clean coffee shop in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this “disadvantages, ” try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that your family should not have order and cleanliness in the first place.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your family.
Desire to Command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood it, women would not have to command them so often...
Condensed
Some women like to gossip, insult, and gossip against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, each one of us is likely to break loose.
Let's be honest, that's the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious conspiracies, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
Effective broadcasts by Jagra and Voracek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two effective handovers of the hockey striker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Caroline.
In both cases, Claude Jiro used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transmission and was named the best player of the match.
Two effective matches were also held by Jagru Yakubu Voracek, who played in one team.
After the match, Jagar told foreign journalists that he had foretold a wonderful evening for Jir.
"I told him before the game he'd kill the hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," explained Jagre, after whose actions Gira scored the goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave her.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech trail".
The closing Harrickins Voraček captured the Shibay and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who killed between circles.
One second before the first break, the home gamer Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with many advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, Flyers again took off.
Especially Jiro.
After Jagra’s successful delivery, he scored the third goal; then his shot was turned into Wayne Simmons’ fourth goal.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely in the top three," said Jagre, praising his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Routus and the Penalta Dwyer, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who widened the gap to two points.
"Pronger has done great in our area."
"He hit the pike, I speeded up, and Reed moved on to the far end."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," Vorachek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The team defender of Montreal of the Czech Republic, Jaroslav Spaček, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to injuries to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the penalty series.
Thomas the Grief couldn't have been killed during one of their attacks.
More than the lost points, the home coach was bitter with a large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended only with five defenders.
"It's a bad situation."
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Whatever it is, we can't do anything about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"In exchange, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
“What was our weak side,” added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, the Czech Golkiper Onjay Pavelez helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The naked Jets, who interrupted the five-point series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Travel price dynamics since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourist agencies at the time were mainly selling tours to the Socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists took vacations to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav regime then returned to the West, which imposed significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise it was not possible to travel individually.
At the time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but it was either to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have good friends in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was necessary for travel to the West, and was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
The Czechs often spent their vacations at home, leading to a large number of cottages and summer homes, which is still a practice.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived the real revolution.
While prior to 1989 vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs held 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that before 1989 we were unable to visit Croatia freely, the most popular one, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In early 1990, the need for a visa to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe had been lifted, with the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough travel to the West.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income was not enough at the hotel or boarding house at the time.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring its own food (conservations, halls, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown, and decades later our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income increased, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed tourist agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines, and compared to the previous one, flights have now become incredibly cheap owing to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, we didn't need a visa to visit virtually all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of the post-revolution journeys occurred in 2000 and a great demand led historically to the first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will take 12 exotic routes.
About 100,000 Czechs now visit exotic countries every year!
And yet another important development of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus forever joined the most developed world countries.
For the first time in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person while abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly must elect the President, the threat of the road returns
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Gashek, head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of elections to be followed.
Without that vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Instich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta, and Tomas Paclik yearn to lead Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong figure who would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Gashek era has again loaded football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly of Mind came to the National House in Prague, Smichov, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly - only legitimate representatives or officials who had been given the power.
That point had since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that a delegation based on authority could not be authorized.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been very helpful, although it is primarily concerned with this issue at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary.
Views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round 3 and avoid the road?
“The issue is whether to follow established standards or find another model,” says one of the Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dusan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for in the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received great support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to have agreed to compromise to consider the candidate to be the winner of the election with the highest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the overall percentage, the winner should receive at least two thirds of the votes.
“Therefore, two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers”, freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Suddenly, Thomas Paclik agreed with his view, although it was estimated that the electoral rules defined by the Charter were more suitable for Pelta than for other candidates.
"I'd like the election to go as well as possible."
“I want to avoid all possible representational nonsense, as at the previous general meeting,” said Victoria Plzen, the owner of the first candidate; and in his statements he largely contradicted Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new President would become known in Nimburk; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional abandonment will be calmed after today's expected National Assembly at the European Championship."
“Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate,” says the representative of Jablonets, who has the most experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Reichle's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
“This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules.”
"This could cause another collapse of the general assembly."
"I hope that common sense wins," said Reichl.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
Some reports indicate that separate negotiations have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be carried by the vice-presidents of Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to technical failure; they sought an alternative to transport a part of the executive committee to the venue of the game.
After all, meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can become decisive.
Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobesh, would like the opponents of the country ' s strongest sports association to reach an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football creditability; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech Sports Directorate following Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik enters the presidential struggle because he sees no suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football team, Plzeň Tomas Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the President of the Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR), he would not even have applied for a high position.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight."
"But we haven't found one yet," said Paclik ČTK.
Paclik's motive to fight Miroslav Pelt and Yindrajich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from entering the FAČR.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that if he wins, he will remain President only until 2013, when another general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager who is not too connected with football life.
"I've spoken to a number of people who could be remembered."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that they do not even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that opinion," he said.
Paclik's main disagreement with Pelt is now related to the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berbr is a man of conflicting reputation, known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the votes of delegates of the general assembly.
Paclik thus considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become President.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," Paclik said.
He points out that several years ago the name Pelta was recorded during the wiretap of the corruption case; Pelta managed to escape the sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of winning Pelta would bring football."
“And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclik, who now does not mention his previous statement that he would “sell the Plzen Club if Pelta became president”.
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I could turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
“I don’t have a nose for what I don’t understand either,” said Paclik, who drew a great deal of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he managed the Plzeň team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
“To limit the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to repulsive situations,” said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta, Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FACR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points for the new president to take."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Paclik does not consider his connection to the Plzeň Club to be a burden, although he claims that the President of the FACR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Appleman, and Richle's connected to the Prague Ducleus.
"This isn't the perfect option."
"And yet I see no point in the hypocritical handover of my actions at the Plzeň Club to someone else when I'm going back in six months," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would avoid Election Pat
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was chosen, he would fight for new FACR rules in order to avoid future disputes over the rules of election.
Prior to Thursday's negotiations in Nimburk, Jablonetsa's official remains optimistic and believes that attention from the pre-election struggle will be a tangible distraction to today's expected success with our football team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelt promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last minute before the last general meeting, a two-month delay could thus be useful for him to build his ideas on football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be famous on Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to head the association," claims a man, mainly connected with the Jablonets Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believed that the current problems were caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
“Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June.”
“If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September,” said Pelta.
He referred to the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental issue that we cannot exist without," Pelta says.
Besides, he says he's not trying to separate himself from his rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Yinstih Reichl, whom he appreciated for his legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paczik, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's had some success."
"Whatever the case, his attacks were rude, and many people surprised his campaign methods."
“And that is why some of them now question his true identity,” said Pelt about his competitor. Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations that he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon to be the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to national gatherings.
The national team should represent all football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the gods or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Right after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for all football”, the 40-year-old candidate said to ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the football chapter would not entail the dismissal of the staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." It was his message to Stratovo, where an extended period of inter-government is causing understandable nervousness.
Despite the current disastrous scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believed that the delegates would not come to Nimburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust it can gain only by finally choosing its leader," says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership the FACHR will work actively
If, at the meeting on Thursday, the Reich, acting vice-president, became president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association would be unhappy.
Richle promises that if he's chosen, there'll be a hard time.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national football, professional football and football events for young people”.
"I don't want to say that I will do everything myself," said Reichl in his interview with the Czech Republic.
“I am a team player, and I want to allocate powers to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a particular area.”
"I will carefully assign tasks so that in each of these segments, football can take big steps forward."
"This is probably not something that many people will like because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who stick sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"However, many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
"This is a trust I cannot deny," he said.
Moreover, he said that his motivation was to continue the work he had begun with Gashek.
"More work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all out."
"Procedures have been initiated that can produce results in a few years' time, and I do not want anyone else to stop them," he said, afraid that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's hardly the case with Mirek Pelt."
"He's surrounded by people who would do football so that he'd only be available for the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but it's definitely not subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Reichl.
Moreover, he refutes the charges of being solely the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to claim otherwise, I intend to make the most of it for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into Czech and Moravian parts whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
“This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia,” said Reichl.
While the manager of the Plzen Club, Tomas Paclik, has entered the presidential battle, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
“However, I continue to feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success,” said Reichl. In his success, he is saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiating contracts with television and negotiating a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blamed himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta had been “disbarred from the process of restoring creditworthiness to Czech football”, he considered another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who had something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he's done a great job in Plzen this year."
"If it is chosen, I hope that it will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant changes in the committee staff."
"He would not distort the facts for his own benefit," Reichl said of his rival.

She was in a hurry to add each favorite pool to her notebook, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The architect of Meder visited more than 200 swimming pools, and now gained impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing), where everything went from the public pools in Munich to the historical bath palaces in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the swimming pools in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bath culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but everything else is in the water.
The only drawback is that swimmers should accept the blue coffee plate and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the scent of the waves of forests or listen to the joyous chirping of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible," said the Vienna-based Meder.
"That's how I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splash in the pool and the oil in the sauna are such a health factor in the baths because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to the eyes if the builders take on such work.
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visible: high ceilings, colored tiles and tramples.
The illustrated edition of The Joys of Bathing on 190 pages contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oasis - and makes you want to jump into the water.
The Meder water collector found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
It discovered a large nitrate-rich water cave (Mishcoltz-Tapolce Cave) and a thermal bath filled with tap water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jasberen), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Siechen Baths in Budapest.
From many heated open swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an amazing view. You can see all of Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there is a steaming window that allows you to see what is going on in the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimsuits in Langenfeld. The Ectal Aquashed looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open coffins appear to be very small in the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwalde
The Meder pool collector did not have the smell of chlorine in each pool.
Many thermal baths smell like gray, Arpad baths in Bekeschba smell so much oil, you may find it hard to believe that you are in a healing source.
The smell is caused by the hydrocarbons in the tap water, the water is almost black from the eel that clings to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool, the healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing sites, and when she tried to visit the open pool of Czech swimming pools in Lugačovici, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked at the red-white-yellow window in the ar-nuvo style, she saw weeds growing between the brown tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palace of thermal waters in Bud Wildbad.
You will find not only neo-Romanian elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Mauritanian hall in Algambira style, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder basin, and not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement: it is so masterful to combine such different architectural styles," said Meder.
Digging into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a minor exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the world ' s poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of those interviewed demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people in the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis by the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Schumann, demonstrates that gambling at world commodity markets raises prices - and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The Consumer Protection Campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also trading.
At first, prices of goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have renounced the rules of supply and demand and are profiting from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results would be submitted to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may fall or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector.
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“The Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money on food prices,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Akkermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but the Director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before his stay at the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman would not proceed to the monitoring board as planned.
The elimination of contentious speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little need to care for expenses, and the consequences will have to be borne by his successor.
One out of two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 participants participated.
No more than 11 per cent consider that investments that place a price on food are acceptable to the Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found out that their bank was involved in such a trade.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century Home in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Winsovski
The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was desolate and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms of glass halls, boldly expressing faith in technological progress.
Pavillion Schwanzera won Grand Prix in 1958 for his lightweight steel and glass burning structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, he celebrated the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and its sister, a glass - shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the southern station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - and often referred to as the 20th century House for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang works of art and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna was given a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has now restored a pavilion called the 21st Century House and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Belvedere Museum's office, which will open the first exhibition Tuesday night, in all respects, a joyous event.
Agnes Husslain-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslain-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career in youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to include a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votuba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore, along with modern art, and a office building was also to be built.
Strict Control of & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Cecession of Joseph Olbrich and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer University of Vienna technology, and the pavilion was “an extremely important place” for him, where he attended exhibitions “at least every week”.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood before the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was “a sink of energy, ” says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass fibre reinforced safe glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-strength safety glass.
The permanent translations of the thermal bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, which is lit by a light well between the building and the street, providing lighting - a virtually new building, but still an exquisite pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in an old red and brown color protection against corrosion.
The theater hall is the same as it used to be.
All of this with strict control of museum management and a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum,” said Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite constraints, problems and transformations.
Krishnanitz recently noted that the Brussels pavilion was a rough one, a typical story of "charves in the city".
This architecture is “always out of place” and nevertheless wants to “encourage real awareness”.
The 21st-century house is in a very good place, because there was an unexpected luck in the planning of the city, a completely remodeled headquarters with offices and residential properties growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may take place: the 21st century house may be complemented by the second Krishanitz building - the collector of Francesca von Gabsburg acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city its location in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the abolition of trains in winter.
The number of staff should double.
Costs will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to the internal crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the Bild newspaper reports that an investment of around 300 million euros is planned by 2015.
Investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed and engaged personnel involved in snow-sleeved off roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice to work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and delaying trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
In the past winter, Deutsche Bahn faced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as she lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
The approval of the Federal Railway Service was expected for many new regional trains of years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check ICE train axles much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fine in the U.S.
The new trouble came after the unrest surrounding Josef Akkermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds.
Like Deutsche Bank, there were few problems at home, and the past of the industrial giant in the United States now drove him away. Deutsche Bank with headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million ($106 million) to settle the disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Office (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to deceive credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and brought down credit unions.
“We are glad that we have resolved this problem without bringing the parties to court,” said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit its guilt.
The same is true of Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Office (NCUA), is responsible for US credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumers' contributions.
The NCUA is fighting for damages that come from billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and launched a case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Suspicious mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgages.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble exploded in the US real estate market in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the reef of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The biggest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of acquiring US credit agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by FHFA on numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for “substantial losses” but not yet specify the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
The financial guru Baffet is actively investing in IBM IT.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, America's largest investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that it does not invest in computer and IT companies, as long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view on investments in the industry.
According to Baffett, he had to have realized much earlier that IBM offered services and purchased computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Baffett's investments were seen as a knightly act.
IBM, an IT veteran, has now been named Sir IBM.
In an interview with the U.S. business channel CNBC Baffett reported that since March he had acquired IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management, which had been able to achieve profits even during the financial crisis.
"They have done a great job," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
Significant IBM time has been concentrated on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claimed he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old has acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and has built one of the most expensive companies in the world with the help of skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest.
Made it a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost infallible instinct for making money brought him the name "Omaha Oracle".
The price of IBM shares increased by one percent before the opening of markets after Buffett's investment was announced.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is still called, stands on the stock market for over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of the "rats in Zwickau", Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a “blood ideology” that now rises again to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a true extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears, and similar right-wing attacks on Turks have not occurred since the arsons in Melna in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network currently discovered has a scale that is not yet fully aware.
"Rebirth of Bloody Ideology?" was the title of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk's Internet version.
The Sabah newspaper notes, on the other hand, that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly by mentioning the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket across from the Brandenburg Gates this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Berlin community celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a treat. “A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary” is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish web portal Haber X, a commentary on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of a column by Ahmed Kullahji.
He noted that people who had paid taxes had been killed and had made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
Police behaviour and subsequent successful raids were severely criticized by German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors asked why the German authorities had not previously considered following suspects in the right-wing community.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. “If they continue to act as incoherently, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves.”
"It'll be the best self-defense."
“Peace in Germany depends very heavily on how the entire network is exposed and on the legality of the punishment,” writes Selen.
The crimes in Melna and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the world in Germany.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply entrenched in the memories of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown so obvious to the Turks here that they are in danger and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can be exposed to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do Not Repeat the Mistakes of the Past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Melna.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the Zolingen fires, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It was as if he had determined the value of a human being by the taxes he paid.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German State has since deepened.
Having clearly demonstrated what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate the right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on Zurich Lake
The majority of Europe's risk-taking banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost failed during the financial crisis and has been constantly struggling with one crisis since then.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Webber probably didn't think he'd get that part.
In July, following his effective resignation from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013, he would start working in an equally effective post, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength and made some friendly comments to his future colleagues.
"UBS has changed for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspere Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it was already September that everything was going to be completely different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know when Alex Weber will finally take office?
Weber should have been consulting the bank since February 2012.
And, according to the bank, on Tuesday, the position of President of the Council will already be held in May and not in 2013.
It's gonna be hard for Alex Webber.
He is a professor of economy and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently, it has managed the world's largest assets - and, on the other hand, does not come out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is spared nothing.
It all began during the financial crisis.
Before 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a secretive and sustainable but also a hunting asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money to manage than any other bank in the world,
As an investment bank, he became the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has long taught at the Zurich University Banking Institute, explains: “I always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank”.
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
Only in 2007 did it become clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the executive director, Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and to the same extent a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in capital to counter the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors from whom many bankers would have recently been politely refused - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden so much that its name has not even been reported.
It was just the first punch.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second-in-arms chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, there was a disaster: the lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis threatened to collapse, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a converted bond with a mandatory convertible bond to become a bank owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the large banks in a small country.
Finally, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times higher than all production of Switzerland (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says Bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transfer data from a well-established client who may have been tax-absorbed by a bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of the reimbursement of undue business income plus fines.
UBS thus acknowledged more or less that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich customers, the curtain of secrecy.
After that scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money has started to go out.
In a few months, the bank had lost confidence in both its main areas of activity - investment due to failed speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the promotion of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down and it seemed that UBS was able to break the situation as the trade-trader affair happened, and a single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly, the risk management of the investment division is not yet working.
“The incident with Adoboli has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough”, says Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it does not have a risk control tool”.
It is the precaution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world ' s largest assets, not an excessive risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss banks' safes have become a symbol of irresistible reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her mood is in itself a classic.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich, Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss Confiserie Sprüngli shops, jewelry companies like Tiffany's can be found here.
The Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Palace of Creedy Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Bar.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble walls are large leather sofas, next to the emblem of the bank, a large indicator of Safe.
UBS knows what his clients need, reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point gave up Swiss concepts of banking -- or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large, in particular in an investment banking where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, they've adapted long ago to Anglo-Saxon customs."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it the first major profits, and then the fiasco, and no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster was apparent on 15 October 2008.
“On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” writes Lucas Hessig in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If they ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
It also helped that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other, one being a rich but graduated bank specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an all-powerful wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wulfley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says Bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and profoundly understanding model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, which went all the way up from an intern in a bank."
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees well remember meetings of members of the board, at which Wulfley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed a “tourboard” to which the success of the banks had been achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in the trade in currency and government securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot, which in banking terminology is referred to as “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS became involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in US substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on US mortgages and sold them further, continuing to bear risks.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS purchased until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says Bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave the other as the bank tried to get it in order was harder than it seemed at first.
The UBS posts have become a child's chair game and remain unreliable to date.
Anyone who heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far yet.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be severely narrowed down.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact only considered a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor Grubel.
Over the past time, he has been able to show character and now, according to Tukih Bank, heads UBS on a permanent basis on Tuesday.
Ernesti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Webber.

Fears of recession in Europe are being brought down by the American Stock Exchange
The on-going recession in Europe made the mood of American investors worse at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The overall relief that followed the changes of Governments in Rome and Athens was not sustained.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty -- but now the problems are back to square one," said Mark Luskini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial exchanges were included in sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a 0.6 per cent drop.
The market barometer during the bidding period ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

Eurostat statistics reported that in September, companies produced less than two per cent than in the previous month.
This message threw American investors into skepticism. "We're not on the island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to shrink rapidly and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns. In an interview with CNBC, he said it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything it needed to end the crisis.
In his view, therefore, it was too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw the principle of the past decade into the garbage bin and invested in the American high-tech industry.
Its investment in IBM of more than $10 billion raised the price of shares of this older company by almost one percent against the trend during the trade.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.

Designed crows fill cities
Players are considered to be troublesome birds in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be driven out of the cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and crows have been part of the city landscape for centuries, but residents who complain about dirt and noise are becoming more and more populated.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first crow symposium in Lar, Eastern Frision, experts claimed that a player could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
The conservationists claimed that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of specially protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, the expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees have made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies of more than 600 parental couples in the town of Zest, Westphalia, and in the northwest of Yevere, Dipholce, Ahim under Bremen and Lere.
A mixed project on the shooting of crows in Lere resulted in disapprovalal headlines in 2005.
Critics described the trapping of birds and the stoning of them with sticks of special cruelty.
"Ordinary displacement and intimidation don't do anything." said architect and landscape designer Werner Cleaver of Lear.
The collapse of the water current nest or the cutting of trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Lives are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas.”
It is only possible to be intimidated by the exception of hospitals, older people ' s homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them.
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Keller.
The combination of fear of birds from needing protection of residential areas and their incentive to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stands instead of benzopils" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the Asherberg educational crow route in Schleswig-Holstein, where information on the lives of very crafty players is provided on the newsstands.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion about the noise caused by the birds: “Noise provides a great deal of information; they have much to say to each other.”
The mind and smile of these birds have become legends, and players often use not only their weapons to capture a watchful piece but also make their own weapons.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the bird’s mind on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the board to obtain the larvae of prayer.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the plank.
In another experiment, suitable players had to deal with a more difficult task.
The researchers put a little squirrel with a pencil larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the pick with the beak.
But the researchers did give them a piece of wire.
All four birds used a wire to make hooks and use hooks to stick the squirrel behind the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have been able to do this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro-2012
The hopes of Bosniaks and Turks for the last minute were long overdue.

A former Wolfsburg player from the English champion Manchester City sent a ball of head to the lower edge of the stick for 33 minutes, but the ball didn't cross the gate line.
Iraczek kills for Czech Republic
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergoulding.

After the break of the 2004 European vice-champion, the account was secured by four more goals.
Peter Yiraček has dispeled all remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The European Championships of 1976 are going to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
The success was also impressed by coach Michael Bilek's team and the Bundesliga legions Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FK Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could be catastrophic.
Gatekeeper Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented the potential goal of Tomas Sívok.
Montenegro had the best chance when Stephen Jovetić and Dejan Damyanović were on the field.
Damyanović struck from the end of the fine and almost scored the Czech goal.
After the break of the band, she saved the already-saved Czech world class goalie after FK Seoul had left the field for the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored right in front of the final whistle.
In the meantime, Turkey was lacking in football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than destroying 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is no doubt now that Coach Gus Hiddink will now be freed from the team bench, reaching third place in 2002, the Croatians will be on the final tour of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost perfectly launched 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan’s far - reaching blow hit the stand for the seventh minute, and Kazim Kazim, the attacker, failed to bounce the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and became more and more in control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
The Bundesligi Legionaries Daniel Pranic (Babaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mandzukic of the Wolfsburg team, who resigned Ivan Perišić of Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattons are coming to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro exit after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team -- who already looked confident in her place after winning 4:0 in the first stage -- took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team compared the account to 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good turn from the start, but only for 23 minutes Robbie Keen of Los Angeles made his first clean head shot.
At the last minute, the Estonian defender was able to prevent him from moving Ireland forward.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China over the next few years.
The company included in Dax reported on Thursday that it was planning to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and take thousands of people to work”, said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.

Mass killings - human dimension
The tense and very good new book by Peter Englund, "The Beauty and Grief: The Personal History of the First World War", begins with a long list of actors from which the heart dies.
Here is a hint: Carefully cut this page out and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund tells you, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at a time when, like one of these men and women, you will be off the road and lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's written right now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "working on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, hunter journalists or discussions on tactics and combat technology.
It's not so much a book about what it was, it explains, it's like a book about what it looked like, it's about feelings, impressions, emotions and the state of the spirit.
The Book of Beauty and Grief has combined the experience of military years with 20 more or less notable men and women, from both sides of the front line, from school girls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people are going to be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses an arm or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are dying here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at that time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a major war on the Western front.
Beauty and Grief is an adept panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
A soldier in the book falls bee hives; one meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which smells of smokeless dust.
When the canon is nearby and you're a woman and you're at home with the kids, will you stay where you are or will you run away?
Either way, who's doing it?
Almost nobody understands what's going on and why we should fight this war.
“The lack of facts”, notes Mr. Englund, “is accompanied by speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours”.
Beauty and Grief follows the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German high seas sailor.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other published material.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to the small moments and details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, all over the ERZAC."
"Deputy coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden collars."
He continues to talk about erzac food in Germany.
He describes “the flesh of the pressed rice boiled in ram fat (and adorned with false bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; the shoe covered with wood”.
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat authorised in the production of sausage, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories speak of honor and courage.
One American notices the drive towards cruelty and says of war: “You feel that, after all, it is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller, and to claim that this display is a civilization and that under your dashed coat of arms there is no barbar.”
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person accepts the thought of self-sacrificing, he would like to think that it will happen to the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's like "a man who's being held in secret."
Other comments relate to the old Europe that is falling apart and to new types of fear.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “the war of factories”.
He notes the arrival of the one he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the early century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-dressed suit, which makes a cut sitting at the desk.”
Humans act in an unpredictable way — as low-level acts as heroes.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who had tried to pick up a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of the gonorrhea dung that the soldiers have bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"He was very desperate to see, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with Swedish Peter Graves prose by Mr. Englund flexible but non-brosic, excellently suited for his humanist task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how war “liberated completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fasselle or novels such as "On the West Front Without Change" by Erich-Marie Remarca, not by exhaustive historical work.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unsainted pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in unartificial literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it was as if he had reached from the book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands, and burned it with a match.
After a previous error - carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there were supposed to be fewer people in Zukotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said they were going to practice.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the event, and his presence stressed the importance of the operations of the Department of Police.
There could not be a repetition of the episodes of the past weeks, such as the use of the gas inventory against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the Department and caused the public ' s sympathy hurricane to the invaders.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to liberate the protestors of the Zukotti Park.
Authorities were preparing to watch occupations unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randels Island, based on Zukotti.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills, counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers, in view of Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came in "last minute," said a source familiar with orders that referred to the task only as "training".
"The few cops I know who were summoned to this case did not say they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One reason for secrecy was the lesson he learned from the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but they withdrew from the hundreds of protesters who had rushed inside before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, various police units were involved, including the police forces from the districts, which were usually used to control the criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went to work during the day, making one hour of the night the right time for their arrival.
"It was right to do so when the park was the smallest people," he said.
The search engines with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlight and prerecorded announcements from loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protestors.
When the park was filled with administrative officers in their blue windshields, many protestors simply packed their belongings and left.
Police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other groups of police officers, according to eyewitnesses, met on a perimeter to enter in case arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a member of the Department of Police, said that this had been done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see how the police work and that the police have treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through the chest of the protestor's personal belongings, including bags, plastic carpets and plastic bags, full of clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what was abandoned.
Some protestors who refused to leave took pictures out, and they soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen, at the centre of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were handcuffed together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “distortion of public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
The most senior officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and a senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's wanted police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, “not in charge of the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police officers was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case they had to enter.
The fences were placed on Courtland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers have seen police expanding the perimeter from these positions even further beyond the borders of Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, were venting air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of fanner flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
A school staff union will be brought to the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff members who lost their seats last month, plans to bring the city to justice on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are enrolled.
The trial is probably the last measure available to the union of the District Council 37, which seeks to abolish dismissals.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, parent and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, Dennis M. Walcott, Chancellor of Schools, said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Board steamed, told him that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a claim notice warning the Department of Education that an action had been brought against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of a complaint with the Supreme Court of the State of Manhattan.
The claim will identify Mr. Walcott and the City ' s Education Department as defendants and list eight suspended employees as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the claim and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint made by the New York Times, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and that there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support workers lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free high school of 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: “These are not areas of well-established parents who can find money to make up for budget failures”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the calculation of additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The trade union also claims that the school director may have been misled by the language of notification allowing parental focal points to be dismissed.
The word “excess” was used in the notification, although “exceeding” was more often referred to when a teacher from the school's payroll was moved to the list of available employees whose salaries were paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parental coordinators were dismissed”, says the lawsuit, “not just transferred.”
Mission over, Congress ready for Libya agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the ancient dictator Muammar Qaddafi was captured and killed and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for their good rebellion and the American troops for their "feelings".
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties."
The language may seem harmless, but no debate on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions authorizing or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing the limited use of the American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the votes of both parties and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would cut the financing of the American operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in a kind of legislative purgatory, when Congress was sufficiently annoyed to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad that it actually kicked the ground out of its feet.
Then the events overcame the irresistibility of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is “admired by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Would the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council or dissect legislators, such as the June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans in the Committee, spoke against the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, this week's House of Representatives should vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives of Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to submit their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been raised in this convening.
Some were duplicated, the same bill being introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate, while others were minor variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of amendments to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and more on “control of federal expenditures”.
Some of them are identical, but give their authors, mostly newly elected republicans, who wish to decorate their summaries, the opportunity to boast that they have "proposed" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the term of office of Congress members, and a member of the House of Representatives of José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to cancel the limit of two terms for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (Democrat, Illinois), proposed many amendments guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to quality education and health care.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as has another banning flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object.
As members of the Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving faster than they have in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110st they made 66.
This pace will be measured from the early 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but was actually made to Congress in 1789.
"Breaked but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after an attempt
Ten months after an armed man fired at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives of Gabriel Giffords (democracy party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel Monday evening, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Back Tomorrow" and said that he wanted to recover more than to return to Congress.
After appearing on the 20/20 program, A.B. News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a hard way to recover from a bullet wound that shattered her skull and pierced her left side of her brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the debt bill.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and called her recovery "hard."
So Sawyer, how does she feel, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special edition of "20/20", which was shown before the release of the new book of "Gabby's Husbands: History of Courage and Hope".
The SWAT team told us about the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists are teaching her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking me to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by Aibi-si shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see the congressman singing with the doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Lauper and "Free Fall" by Tom Patty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she didn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband told her that he was reading the Giffords article in the March 12th newspaper when she stopped him to ask about the six who had been killed.
The suspect, Jerd Lee Lafner, is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to compulsory treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I've been defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," Kelly said.
You're just beaten up.
And you'll get through it, you'll get better and come back stronger than ever.
Troops Feel More Grief Than Respect
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang to the ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines have built around it.
The auditorium in the tuxedo applauded his stand.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, also attended by the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," an officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respectable.
The contrasting impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the army and often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
Soldiers are praised for their sacrifices.
But praises have a price, say the soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are feeling sorry for people in their own form.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and was soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive theme for warlords who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in recent years of war in Vietnam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the grieving talks are quiet and only between veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, Colonel Mark Kenschen warned them that the non-military would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have struck the rebels and have been in exotic places.
Others will wonder whether “a cruel evil veteran is hiding under a mask”, said Kenshin, who had fought in Iraq and returned to a high government position in Washington.
While looking for work, he relates, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could handle the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the fighting.
Kenshn remembers when he said to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to expect a negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military is partly due to the American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was quite normal in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Bernow, who was in command of the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of raids they have carried out, the number of comrades they have lost or the extent to which they have lost.
The Army faces increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, at historic court hearings, it must be decided whether 28 men and women will be brought against the army on charges of non-reaction to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the following.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was allegedly raped at night by her co-worker for 11 weeks of pregnancy.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a male attendant carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But the reaper of Texas overturned her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they walked into Lyman's room, the man came to her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former soldiers will be anxious to await the decision of the court at the historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether or not to bring a lawsuit against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld to court.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C. initially included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened by employees and that the army has not properly investigated, prosecuted or failed to provide justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the highest ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence?
Burke also said that some 400 other victims had contacted her since February, many of whom could participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak -- it will open up a lot of cases if it is necessary to maintain the pressure.
A defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to bring the case to an end.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a defence strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers are unable to file claims against the army for damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by Doctrine Ferres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in the words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the area of combat.
Result: 150 female soldiers died in the period between the two wars, two thirds of them fighting.
It's time for the armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies accused of promoting a woman-involved atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against an army at the centre of which the diagnosis of “change of personality” is made by victims of violence to eliminate them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Organization of Action of Women Soldiers.
Her group filed a complaint against the Office of Veterans in December accusing him of discriminatory practices in dealing with pension applications from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during service.
Nine separate drafts proposing a number of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 attempts of rape were reported to the Ministry of Trafficking's Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service.
However, it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases came before the court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Berk case refer to the attacks as only the first in a number of other injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times the fiancée of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a kit of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker - from the cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing during which she was asked whether she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave positive characteristics to the accused, who was ultimately justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby now, and I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial on him, it was a trial on me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality changes, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in unfavourable language, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
If the case brought forward by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs is a complex issue, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “I think they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've been criticizing Dr. Ferres my whole life.
The army has been behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "The odds are high against them ... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
The walls have eyes: as researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new person of true extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Brayvik was an ordinary guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Brayvik, who was aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, which killed 77 people, appeared at his first open court hearing.
Although Brayvik could have acted alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, talking to millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can you find them?
It's easy to just go on Facebook.
“We realized that it was not difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on the European cyber-populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The availability of personal data on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketologists have been doing so for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then advertised to them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, advertising invited the user to conduct a survey on their levels of education, violence and optimism regarding their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to request more than 10,000 participants from 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so impressive: online rights groups are mostly young men of the male sex, dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor."
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and political scientists use the site to explore everything in the world, ranging from health to social trends, expressed in the Leikas, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three entries a day, Facebook’s “super-current information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the site’s headline by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"More recently, if you wanted to ask the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett said.
"Facebook excludes all of this -- you're talking to them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and study social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno assumes that students’ peers, such as their dormitory instructors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating drunken status.
“You cannot solve the problem without identifying it,” said Washington Post-Dmitry Christikis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify children from a group of risks they wouldn't otherwise have found."
Facebook also constantly extracts data about its users.
The website ' s data processing team has processed statistics on the status of relations and Valentine ' s Day, voter turnout in mid-2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information only available to them), the cyber freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not -- in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for off-line research, online data are publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have thought at least that the researcher can monitor their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, of the study he conducted in 2006 using the public websites of students on Facebook.
"As they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
There is a question of methodology.
Even offline has no guarantee that the object of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information is true in the profile and on the user page.
"What you're saying on Facebook, and what you're doing outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," Selvin says.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available.
“Nothing can replace the exit to real peace and communication with real people,” he said.
“Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still happening offline.”
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Brayvik will be publicly brought before the court for the first time
Anders Bering Brayvik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights of the Templars of Norway”, he said to 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit actions, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torquel Nesheim interrupted Brayvik during this monologue because he “did not want to give Brayvik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views”.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brayvik, who brought the pre-written speech, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Brayvik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Brayvik in the eyes, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian channel NRK one of the survivors of Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but it was a little easier for me myself after I saw and heard the suspect."
Brayvik, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, kept his peace and professionalism calm throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Braevik's strange idea that he was part of a great movement of “resistance”, the judge decided that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with his accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But it does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is experiencing.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if that were the case."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview that show up at the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider to be the greatest discovery in a recent interview that was recently discovered, which was mentioned in advance of preliminary demonstrations in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and in manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he thought he was hippie, but he was also an up-to-date organizer and designer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “sickness to think that a really big idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a great deal of artificial work”.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley was creating a series of Triumph Nerves about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he was already working at his new NeXT computer company in anticipation of a massive Internet development.
While a small portion of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were missing in transport.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This film, slightly edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs, a lost interview that took place in the Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person known for hating a detailed interview, Jobs here seems unusually prepared to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are great intervals between questions and answers -- reflections for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be precise.
There are also moments in which the perfectionism of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems to be the irritated questions of Kringley, which make it move faster towards issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, iPods and iPhones, the Lost Interview has something more ominous prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technology.
It's one thing to read about the postmortem evaluation of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer at the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things they could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize Apple reporting.
Disturbed by the way the cost recording was often started with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then driven by “definition”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business spending until it was too small.
About the joke over the Pope:
Jobes tells us in detail about the blue box he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively break into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
The device was written a lot earlier, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the blue box as an act of power is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using an auto phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe a half dozen times, and you've been yelling at the phone machine, and it's only been a minute later in the next phone machine," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever have appeared.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one of the famous occasions that he and Wozniak had practically managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for Pope's phone to do their best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two were struck by laughter right before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About being in love with technology (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he found Bill Hülett in a phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at the Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they are with their employees."
Jobs later became a member of HP's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP when I was a teenager and go around that car and write programs for her.
Improvised innovation:
In several places, the Jobes interview is about inventing new products in the summer.
In the early hours of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days in credit, he had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple he remembers the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember angry arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up with my throat, and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could raise for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
Big companies that lose energy:
Long before he headed Apple's resurgence, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would fail to see the situation and lose control of their share of the market.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who ultimately come to the management of companies, and people who make products are pushed out of the decision-making area.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is pushed away by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, he could be a Microsoft in the '90s...
They've been defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
"A great idea from a great product separates a great deal of artificial labor ... when you twist the big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to make -- some things you can't make you do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts - connecting them all together...
Ultimately, it all comes down to taste -- it's all about trying to express yourself in the best way that people have ever done, and then trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal big ideas.
Part of what made the famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology specialists in the world.
Without information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the Health Act while the court is handling the case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial issue, whether he would listen to the exclusion of President Obama's health law, two of his judges, Antonina Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were behind a lunch sponsored legal firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was a request supported by 26 states that challenged the rapid review of health by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists throughout the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the trial; in fact, a five- 1/2-hour rotating debate is expected in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be in the midst of a court decision.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Act should be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clementa’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federation of Federalists, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another firm sponsoring lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the campaign.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the trial meeting.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, leader of the Republicans in the Senate and known opponent of the Health Act, was present.
Honorable guests at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federation of Federalists for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they had obeyed, they might have fallen under Principle 4C of the Code, which reads: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honored guest or be mentioned in the programme of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with great financial interests, was sufficient to signal ethical activists in the Government.
“This stunning violation of ethics and indifference to the code is contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges”, said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges drank and had dinner at an official fund-raiser with lawyers whose cases are now being tried in court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with the federalist society in the cases.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not for Scully and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Obama administration when the first court objections to the law were filed at the level of the first court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan waive the hearing in this case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion-dollar plane order
The Emirates Air Force orders 50 wide-band Boeing 777 liners and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boying Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal - over $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But it's an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft, and the preliminary price for all of these 50 planes is $18 billion.
Just as important is the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold dwellings of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on these weekends its largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft, 50 two-pass Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total pre-screened price to $26 billion, Boeing said in 2011 at Aviashou Dubai.
Later Monday, said Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which may boast of a much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The preliminary price for six aircraft will be over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neil Dior.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have money to pay for airplanes, but they also have an increase in fuel prices, which is usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the largest costs, not so much because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of the aircraft when the prices rise, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates Order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from reaching out to its domination with its A350 aircraft.
The Boeing victory on the plane took place four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which rivals exactly 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after buyers demanded to increase the load and the range of flight.
The Boeing Co stock has grown by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister apparently lost her election in Michoakane
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped the opposition Fausto Vallejo of the IPR in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not appear to have applied for the post of Governor Michoacán during the bitter public elections, and she stated on Monday that the traffickers had helped to push the race towards one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the Western State Governorate race is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
“The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is disturbing, not only for Michoakan but also for the whole country”, said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the following day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our electoral workers... they took the urns to vote, they put obstacles... and they made people vote" in favour of the IPA.
The IPR ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She's preparing a return, and winning Michoakan is an important step in this attempt.
The IP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valejo seems to have only slightly overtaken Calderon, who headed the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, to which the Governor ' s chair now belongs, came the third major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoakana, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines were long dominated.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election when he advocated for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race for fear.
For the IPR, however terrible the election in Michoakana would be, the victory would be a driving impulse for the party.
The man who should represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nyeto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting in the coming year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has pledged India and China to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB Office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing major economies must “do all they can” to speed up the restoration of the currency block through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe ' s difficulties “free” and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"It's up to all of us."
“Anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he said in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asian may be protected to some extent, but she cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy ' s loans have grown threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it can bring the world economy back to recession, and has led to the calls of the leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided great strength in the negotiations to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not an option, this is a prerequisite, because where we will find work for tens of millions of our young men and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to provide political assistance to Europe for 1.2 billion people in India, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will know that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to the holidays to the sea, and this will not be understood well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to hold Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, lost enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB ' s forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “decreasing risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from falling and significant capital flows from their economies.
The Pentagon ' s terrible warnings of potential cuts in defence spending
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, stepped up the situation Monday at the Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and would cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already familiar with a reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but now it fears that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if the congress is unable to reach an agreement on expenditures.
“The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry”, said Panette in a letter to the senators of the republican John McCain, Arizona, and the republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to adopt an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called secester had led to a 23 per cent overall reduction and the end of many new projects.
“This severe reduction, which has been so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible — you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building — and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize it,” wrote Panetta to the senators.
“We will also have to fire many of our state employees, and since the reduction will be done so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the state to achieve the goal.”
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious damage to their readiness."
The reductions will eventually affect the troops, Panetta said.
“Although military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the Sequestre, military achievements will be seriously affected by the major budget disruption”, Panetta warned.
“Contract staff will be reduced, ending in the cancellation of contracts and a military-supported oversight contract.”
“The staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The consequences of the Sequestery at the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power.”
“We stand firm against these draconian actions”, the senators reported in a joint statement Monday evening when they issued Panetta's letter.
"That's not the way we can live with, and that's not the way we have to impose."
“The Sequestre is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta's letter or the senator's recent warnings will lead to a budget compromise or strengthen calls for the Pentagon's release from cuts, we will see later.
Panetta was completely sincere about possible reductions, although he had come to work in the Pentagon's leadership after many years of conducting budget assessments in Congress and the White House and aware that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a dreary picture of what might happen next -- an army with a shell, but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free squad."
"This is the wing of the plane without enough trained pilots."
“This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission”, Panetta said in his opening remarks in the Pentagon.
"This is a force that suffers from an unstable combat spirit, a poor readiness and unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he gave new details on how the reductions “proceed significant operational risks: slowing down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restricting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond to anywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face obstacles, including those already tested, and some only at early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the Army and the Marine Corps need to replace the hammer.
The cessation of further development and testing of F35 may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch Lies
A glimpse of recent headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
Presidential candidate Herman Kane is involved in challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
The Pennsylvania University administration was charged with false testimony because they allegedly hid the retired football coach from raping boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The bed destroys careers and shocks countries.
Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself, denying his findings, which was quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign involving the concealment of extramarital relations.
Again, none of the living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was found lying about his sexual relations with Monica Levinsky during his second term in office.
History of fraud in school and college exams is an ordinary case.
There have been cases where teachers have responded to the tests in order to have a good evaluation of the results of their activities.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you may be lied to 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study revealed that strangers had lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
The detection of a lie or the detection of a lie is essential to everyone for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game similar to, say, charades, where you have to call "Accepted!", the detection of lies is a serious knowledge-based knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of lies have been divorcised.
Liars look in the eyes.
They do not always stop, stutter, blush, or become vain.
We should not conclude that it is difficult to detect liars and that it is difficult to expose them.
An experienced liar can come to the truth by observing the structure of allegations, mimicry, the structure of questions and the temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of false knowledge, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviewing, negotiation or management.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel comfortable, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others feel about them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people cheat less on their partners than on their singles (but the lie they tell is often the most urgent).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your facility.
It's called "the definition of the baseline state."
This helps to provide a starting point for the assessment of developments further.
Keep an eye on the pose, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person keeps knocking at his feet in a normal state, then you will not make unjust accusations when you see a knock on his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Deceptors can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can place their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their position in a certain way, or demonstrate “comfort after interview” -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position when all complex issues are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end of an interrogation signal to simply look at this relief after an interview.
So note the speech of your object.
Scott Peterson is known to have caved in and used his past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search all over the country.
Primitive people can also use distance in saying, "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely caught.
Someone can use the "qualified language" when they answer the complex question, "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect lies, but the ability to detect deception can be mastered.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not being victimized by skilled rogues in professional and personal life.
The dispute plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be revised following the threat of the United States of America to postpone its approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- calling for the anger of trade unions, but after calming environmentalists -- the oil pipeline company claims that it would be willing to revise the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that she would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still be approved.
The company broadcast this decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be approved for oil pipelines, although with another route.
This is following a statement made by the Department of State last week that it will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it examines new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sands and the Ogalala aquafer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental analysis commissioned by the Department of State is likely to dissuade the decision until 2013, following the elections next year, although the authorities denied that policy was involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call from the Department of State and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He must transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil-race plants in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but they love trade unions that hope for approximately 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska who oppose the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and the Ogalala Aquafer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the Department of State on environmental impact showed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy source stated that the Department ' s auditor had commissioned a separate review of the procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign, is a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another is whether the choice of the firm that was hired for the initial study was inappropriate, since it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was brought to court for allegedly causing a child's nausea from fear.
The New York family claims that Patty LaBell's disco diva started pushing their home in Manhattan's lobby, scaring their underage daughter to the point of fear.
Lady Marmalade's tirade intimidated the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she endured “change of personality, sleep disorder” and “strong fear of strangers”, says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk came down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard carrying their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes" and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell made an angry excuse to a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came into rage and began to use mockery -- a word for C and a word for F -- in elevated tone ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle at me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her companion had to hold her back and shove her in the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she was exhausted, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell an apology note, but no response was received.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBell do not respond to the comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family was planning to sacrifice whatever money he would receive for charity to children with cancer.
"The goal is to get Patty LaBell to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems slowed down the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario López in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign funding declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 - the year that will be included in Sinaloa ' s economic history as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Not only did the low temperatures of February lead to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the potential for growth in the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by ice cream provided by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, 78.03 per cent of which were completely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and nut being the main crops affected.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters of the country, an accelerated increase in unemployment rates, from January to March 55.053 in Sinaloa were unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, from the second quarter to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a percentage that is more than 74,000 in the population of Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 compared to the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa is shared by many factors throughout the year, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market, with a view to limiting the resources imposed by the law adopted by Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is not easy for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Suspension of immigration
López Cervantes said that there was also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people leaving the state in search of jobs abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily due to difficulties with entry, and in the second, because once they enter, they are already faced with very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remain and require jobs here in the state, resulting in an increase in unemployment”, he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market of Sinaloa is worse given the large number of labour-related violations reported by INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the state is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularity, another reminder of work in the state is presented with low salaries; in the state the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos by September.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to data from the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July, which shows a decline of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly came to the service companies.
Long
Against the background of the economic downturn, the State Government requested a three billion pesos loan approval at the state congress in July, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level only 2,600 million pesos were approved, and by November no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes demonstrates the lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Processing, said that during 2011, the wishes of various sectors, including the State Government itself, had not been agreed upon.
“The economic efficiency in Sinaloa has been really low this year, there is much to do to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have not been able to reconcile the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said that events such as early frosts this year had halted the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low size of the economy is the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not becoming fast enough to create economic dynamics, which allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, consequently, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations”, he said.
Revision of the route
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme needs to be developed that will re-establish the direction and economic course of the state, and that all the material and human resources available to Sinaloa must be mobilized," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme”, he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy direction.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is starting to get involved in the work and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day income fine, the sentence was handed down to the Navolato citizen for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of an offence against health, in this case the possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol on the street of Cypruso Valdes, before post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white truck, carrying a black bag in the car, and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the removal was brought to the attention of the Second District Court and the accused continues to be imprisoned at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions should be made to the work
Public works related to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining unfinished or long delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while work programmes had been under way, they were at risk, as the State Government was unable to make contributions that amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest nearly 12 million, and although the year ends, they didn't give us a penny when they had to give us a piece from the beginning of July," he said, "so we don't delay, we started work and they moved very far, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not made the contributions it was required to make, so at the beginning of the time of the municipal administration, it had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been provided by the State administration.
“This has happened to us in the previous administration, because the state did not have financial opportunities to participate, but the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what is left to the state”, he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that interest related to them would come as quickly as possible.
"They have to make almost 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us a penny."
The Court will approve the digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals to digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (CC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transposes the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not collected for its annulment.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to speak on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and remain in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law established by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Coffetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Marguerite Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
Under this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and to support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the project ' s arguments that the federal executive could not determine the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the State administration.
“I also do not believe that if this had happened, this would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulatory body”, and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, was relevant to the federal executive, which had a constitutional mandate, State administration.
Replacing analogue signals to digital signals - one of the most important changes in recent years - has resulted in better use of radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of turning into a digital form that includes meeting public needs, which not only has a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “require the work of the entire system of State economic governance, which includes a group of authorities which the Constitution unites into the State executive power”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the assistance of the executive, despite the existence of narrow technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of the Congress, ensures compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere, he said.
In Michoakana, they're analyzing the possibility of counting "vote after voice"
According to the data provided in the ERP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governorial Elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6,074 Protocols.
The possibility of counting the “vote by vote” is real in the election process in Michoakana this year, where, according to the preliminary results of the election programme (APR), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6.074 minutes.
In light of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections, Michoakana (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lánderal Saragosa, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the constituency approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It is recalled that Michoakan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date of entry into force of the electoral process and that the Governor of Leonel Goda Rangel did not include its publication within the time limits set out in the law in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CJ) ruled on the constitutional claim put forward by the local legislative assembly and called the “ineffective and illegal” vote of the State representative on constitutional reform because he has no right to “authorize or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of “vote after vote”, Maria de Los Angeles Länderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles, it would be possible for the General Council of IVM to submit a partial or full vote count to the local electoral authority.
For example, partial recalculation of one or more electoral urns may be made on condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no vote and counting of the documents in the urn or is not in the chair ' s possession; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the total recalculation in all the ballots in the elections may take place when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the elections under consideration and those who won the second ballot is less than or equal to one percentage, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that put forward the second of the candidates.
The total recalculation will also be made if, at the end of the normal calculation, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken second place in the event that the electoral urns that have been taken into account on the partial recalculation are deleted.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to ERW, the difference between the first and the second places is only 0.16 per cent, not including 129 votes in the total number of 923 minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown at night on Sunday; on Monday a survey and a restful mass was conducted.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to be scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname.
After receiving condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortésa family returned to the capital of Koawila on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attending the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the colonel’s ashes arrived at the hourstand on the Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school peers and football team, who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, he always told his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister, reported.
In her opinion, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to go to the Air Force College in Sappana, Halisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he had a head around in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man "as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him as he did when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sappana to attend the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most: flying a plane.
He's being escorted one last time.
Shots fired at Lieutenant Colonel Cortés Bassio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and made progress both in his studies and in sports, held him last.
Bassio Cortés died recently when the helicopter under his control was crushed, along with the Secretary of the Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake Moro, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martinez, to a training school, where his family was waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies were found dumped on the NL Kaedreit farm.
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities had shown eleven people in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kaedreit Jimenes, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was discovered on the 1.5 km road of Kaedreit towards Santiago, at the height of a commune known as El Castillo.
A few who passed by noticed that the gates were open in a village house decorated with beige and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and there was another man next to him in a white shirt.
There was practically another person's body in one metre, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no casings.
There are signs on the outskirts of the village house addressed to one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullet holes in the gates as well.
11 captured in Kadereit
The Ministry of National Security has represented 11 persons, including minors, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kaedreit and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, fraud and secret graves.
According to published information, on 11 November, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone calling to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event occurred on 12 November at 0600 hours in the morning, military personnel patrolling the village of Old Rancho in Kaedreite when they saw a car without registrations with two men in the living room.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a patrolman, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on public land by La Pravda, who, when he saw the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of being buried in secret in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hin and Kaedreit.
New Italian Government to be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that has put the country at the brink of an economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the brink of an economic disaster and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A presidential statement stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period,” said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he had been able to form a government, but a tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"Structure is now well spelled out," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less common, since Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level
The administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner Monty, should approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets have set Italy's BTP bond income by 10 years more than 7 per cent, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty: “We said we would actively support this Government.”
We believe that it is the Government's last chance to get Italy out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the Silvio Berlusconi LDP party, which was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty should lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats that Monty is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blockade or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure could become a disaster.
Monty began consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief recess at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy's debts now reached a critical level amid the uncertainty that the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that policies would only give him time to reform before new elections were scheduled.
Monty said that he wished to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only of technical experts, an indication of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties made it more difficult to include political figures.
The Spanish have more game experience than Tikos do
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
Only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games on Costa Rica.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, compared to 22 players brought by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a full list of class A games, Tricolor has only Michael Umana's defender as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
The Spanish football players who played in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the Premier League of England were very active in the league and in the local Cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish Fury should be added to the complex qualifications in the Euro or World Cup.
The players of Tikos, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONKACAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list in the Spanish compulsive Golkiper Iker Cassillas, who, last Sunday, against England (the match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of the ex-galliper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Cassillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernández, Barcelona's player, 106 matches.
Cassillas and Javi were recognized as the best in the past week by UEFA, along with another Iberian team player, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and a Shalk Raul González bomber with 102.
Almost a hundred Charles Puyol with 97 games coming up.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa with Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iñesta with 62, Sesk Fabregas with 61, and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica near Michael Umana, the left side of Junior Diaz with 48 matches and the Brian Ruiz bomber with 45.
Next, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Kaylor Navas of 31, Randall Asofefe of 32, Michael Barrantes of 31, Carlos Hernández of 36 and José Luis Lopez of 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain in Gerard Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santa Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morale has only four, and Hordi Alba has two, only one in Costa Rica has Victor Bolivar, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain’s leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as many as Carlos Hernández and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the group said it was ready to give one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group said it was also a dream for them, a dream that had become a reality, to play in that country.
This was a claim by bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is on South America's territory as part of a tour of 20 years of work and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group called Las Robertas.
It's a piece of conversation that's fully deciphered online at The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some commitment to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, see it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope this has brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, and it's great surfing places, that's how we know about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you've made a spectacular show with lots of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to make the best show of all kinds of songs possible; we're going to try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting for people.
That's a 20-year tour of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we had been doing this for more than 20 years made it like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
For us, things are going very well.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the growth of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large groups.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows up from a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears, but it is far more strange when five or ten groups appear in one city at a time.
We are proud to be part of a Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of Seattle's sound.
It's also very strange that your group has stayed together for such a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cemeron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends, and thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything couldn't have been better.
Your attitude toward the word “glory ” was difficult; but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We make sure we don't spend too much time on the tour because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it's done, not deciding to be famous and be a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and it was great at first.
We've been a group for almost three years, and we haven't released any albums until Andy ( Andrew Woods) died.
It was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about the amazing person that Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local Las Robertas group will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that we liked more than anyone else, so we can't wait to see that Las Robertas can offer a live one, and that must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he's using the first thing in his head.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Gezer Butler, John Entwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the branch, even though it is no longer fashionable?
I think we're all feeling a little bit of a rip off from the word "grange."
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone who came up at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are now making music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and those songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this to me.
So, I think you can be a happy person, and yet you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, and his family doctor told him to examine the loss of muscle strength in his legs.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which caused him to be operated four times and monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told television channel N that Fuhimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of force in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that he believed that Fuhimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He transferred four surgeries to the cancer of the tongue, lost 18 kilograms of weight, adding other diseases, such as severe erosion gastritis, gastric cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and problems with leg circulation, the doctor listed.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army's destruction squad, which operated secretly in the first years of his reign.
Muhika is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by President José Muhika of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, next Wednesday, as the most important item in the broad agenda for meetings with political, commercial and Uruguayan authorities, as set out in the schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara would be “a welcome exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, according to the leadership of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Muhika seeks support from Calderon for Uruguay in the incident with France, which occurred when French President Nikola Sarkozy included the South American country in a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canna.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remained tax havens from the international community, a statement that had sparked Uruguay ' s protest and a call for consultations by its ambassador to a European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group established from the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January of this year on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave this “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased trade between the two countries.
The sutured plumber will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Dude from the evil paws of Bower, but he's never done it in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he's going to fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication that will appear in stores around the world this month was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using points.
“Mario is a hero who has to report on how stereoscopy without points will work,” said Nintendo, head of press service in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially developed under this platform" because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a “accessible” video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and mobile game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part “simple” to attract less experienced users.
Once in a while, most experts will go "on the second round" to levels that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or "only influences the depth of action, but on which three dimensions must be played to overcome the various obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the show and repeats the successful formula from previous games, and the plumber with the ears has to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Kolom said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo had begun to answer in the United States for a $70 million money-laundering plot.
That was the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that demanded the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At the press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the court of first instance had already signed extradition.
He argued that during his mandate he had not “attended his hands” to legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Rouano Marrokin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (COP), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the expense of Q120 million at the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove’s social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added to this.
The anniversary gave rise to the outcome of the ceremony held at the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove appeared near Trinity Velya in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions, which have cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
A different political vision during the elections showed the same nature of Trinijove ' s work.
After the President of the General Assembly, Arthur Masa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, an ex-consul of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and ex-Lieutenant Mayor and current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal council of Richard Goma, attended the ceremony.
The current social welfare and family consultant, Josép Lewis Clarice and CEO of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa, also appeared in Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinijove had appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far was “a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the hope of people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and work done to it”, he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the Balmes Street building, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in House 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday afternoon voluntarily the building that they illegally occupied and where they organized mass gatherings that irritated neighbors, as decided by the court without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be checkpoints," said the manager.
The squatters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the population, took all the electricity and water, painted the walls and left traces of different kinds, especially the banks under alcohol.
The first three floors were for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income has decreased by 80 per cent.
Club owner says the building's captors dragged her into an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to answer the neighbors ' complaints about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the club's visitors, but by the people of the highlands and, above all, by those who attended the parties they had organized, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors had said.
The club owner said the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner, and for nine months now, he's been "forgiveing" her the rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
PP municipal group President Alberto Fernand Díaz demanded last week “to evacuate the building immediately to resolve the problems of coexistence and the common spirit of neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before summer, but in the past few months, squatters had invaded all the floors and virtually every room and that some had broken into.
In this sense, he added that “the end of impunity must be put to rest and the resistance to the culture of the building.”
So yesterday, police officers evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police left for Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
The architects agree with the possibility of a competition after a dispute over contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed debate on the role of Kolcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinguished Capital Corporation of Barcelona (BSC), the administration printed promotional papers for Kolcerola.
The tract described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona’s capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SKB, in 1987 the park once again took a place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are not heading north-south, but up (mountain) - downstream (sea).
The position of Kolcerola as a natural park is contrary to that idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabana as Yoga Bear.
This was so until, in September, the Council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Kolserol.
Under the gates, the idea of a park is no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, is it colcerola or a park or a mountain?
The competitions and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of the chosen people’s clan know each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to just one of the few coincidences between what three architects of Barcelona say and scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it is necessary to discuss the “front of the mountain” when the offer of Ildephon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"We have to assume that Barcelona's largest park is a beach.
Among other things, thanks to his excellent availability.
Kolcerola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title “the Kolcerola Gate” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we should act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the proposal “an intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainity of public space forecasting” following the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum’s “Single Swan”.
The first fear is actually a limit to where you can build.
“The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step” is meant for transitions.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because current [with regard to the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble.”
More to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolcerola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo recalls that there is work already done outside Kalserola, which “should not be missed by the ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join the project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is something that should lead the interdisciplinary teams (“success”, he claims,” which should have been created: “The architects should be only an instrument”.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that sets out the title of this part is complex because the competition rules lack the general form of Kolcerola: “16 cross-matching competitions have been announced,” he says, in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longer reading here to see and understand the area as a whole.”
This will, at least in his case, lead to the decision to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can be crossed by programme and definition with a project of an architect for the neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the Council will ensure that the lane directly over Rhonda de Dalt must provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judge of Red Casino forgave the mayor of Monterrey's brother in the trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the lawful representative of Red Casino has granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which conducts a lawsuit against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution so that the Monterrey authorities could authorize a secret operation in a gambling house.
After a public conviction, the Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days, following the requirements of the Second Prohibition of Movement Order after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaedreit for allegedly extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with a medium degree of imprisonment because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in a municipal prison in San Nicolas, Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Janez, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, it was clear enough to prove Jonas' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legitimate representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardons for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that in the following hours he could be freed.
During the trial, the public prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners in the gambling house was pardoning, although the lawyer tried not to give a name.
Based on records 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements could then be made regarding the process planned against him; nor would any reparation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrassabal Breton immediately.
A court official, Jorge Janez, went to the San Nicolas prison in Garza to tell Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Perez Hakome describes the details of the disaster where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained on an accident involving the death of Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in full integrity without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the ship has had several contact with the ground, the wings have come into contact with the trees in 25 meters, where the device has lost the icing."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the area of impact did not indicate any parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact is structurally intact.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements of passenger transport.
The earth in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
To date, the Secretary said, the main thing was to get results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
However, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack the Presidential helicopter was operating at a cruise speed and that this had occurred on a mildly rising ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hacomé listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visual flight rules, which means that the command must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for take-off when an aircraft headed for the border between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a smaller area and greater visibility in the Kuernavac Valley.
The place is hitting.
The impact coordinates and the latest records from the radar of the aircraft are likely to match before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction.
Dispersion of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The sprawling of debris suggests that the helicopter has encountered land in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, there remains evidence of sudden shipwrecks, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that there may have been multiple contact with the land.
While working on the ground, pieces of aircraft were found at 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The picture shows the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in a larger territory than the designated area near the crash site, scattered parts of the aircraft were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces gene demand obesity
Social protection is led by a study on the finding of obesity genes for children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Protection Institute (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect the obesity gene of children and young people, which had been named the “Registration Genetics in Children and Adolescents” protocol, which would provide a calculation of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Department of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
This team is assisted by specialists and postgraduates from the National Institute of National Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute of Technology (NPI).
In the study, the population (ordered or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where children will be tested every Saturday at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun at the Kuautemoka Sports Centre in the west of Mexico City, and since 8 October the events had been held at the sports centre in Nosaualkootl (East of Mexico City).
Once the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue in the sports centre of Independence (South Mexico) and finally in the sports centre of Morelos (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to obesity development and to identify a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal will be to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with parental permission and under their supervision to complete individual food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that result in diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and coverage of waist), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to detect genes associated with childhood obesity) would be carried out on Saturday.
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concerns of health professionals about the alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only 6 years of growth occurred: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent girls were obese, and there was a significant increase in weight,” said MSSI specialist.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country differed from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 per cent of the American Indian offspring, 30 per cent of the Europeans and 5 per cent of the Africans, and this condition affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly the result of obesity genetics is the failure of the body to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and it is delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit for participants, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even he said that the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and the forearms means the possibility of a metabolic or even prediabetes disorder.
The information is treated in all confidentiality, and the doctor is given in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in the way of life that must be taken in order to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there were three main causes that caused excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of TV and using small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition as analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a UNAM chemical researcher, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If road coverage signals were to be given attention, there would be a need to repair some 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the capital area in Mexico Valley, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a UNAM chemical researcher, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalted road surfaces were correct, the number of holes could be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the Technology View of Pits, read in the International Year of Chemistry, reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore to counter the education of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbons molecules, some high molecular mass, called asphalt, and others low molecular mass called mortars, which together give road cover its characteristic binding behavior.
The related behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures it behaves as a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that street asphalt resistance is not constant but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineering specialist.
The hymphaca scientist observed that the streets of Mexico City were largely covered with a flexible coating consisting of six layers of material, three of which included bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen composed of small stones, dropped into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that's made up of this coating, he said, is stuffed in bitumen.
When driving and exerting effort, this helps the forces to be very well distributed by road.
If it were modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coating, he added, placed the last layer, which is called a layer of wear, made of a small stone, which is actually sand, which is also sunk into the asphalt.
Since it will be a layer that will contact the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt coating and road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires adequate thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water penetrates and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes all layers of the coating to be softened and therefore the formation of the pits.
During the formation of the pits, he said that the first layer of wear was applied and only then did it affect the bitumen, but the damage did not occur immediately, which should be addressed at the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that the transport load was another important factor in the education of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer must always be linked to the transport load and must be guaranteed to meet this requirement in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of holes.
Rafael Herrera said that there was still much to be done about bitumen, for example, by bituminous emulsions that were already on the market in other countries and even help to make pits with ease and without high temperatures.
What did Valé's candidate lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Meline Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle received the title of Princess 14 times.
The next time, Vale del Cauca was left to seek the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna was to be pleased to be caught on the podium of winners with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her new Princess of Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and the Skipper, the department has 14 princesses, and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the Crown, but were declared princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonzuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hysée Alhure Garceses (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Alhuré (2008).
The question that many are now asking:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches has shown that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not only was she chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version, the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?”
She replied to the person asking:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood, the Little Prince, is a pretty profound book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemirowski, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Fire of Blood.
An answer that the jury did not like because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books described it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "the universe's wisdom is what must happen."
And all of you, please read a little bit, "Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypnotics, Valje was burned by favoritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, since she had been preferred, she had been met with an ovation, and she was a candidate who had received all the preliminary awards (the Ostera culinary competition, the best national costume, and the Queen-Mother), “which aroused the zeal of other candidates, provoked stress on the Queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage”.
And this was noted during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during two of her demonstrations at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was evident that she lacked the strength and energy shown by Magdalene and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the Home Program on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become queen"
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided the press and this has been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election, Lucy Doti, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the outside but also at the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also assumed that the representative of Valle was wrong about berries and fibrosis, which was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
King Jorge Hernán Orosco notes that Melina had no better body, which was better, "but the problems of ventricular fibrosis, which were not very noticeable to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was surgically involved.
"Operations are good, but Valier doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the brutal prediction came true last night, it is said that it was the child that Raymondo gave Melin as compensation for her lack of pleasure in receiving the crown.
Whether this is the case or not, the fact that Melina is now starting a year of rule, not as queen, but as princess, is a position that allows her to represent Colombia at an international competition designated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will come into history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in receiving the crown.
That was the work of a man who recognized Alfonso Kano's body.
A criminal from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI criminalist Kali came into history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Commander Alfonso Cano in comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working in CTI, it was the turn of the week to “on-call” Elizar González, a man from Puerto Techad who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to walk through the jungle for more than five days to reach the location where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valé, where he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. ladens and walls.
During the week of the Elysar identification operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days of clothing.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from the Caucasus to Palmyra.
He knew that he would need to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who was leading the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research group at the location of the body, he did not identify it in its appearance; it was very different from what the media showed.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, with no glasses, and much worse.
But the prints don't go wrong.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elisar compared the body’s fingerprints to those in the pictures.
His eyes didn't let him down: it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Techad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the FARC
Search for fingerprints
For a dactiloscopy specialist, the Sijin branch of Kali has received a confession from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizor González at a press conference on the operation against Cano, particularly significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, dactyloscopy specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and establish the identity of the detainees.
In detention, many criminals have forged certificates or have no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them at the base.
The researcher said that in case of theft, he had to take a piece of the wall home because the thief was holding hands in this place to control the safe, full of gems and money.
"With the walls hard to work because they are not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire system and identify the perpetrator who participated in several robberies," he said.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation found that a relative could have been suspected of the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a killer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A CTI specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent was applied to places where fingerprints were available.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Following this, fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or are entered into the register.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI programme.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all the things you touch leave fingerprints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
"Angered people" challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke up a camp outside Zukotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the area and went to the park next door.
On Tuesday, members of the Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York when they tried to re-enter the Manhattan area under a court order, where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zucotti Square, where they wanted to go because of a court order that allowed the angry people to tear down the camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the riot by taking over the park in the north of the city where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to break up the camp in the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the “enraged people” to the evacuation of the tent town, which was ordered personally by the mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg, had been brought to court by Judge Lucy Billings to issue a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the “enraged people” have begun to seize a new park located at the site of the merger of the central streets of Channel Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the arrival of the Church of Troika.
At least for the time being, they could occupy the place, but then the police came and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The Organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents at the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to members of the movement by trying to mediate negotiations with the police.
However, the area of Zukotti, which is private property, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for Tuesday, which will address the legality of this morning's protestors' rally.
Some of the protestors who went there carried and distributed copies of that order at the same time and even gave copies to the police guarding the area, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who said that some policemen had been protestors.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and from forcing the enforcement of “the laws that were issued after the start of the seizure, or from banning demonstrators from regaining access to the park with shops and other property previously used”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws did not allow them to reopen tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protestors from Zucotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was taken because the protestors “broken the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the area to be cleaned because it had become “a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm others” because “some enterprises had been threatened” and the neighbours feared “a deterioration in the quality of life”.
The evacuation that took place this morning was repulsive and shows that in the heart of Bloomberg there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added a representative of the movement, who condemns the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for the Wall Street Seizure also indicated that they intended to organize “ grand events” on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to recall the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is going to be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show.
Along with Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear in the Russell Peters TV programme on 1 December.
Canada's Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in Greater Repair, a lifeguard in Malibu Saviors, Bunny in Playboy, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the kroner (actor) Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, will appear in the Russell Peters TV programme on December 1st, as a very special Maria.
Today, CTV presented footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely distributed home pornographic video on the Internet, where she appears along with her husband, the drummer of the "Mötley Crüe" band Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in the manger depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, the famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who has recently been the lead on My Cruel Torpedo of Truth, Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special CTV Christmas show is attended by Canadian singer Bubble, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March on the Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato and who also knows the sound of scandals.
Recently, Bubble called a "bitch" by American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York
Japan Born After the Earthquake
GDP rose 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has led to the nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Party has experienced since the Second World War
According to the Government of Tokyo, the loss amounted to $300,000, a blow that seems to be taking place despite the plight of the world.
After three lost blocks, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent per year.
The financial year for the Japanese, registered in the second quarter, starts in March 2012, also reflects the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
Rebirth may be partly due to the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs, which occurred from January to March, the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the use of a crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan was awakened mainly by the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This rate has increased by 1% with increased costs for cars, travel and rest.
Glemmo yen
Tokyo provided an internal market when yen - a Japanese currency - became one of the foreign exchange havens selected by investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the United States, a privilege that pushes, like a stone, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, are blamed for their low rates from July to September.
As markets continue the siege of peripheral EU countries, the Government of Eshihiko Noda does not lower its vigilance.
We must be careful of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of yen, said Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of participating countries had shown clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts a break in the world economy, has shown that core forces are slowing down.
He then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it fell by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Gives Soil to Doubt
Papademos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written obligation
With the periphery premiums for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander along the labyrinth leading to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new transitional Government of Ellada is more imposed on Brussels than on the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for the new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of the Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, Papademos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will culminate tomorrow in the vote of confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public officials and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, the message of Samaras leaves no doubt about his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the conservatives made more than one step in his attitude towards the EU and IMF, organizations that should defrost the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of acceptance of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still indignant about the effect caused by the allegations of the Papandreou referendum in all or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume aid unless the new Government and the leaders of the major parties of Greece sign a “written agreement without ambiguities and as soon as possible”.
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that troika inspectors could return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new Government “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
There's enough thread in the Greek ball for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's “core” position with regard to this type of finance
Spain “has become a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that, in the last two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of cooperation instruments whose “substantial nature” she said was that it is “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the better future of all mankind based on faith in people”.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyadolíd with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “excellently necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with a view to halving the number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded”.
Spain is “still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and assumes this task with all “responsibility”, says Princess Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “provide the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, “the main recipients of these loans”.
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we're facing."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a dispute area but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and 100 million of those households would be able to escape from the poverty they were in.
The impulse to establish a microcredit system in Spain and in the rest of the world “walked along the road begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus emphasized that Ms. Sofia was “a act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as “a stunning idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was later adopted by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continued development everywhere”, Her Majesty said, whose connection to the project was yesterday the title “Heads of the Family” collected in Valyadolida by the “Banker of the Poor”.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her statement, calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative."
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenes said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the times of the economic boom, since it was a “permanent commitment”.
Jimenes concluded that microcredit entails a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty”, and now “more than ever” developed Governments should work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to costs.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the “success” in giving “reliability” to the people “covered by all doors closed” and the Mayor of Valyadolida Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city “opening his doors covered by the spirit of solidarity”.
The VAT proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HDS) in Leipzig on Monday 14 November passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe has not been originally planned in the programme, but it has arisen in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the Government's policy is far from as strict as it should be today as Greece and perhaps tomorrow as Italy. ...
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, tabled by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The ovations stood for a few minutes, which deserved Angel Merkel's statements and several hours later Wolfgang Schöible, the Europhiel and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The basic idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in a slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
It's time for the chancellor to break into Europe.
This may mean changes in the Treaty of Lisbon that make it possible to strengthen the control of the European Union over the financial policies of the euro area countries, but this may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote “to give Europe a person”.
In any event, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schöble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this decision; Britain opposes it, and the leaders of the CD believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each member country of the European Union in the management of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would have markedly increased the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kol, but she did not seek to influence the congress through “small” European countries or countries in difficult situations that liked to criticize “high-sized” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted the whole paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is cheating on hospital leaves?
After the cash benefits, the UMP and the Government began to enter the hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and to address this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating fraud in social benefits.
And in order to help this attack, which has arisen from the desire to save lives in a difficult situation, but also as part of the campaign of the right to re-election to the Presidents, most want to focus on hospital lists.
First of all, in terms of budget savings, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave before the beginning of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer's consent, a sick worker will lose a salary of at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income in four days.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which Les Echos said would save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, imposing on public servants one day without the payment of sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for the benefit, unlike the three-day expectation of private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority also raises the subject of fraud again, with regard to abuse in issuing hospital bills.
Control will become tougher and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to pay back all the illegal payments you received," Xavier Bertrand warned on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital leaves.
Indeed, they have been subject to constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002.
People in France are no more in pain than they are anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the numbers on the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3,000 million, representing 5% of total health expenditure.
Of that amount, 46 per cent were maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54 per cent were sickness benefits, amounting to Euro6.2 million.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said that they had not taken a single day of hospital care.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010 37 per cent of the hospital population lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
Comparing these figures with those of European neighbours, it is evident that French workers are no more inclined to take a hospital than any other country ' s employees.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital-leaf fraud is very low compared to "serial" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic examination of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases audited, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term illness reports were “unjustified” or “too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically verified hospital sheets, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inconvenient or unfounded”, equivalent to 132,000 days.
In general, 169,000 cases were “unjustifiable” for several million hospital workers.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the number of "serial" jobs.
According to the MP, Dominic Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they account for between €9 million and €15 million of unreceivable budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said this, adding that 100 days provided by his coalition Government were not enough to carry out that task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme”, said the head of the Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “core task” of the new Government, as the country ' s presence in the Eurozone “is at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit of “up to 9%” from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Right Rejects Action by the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impeded the recovery of the economy.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary credit of Euro8,000 without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, said Antonio Samaras that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide must be legalized with foreign assistance, the Committee of Experts said
Canadians are denied death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, not counting cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code to permit suicide with foreign assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture where people are afraid to argue on the subject of death”.
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Canadian Society report.
And 68.6 percent of them end up dead in a hospital.
The country ' s highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report have come to a conclusion that is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is abusing the use of euthanasia or suicide with foreign assistance to people who cannot or do not wish to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report at the teleconference, confirmed that most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance had not been legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, they believe that this will help people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66 per cent believe that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of less value.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that the legally lawful cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of health care at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some health-related legislation experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described as “the extreme” the position of the experts who signed the report, since, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to fatalities.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask for assistance in committing suicide, says Dechan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Meter Descham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that constituted the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called “a manifesto for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized with foreign assistance, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to surrender his power
Damascus condemns "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Siria Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria, Turkey and Jordan, favoured the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give up power in Syria, where about forty more civilians and members of the regime were killed.
"If Bashar had expensive interests, he would have resigned, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life," said the King of Jordan, next to Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their wishes will lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey is taking an increasingly strict course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enhancement of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime” followed by the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly strict course towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have died in the Derea area in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy machine guns in Jobara in the occupied city of Homs, according to the ONG.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was a “hazardous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, confident that this plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude the Syrian League of Arab States, it is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requiring 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, Journalists and Military Observers to enter the country.
French Foreign Minister Alan Jouppe also advocated sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into the “paranoia”.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of a plan to resolve the crisis adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of armed forces from the fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday, called the League of Arab States ' "improper" decision, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to come out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from the markets and the victims of the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, has asked markets for a little time to form their own team and implement a programme that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi regime.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not in parliament.
Monty spoke about the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for prime minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monty ' s presentation of a limited list of dozens or about that of the Heads of State of Georgia Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking for time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the sudden decline in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should have formed a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politics”.
The new Government will have to act until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence from Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that when he entered the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would become an important actor again in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, required, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marchegalla, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of the deficit".
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the household of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “change of the era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “other Italy”, according to the authors of the preconceptions.
The longevity of his team is unknown.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012, Italy must pay the sum of Euro200,000 in public debt.
Russian scientist aided Iran's nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, an American agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “potential military aspect” of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “since the 1960s, at the Soviet Military Nuclear Centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds. ”
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company producing nano-alms in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, IAEA refers to “clear indications that Iran’s development” of the nuclear detonator system “has been facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technology well, but who also informed the Agency that he had been working most of his career on this technology as part of his country’s military nuclear programme”.
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to an increase of 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
With the decline in 2009, it is a concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization stresses, “increasing violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, the organization adds in an official communication.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crimes, must be considered serious human rights violations,” added Paul Lejandre.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
Hate crimes in federal law are a legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes Facebook-like
On Monday, the Twitter microblog website changed its platform to allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they are watching, making the service look like Facebook.
The new "activities" tab and the other "name" allow you to follow more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", Internet users whose messages (twitters) you track, and those who follow yours.
This allows you to know if they publish messages if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested “at a small percentage of users in August” before reaching the internet wide on Monday, AFP told Twitter press secretary Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively unclear and as using rather vague terms (RT for overposting someone else's message, #foldfriday for recommending tracking other users), is largely a pleasure to experienced users, thus opening itself up to a wider audience, presenting to users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation through tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, obnoxious and excessively Facebook-like."
Functional activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the constitution of the “Golden Rule” of the budget
The leadership of a large coalition of social-democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget “gold rule” into the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible decline by the rating agencies of Austria ' s state credit rating (trip A).
Chancellor of Social Democrat Werner Faymann himself announced the decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, much higher than the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the national debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand euros more each year, presented a case by Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is therefore in compliance with the requirement of the summit of the eurozone member countries on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State or Government have demanded a reduction of the budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the “German model” because Germany was the first European country to adopt the “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the federal State budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP and land, as well as communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to make the public debt go below the 60 per cent mark established by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshihiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new foreign exchange interventions if the value of yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of yen, explained Mr. Noda Senatu.
On Tuesday, yen grew up almost to a historic mark, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold its yen for large-scale dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had set a new record of force since 1945.
But ever since then, Ian has grown constantly driven by the purchases of investors who view it as a “response” in these sad times of economic downturn around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic plank of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
Japanese currency growth is damaging to Japanese exports as Japanese products make Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into national currency.
“Japan is fighting to restore itself” after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), Mr. Noda stressed, who feared that the growth of yen would kill the fragile recovery.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed its growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic indicators of Japan”.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken yen.
But the Deputy Managing Officer of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to realize that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the broadcasting organization increased by 5,000 million yen (EUR 47,000) in the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 yen (EUR 519,000) ceilings for the purchase of various financial instruments to satisfy the securities market.
Eurozone
rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of debt crisis is undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, the rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further to the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended the bidding at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt dropped 0.4% and London dropped 0.1%.
Owing to the new difficulties of lending to euro area countries in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Settled investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down with a 0.7 per cent drop under the burden of new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its views on Europe, and the stock exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone is in a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, dropping 0.4 per cent.
According to brokers, it fell after the arrival of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of concern.
The return on Italian 10-year bonds on Tuesday reached 6.85 per cent and the return on Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity.
These difficulties, with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the stock exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened with paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the “core task” of his Government.
Spain was hit by markets before the Sunday parliamentary elections.
Between the interest rates on the 10-year debt commitments of Germany and Spain, a new historical maximum has been reached.
Expecting growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, owing to increased household consumption.
Insee nevertheless revised the figure of the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a reason for reflection on the share and location of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed are examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil and India are just a few of those who are strongly pursuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one installation to its kit after Fukushima, after the accident at Tri-Mile Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, it is contrary to this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, compounded by an increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a rise in carbon dioxide emissions from gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's turbine champion, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest carbon and gas consumer due to the break-up wind; therefore, carbon dioxide and electricity prices are 65% higher and 50% higher than average in Europe, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will illustrate the beautiful declarations of our country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole range of specialized international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineering will order the EPR to work for sixty years if its manufacturer is scheduled to close?
To solve the equation of energy, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as the Flemishville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are filled with the same obsession with security.
Over the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but no human or environmental implications.
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to combat such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy specialists wishing to build a reactor, stopping it in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to win leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
The best combination of energy sources for our country must be sought legally, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogma and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy at Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various parties - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, the subordinated policy of the figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of France as a “human rights State”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, who became newscasters when the Minister of the Interior (“Liberasion” of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and left in this regard are very agreeable.
On the right hand side, he was asked by Jacques Shirak, who in 1976 stated that “900 000 unemployed people will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers”, but by the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from around the world”.
The Difference in Generosity Only
In 2005, fear of invasion of the territory was felt by the Polish plumber, both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
There is only a difference in the level of generosity that they allow to be shown to immigrants.
In his programme, François Alland was limited to banality, saying that “co-operation will solve our immigration problem”.
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can be an electorative advantage, but it is costing very dearly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us of in a recent book on immigration (Special people: How migration has formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University publication, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restrictions on immigration reduce growth and reduce employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, causing wage cuts.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than replacing local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, but the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant workers has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Perry estimated that the increase of 1% of the migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This is without regard to the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the midst of the Nobel Prize winners of the United States, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, providing an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who has arrived at the age of 30 will make a net profit to the State budget (income minus expenditure) on an average of 150,000 euros in life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy was going to “teeth” into the missing points of growth.
These teeth, which were used to intimidate immigrants, had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be conceived
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century, it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulaga and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some felt that democracy could finally prevail over its enemies, vote and make it as direct as possible.
From the time of Napoleon the Little One knows that this is happening from the surface of thought.
General voting, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not sufficient and may even become a “repressive instrument”, as formerly said by the philosopher-Republican Etienne Vasro.
No, democracy requires much more -- public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodia of the true and false Greek referendum will have a dual exposure effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasantness of its impossibility and incoherence.
That duality must be considered to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized as appropriate and in a chaotic manner.
Cart Blanche for an absolute European monarch or foot jumps into the abyss of nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of a blade of guillotine, but of a joint, clear and continuous implementation of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and how many more will have to be listed because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is fully subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty of Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project under popular sovereignty must be restored urgently.
Because it is only by working together that Europeans can reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delore, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration of citizens is another madness and a new deadlock.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” the Republicans.
Revolutions of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe united at the economic level.
This can only be done through the establishment of a more democratic Europe at the political level, the true people ' s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Inconclusive chips are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villpent, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will result in an 11 per cent increase in world microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
The most important sector of non-contact technologies that allows public transport or purchases to be paid simply by keeping a map of the reading device.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chips will be sold worldwide against 320 million years ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (estimated 580 million units) and will be almost 10% of the world ' s card market (6,925 million maps).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest point of view: 400,000 contactless Visa maps are available.
But big stores are growing faster.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to supply their clients with equipment.
“Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute non-contact bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nebuy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using their mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the development of a future payment fund, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (Communication of the Middle Field) technology necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they really have to fly away next year."
“We are counting on world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will be provided with non-contact slippers for approximately 200 clients and staff.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay on mobile phones.
The terrorist front spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that the Algerians were now convinced of this.
“The means used by the two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two links.
Stolen in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokur and Vensan Delori were apparently killed the following day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation conducted by the French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone SIM cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
An analysis of the calls made indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Majdiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram’s cradle, and the other to a man who is said to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but surely we must wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“For many years it has been known that the sect is receiving financial and creative external support and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Majdiguri, near the mosque, school and with the founder Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means “Western education is a sin” - preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict compliance with sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists from Boko Haram showed special activity by making numerous attacks on police units.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern ewes.
In the past Christmas she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Joss and then another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations Organization would be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia is of concern to all security experts today.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger and Somalis from Al-Shabaab were operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodlake, Jonathan Alain Jouppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
Peace, as shown by the Republican presidential candidates
For China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America’s weakened crisis lead a complex world with simple and more accurate simplification ideas?
If you listen to presidential candidates from Republicans, voters could believe that.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying the details of the statement on foreign policy, which are traditionally the strong side of the Republicans.
The slogans relating to China, Iran and Israel are often mixed.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese in the WTO and accused them of “handling their currency” is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of its entire industry to Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama of China, and the only candidate who understands complex foreign policy, could not overcome the position that fueled emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who holds the bottom of the ratings, remains unheard of.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am chosen, I will stop Iran, he has announced."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his promises to the partner.
Businessman Kane, second in the candidate rating, showed a dissensing lack of knowledge.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power - obviously not knowing that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Rick Perry of Texas, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he stands ready to use the US Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michel Bahman.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy foreign politician.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his voice regarding the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “guys” from Iraq, his plots in Libya, which gave him a reputation for weak politics.
But it's not that simple.
The population considers the national security balance at Obama, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind in sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply equivalent gas to 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate the event with the pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the performance of the orchestra and the search for snacks, the opening of the North Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion and his Dutch counterpart, Mart Rutte, have jointly turned the symbolic valve controlling Russian gas flow into the Western European network.
Under the new pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will reach Western Europe each year with a first pipeline of 1,224 kilometres connecting the Leningrad region to the land of McLenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all consumption by France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
Indeed, the North Stream would allow gas to be transported directly to Germany by avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The two countries will lose part of their power, making it harder for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the Warsaw debates, it did not stop comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet Pact, implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gateway between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already at the end.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, a new artery that organically binds us,” said François Fion, opening a pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom heads who were present in large quantities in Ljubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel trapped in concrete to protect it from anchors of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields that had been left since the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Mueller, secretary of the North Stream company.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without gaps throughout its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian public company would permanently settle off its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we will cross the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So if the gas is leaked, the gas in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems to the unlikely designers who designed the seams that were designed to flow only once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by an internal gas pipeline.
The cigarette-forming device shall be inserted inside a pipe with a diameter of 1 m and shall be pushed forward by the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of metal.
The pipeline has been designed for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
The gas circulation is carried out only by pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to implement the project.
Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the capital, remains the leader.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called the North Stream, which has been commissioned to build and operate a pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Tsuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay the full amount, no matter how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Mueller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30 per cent shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of work will be 7.4,000 million euros for two pipelines.
The investments of GDF Suez will be around 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will pay their costs because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore planted with rippled trees.
Ventiles 4.5 metres high form the gas output terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before switching it to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received 1 million cubic metres of gas every hour.
This will be 3 million per hour at full capacity and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brand Notepad
Molestine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has the aroma of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine Block is easy to find on a rectangular black cover, on a rubber, on a yellow-white page, as if it were time-consuming.
However, Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant of the company, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The block is inspired by the old production technique, the molasses, the lacquered boy’s paperwork used, for example, to cover the scarves.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for the vanguard artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregundi, who had since become the manager of the Modo Modo brand.
Good luck.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first years when only 3,000 blocks were produced.
Moleskine crossed the Italian border and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer because the notebook equally attracts businessmen, students and people of free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
A small Italian company, which originally had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks at Fnac bookstores, shops in small towns and has become widely known.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the emergence of an e-mail”, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition “The Around Road”, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the cover with a leopard painting on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using his success and cultural aura, Moleskine has varied his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
The success that led to envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, which has incorporated a new page into the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among workers with disabilities so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons with disabilities seek employment.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disturbing?
“No,” stresses Eric Blanche, Director-General of Adapt, an organization that organizes the week of employment of persons with disabilities.
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times as high."
"There's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, more are older: 37 per cent are over 50 (17 per cent on average).
They are rather low in qualifications: 80 per cent have no baccalaureate and 2.3 million have only 10,000 disabled students in higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, is very common compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all of these are criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and which are the essence of the problem," said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre on behalf of Cité showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “presented themselves as total people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally inadequate”.
The result is private companies with more than 20 employees still far from the goal of having 6 per cent of disabled workers in the 1987 Act.
The latest figures known for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
“Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blan.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, in particular in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers against 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.), Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We will not come before we claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
As they sat next to the arena of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after the departure of his attacker in a match against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move on," assures Lille's playboy.
As for the contrast between his achievements at the club and the assembly, that's one thing, he's justified.
"I'm in Lille for a year, and there's no one in Belgium."
"I have to earn points."
Left in reserve, ahead of this match with France, against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in St. Deni to finally "brighten".
Not to be forgotten, however, is the concept of pleasure.
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the special character of the match.
And most certainly, what is on the other side is Matthew, Johan, and Adil,” he remembers.
"It's just our paths crossed."
"A chance to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered "pravity."
"Pride" in the "festive match."
“Pride” is also claimed as “neighbourly”, that France “became a very high-level team” only a year after the trauma in Naizna.
"Lauran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium has missed the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly on a blue-headed plane... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We build something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal begins its response match against Bosnia (22 p.m.) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paula Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Recruitment, which he has been driving since September 2010, has qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and there's Bosnia to win.
Given the 0-0 on Friday in Zenica hell, it's clear that the game isn't over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for more than an hour, it had failed to achieve the consensual goal that would calm it down.
"This is a good result which, however, entails a certain risk."
But at his brightly lit de la Luce Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the audience, who should be thrilled, even though the match will be very intense," said the optimistic but judgmental Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50 per cent chance of going to Euro 2012," said Carlusz Kajros' successor.
No one in the match against Bosnia on Friday demands victory from the Portuguese.
No one could set up Bosnians.
"This is a good result, but there is some risk," regrets Benta.
“We will play against a team with a lot of technical dignity and a lot of individual dignity for the players”, he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, not to give them time to think.
It's a good idea for her to be realistic just this once.
