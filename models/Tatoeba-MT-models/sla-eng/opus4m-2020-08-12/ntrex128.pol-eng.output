Members of the Wales National Assembly fear that they will be called Muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, there has been a controversy, which is the effect of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament.
The idea was due to plans to change the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party expressed concern about his group, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means departures.
One of the politicians of the Playd Cymru party said that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name. He noted, however, that the word "MP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter “w” is pronounced similarly to the letter “u” in the English dialect Yorkshire.
The committee currently working on the draft law amending the name adopted the following position at the assembly: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be their own."
The Act of Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal and the conversion of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of members of the Assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", the WMP in English, although the short term "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The members of the assembly propose alternative solutions: difficulties in reaching consensus are a disaster for Elin Jones, the president of the assembly, who should present the draft law in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules on the dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
In the coming Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be named the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help to say good-bye to the ongoing decades of controversy with Greece's neighbour, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on change of name, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, plebiscite supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
The calls in the New York Church of St. Marcin are silent about problems affecting churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at the moment."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Currently people are given company in a different way," he noted.
"Barry has ceased to be a regular meeting place for members of the community."
In the case of churches, he is concerned, however, that the funds from the sale of property are not sufficient for as long as the decision-makers believe and that they "will sooner or later be at the point of exit".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in such buildings will be of the white race, which will speed up the complete closure of the churches, since it is unlikely that the new inhabitants will become members of these parishes. ”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the Metropolitan Community in 1870 (the Church of Saint Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The original gathering of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
The nearby African - American convention then took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by a meeting led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against sellers from 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell band.
Reverend David Johnson, John Howard Johnson's son and his successor at St. Marcin's church, proudly called the new carillon "the call of the poor".
The expert who rang the bells in July described them in a different way, such as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also noted that this is the world's first carillon supported by black music. The artist was Dionysio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the Church of Riverside Church, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcin's church didn't replace him.
In recent months a number of complex events involving architects and performers have taken place in the church of St. Marcin, some of them being brought by the church’s secular leaders and some by the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a parish management body made up of secular leaders) directed its concerns to the dioceses, claiming that it “wants to shift the costs to the council”, although the council did not take part in the recruitment of architects and performers sent to the post.
Part of the parishioners also complain of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old diver looking for lobsters in California
The authorities reported that last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they came to the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first the boy seemed excited about catching a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around the collar.
“I started yelling at everyone to escape from the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Children's Hospital Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, the rescue officer, Captain Larry Giles, said that the fish had been observed a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim sustained serious injuries to the upper torso.
In order to conduct the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Shop Network plans to expand its activities on the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws gloves at shops such as Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, introducing cosmetics related to stores, as well as specially trained sellers into its supermarkets.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household articles – 11 online stores will show up with more cosmetic products. If the initiative succeeds next year, it will be extended to the next points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to build the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer as many as 3,000 articles. For the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweiserman and Dr. Paw Paw will appear in the product range.
The currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of Boutique make-up products. From now on, most articles will be friendly to vegans, which younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will create test points in two supermarkets in Sainsbury's. The first opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local shops makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that sales points would be increasingly similar to commercial houses because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than foodstuffs.
Sainsbury's placed Argos's network in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat network points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food products and increased profitability of investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise sections with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
In the early 21st century Sainsbury's set up a joint venture company with Boots. However, cooperation ended in a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduced a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to the company Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for a sum of 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing an extended offer of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of the cosmetics departments to improve the impressions of customers.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so that they can help consumers while shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all the needs and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to draw the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of shopping."
Peter Jones "fed" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, star of the Dragons' Dan television program, was “angered” when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the £11 million life-style brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activity was repeatedly compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
The sudden decision to abandon the well-prosperous lifestyle brand and focus on the newly established cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV made by Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that because of new contracts worth up to £1.5 million, she would not have time to sacrifice their brand offering accessories and articles of the Truly household.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand. It was also intended to double Holly Willoughby's assets to £11 million.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave Truly by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby at Instagram, Peter Jones left Great Britain, going to one of his summer homes.
“ The Truly Mark was a priority for Holly Willoughby, ” reports the source.
She tied her future to her, and she wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
"In Marlowe Magazine, there's goods ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of this Morning and one of Britain's biggest success stars can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investment in products – covering articles from candles to clothing and household articles – and will also lead to further delays in entering the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband, Dan Baldwin, maintained a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and Peter Jones, 52, joined them in March as president.
Couples spent vacations together, and Jones had a 40% share in the television production company that belongs to Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source similar to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business. ”
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the media criticism caused by the comments made, which some considered to be “unbecoming husband of the state, ” as well as a positive attitude toward North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trump with a large step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "similar response" from the United States to early North Korean disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead the United States supported sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we're having a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had brought positive results: they had led to the completion of rocket tests, helped free hostages and return the other US soldiers to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to behave after the presidency. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered right in front of us.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the Lomboku population, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support. This is a difficult situation," said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international staff will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although shelters were built in the province of Aceh in case of tsunamis, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a warning siren to the tsunami in Palu – despite the warning – is likely to have an impact on the number of fatalities.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travel between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is heading for help for the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the target.
President Joko Vidodo made improving Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration is facing a lack of resources.
Moreover, Joko Vidodo was under pressure because of the ongoing religious tensions in the country, and members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of people lost their lives as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons in the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins the draw gate with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in England's Premier League, winning the Gate in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a dose from Xherdan Shaqiri approximately 27 metres from Chelsea Gate at 1-0 for the benefit of his team.
Before taking the shot towards the remote gate, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball moved high above the criminal field towards the right upper right corner of the net.
Then she came to the gate, flying over the prowling Cape Arrizabalaga.
“I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to move it as far ahead as possible. I wanted to give myself the best chance to shoot” said Sturridge in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I noticed Kantego approaching, I took the ball and gave the shot without thinking more deeply about it."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of a match at the gates of the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues kicked the ball in the heel to Mateo Kovacicia, and then ran towards the direction of the Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
Then he played a beautiful game ahead in the criminal field back to Hazard.
Gambling was ahead of the defenders, and he put his left foot in the direction of a long bar of arrows that passed Liverpool's front doorman, Alison Becker.

Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country increased to 832.
During the conference, the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho announced that as a result of Friday's 7.5-degree earthquake, many people were trapped on Richter's scale.
The city of Palu, inhabited by over 380,000 people, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman

A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are requesting contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious events.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of Investigations, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all the people who are then in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also refer to all drivers, and in particular taxi drivers, whose registrs may have maintained material useful during the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people who claim to know a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police reported that he was in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.

Cromwell's monument to the British Parliament the last victim in a dispute over "writing history over again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban’s like - minded destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society Association, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over Oliver Cromwell’s character before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The imagery during the English domestic wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the actions of his forefather Thomas were previously punished by the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on the monument shows how much this 19th - century politician felt and how much he was still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people viewed Cromwell – perhaps more often in the 19th century than today – as a defender of Parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of how correct this statement is is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid - 17th century formed a further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and remembered."
In China, there was a fatal carnage of a farmer by a pig
According to local media, there was a fatal attack on a farmer at a fair in the southwestern part of China.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a severed artery near the barn at the Liupanshui Fair in Kuejczou Province.
The pig farmer prepares for vaccination in pigs on 30 May 2005, Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man came to the fair with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found the body of a man and noticed an open door to a nearby barn.
He said there was a big pig in the barn with blood on it.
The autopsy section confirmed that it was about 250 kilos of pig that killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mangled,” said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
On the material from the surveillance camera you can see that Yuan arrived at the fair Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The store manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that during the collection of evidence by the police, the pig was isolated in order to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the men's family and the trade authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
Pig attacks against humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier in Wales, nearly 300-pound pig drove the farmer into the tractor.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can release brutal behaviour in them.
"They just want to have fun.
They're as touchy as kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them proper respect," he said.
Remnants after storms of Rosa will cause heavy rain in the southwestern part of the United States
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing power, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause intense rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa swings at nearly 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern time it was given category 1. It was then 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of damp air northward to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of Mexico.
In the following days, the damp tropical air that comes in contact with the lower rains in the Southwest of the United States will cause.
In some places, rainfall between 2.5 cm and 10 cm will lead to emergency floods, the movement of pollution and possible landslides.
The damp tropical air will cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even between 5 cm and 10 cm of rain is projected in some parts of the Southwest of the United States, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods and sudden changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, walking through the desert is strongly encouraged.
The floods can change the canyons in the river’s ripples, and lightning storms can cause local wind and dust to flow.
Coming before it brings abundant local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
There may be rains of a total height of more than 1,3 cm, which may cause small movements of pollutants and road hazards.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Summer tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, rainfall will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, temperature fluctuations may occur in the Arctic region throughout the United States, but in the inter-return zone it will be rather warm.
This may lead to rapid changes in the temperature at small distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature difference in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City (the state of Missouri) and Omaha (the state of Nebraska) and St. Louis (the state of Missouri) and Des Moines (the state of Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, warm early October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the south of the Great Plains to the north east.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures can reach up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C], or about 5 degrees Fahrenheit [5 ° C] above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh auditions
More than 20 million people watched six television stations addressing Thursday’s interview with Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political coup on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt regularly broadcast programmes to inform of the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the shadow court committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was squeezing her in a state of impatience and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In his emotional statement, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation had not happened.
It is possible that Friday's number of TVs was even higher than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of TV stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, numerical data were not yet available.
Moreover, Nielsen is usually having difficulty measuring audiences in the workplace.
The number given is similar to the viewership of American Football Cups or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to reports from Nielsen Fox News Channel, whose presentation strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, it had the highest ratings.
In the second place was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became the key character of Friday's events.
In the morning, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions, and the whole event was transmitted by CNN.
"I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women's infirmities," he heard from a woman who was demonstrating.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the committee's hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events waiting to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he'd only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, which was insisted on by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced after part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into charges brought against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview given to Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and challenging national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham (United Kingdom), 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the title page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, which would allow the United Kingdom and the EU to collect duties on their behalf, calling it "totally ridiculous".
Wade Sims's shooting: police arrested Dytheon Simpson's suspect in the murder of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports by the police in Baton Rouge, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and placed in custody on second-degree murder charges.
The authorities published a video of a confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a related WAFB station, police officers found these glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
The police informed Simpson that he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer in custody, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and neck injury.
The Police Command thanked the search party of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU sports, thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "workiness and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The measuring 198 cm man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"This is one of the things we are constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ashes extracted from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center recorded numerous stabbings and shocks.
Photographs published in social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexican neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that visited Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcano activity 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has remained active since 1994.
Police launches with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six people were arrested as a result of old demonstrators supporting Catalonia's independence with the police's prevention units. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme emotions of the referendum on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separation supporters threw eggs and powder paint at police officers.
The effort was also made in the later part of the day, and the police used sticks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, groups supporting independence chanted, "We do not forget, we do not forgive." Opponents of secession shouted, "Let Spain live."
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical attention in connection with minor injuries caused during the protests.
The year after the referendum of October 1st, the tension did not weaken. Although the authorities in Madrid considered them illegal, it is still a cause for celebration for the wanted Catalonian secession.
The majority voted in favour of independence, but the frequency was low due to the widespread boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year in brutal shootings with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations supporting the police.
The demonstration nevertheless took place, but the route was forced to change.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said there was no hope of independence from Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck in a place without a way out," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, parties supporting the Catalonia secession are having difficulty continuing their activities. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old phone mechanic who recorded a police-supported protest, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute fueled the conflict.
"The situation is becoming more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained at the end of last year, announced a desire to launch the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Candidature in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested following several car strikes in a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 a.m. British Time (BST).
Investigative commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage took over the gate and the building.
At some point towards the car could also be given a shot from the bow.
Mengi Gate provides Livingstone's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengi's first goal for Livingston has won the team.
Since this season, the Livingston Club has brought the Rangers into shock, giving Steven Gerrard only a second defeat in his 18 matches at the Ibrox Park club coach's position.
Dolly Mengi's goal was to win, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team under Gerrard's leadership is not winning this season at the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, who loses eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA League.
Livingstone is extending his division's winnings to six matches, and Coach Holt has not failed since his replacement in office last month, Kenny Miller.
Livingstone missed a few opportunities against unavailable opponents
Holt's team was supposed to be running much earlier, because the team's game gave Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson made his way through the defense and put a shot in the light of the gate, but he couldn't score a goal, and then Alan Lithgow didn't make it after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant fragments of the game.
And that's how the decisive gate fell.
After the Rangers took over the free throw, Livingston found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Menga, who gained the goal from the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't force the hosts to defend themselves, and they didn't cause much trouble for goalie Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by the Rangers' goalie Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to get into the light of the gate from another permanent fragment tried for Livingstone.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingston penal field, but they were unable to take advantage of the situation. Two criminal attacks after Halkett's intervention against the shapeshifter Glenn Middleton and one hand game. In both cases, however, the claims of the players were rejected.
"Phenomenal" performance of Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingstone.
In his opinion, they played beautifully, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed from return to extra class. However, you should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to play.
This game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a major role in a well-organized defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although Gerrard's leadership has given them great moments, they have not maintained their standards in the match.
In their game there seemed to be something missing: only once did they break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany. Visits aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After meeting Erdogan, he went to Colony, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside its home country.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered outside the temple was blocked, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – have also decided to express their opinion by condemning the Turkish leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt policies in the country.
On the contrary, the protests reflect the divisions raised by the visit of a politician who was shouted by a part of the Turks living in Germany and recognised as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died as a result of a car crash
A cyclist suffered death after a car crash in London.
There was an accident near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 British time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and the paramedics arrived. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene.
A few months ago, on Childers Street (about a mile away from the scene of the Saturday accident) there was another fatal accident involving a cyclist.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the officers were working on identifying the deceased man and informing them of the events of family members.
The roads were closed and bus tours were arranged, and drivers were instructed to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin penal facility: six officers were injured as a result of riots
According to the authorities, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a men's prison with a higher level of security.
The HMP Long Lartin detention facility in Worcestershire started on Sunday around 9:30 British Time (BST) and continues.
A special unit called Tornado was called to launch eight prisoners in one of the facility's wings.
The officers on the scene took minor facial injuries.
The company’s spokesman said: “HMP Long Lartin’s special training staff was involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our establishments. We are convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October of last year, prevention units were called to the plant because of dangerous riots in which workers were attacked by billiard bullets.
The sudden floods caused by the hurricane, Rosa, threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a possible beneficial impact on drought areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remains after the storms of Rosa move through the desert areas of the South West, creating a threat to the sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of an emergency on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to Tuesday's forecast, Rosa will be directly over Phoenix and rain will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept the storm or tropical depression 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) came within 65 km of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas of Mogollon Rome in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the South West, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Cotline, the amount of rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 cm and 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
The rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa can bring relief to those outside the areas threatened by sudden floods, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, part of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought is taking place.
According to the weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of the Arizona area struggles with affected droughts belonging to the second of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to travel with the force of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is currently located 620 km south of the Eugenia Punta in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
It is predicted that it will strike Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
The Weather.com portal reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of the state of Sonora, rainfall is expected to reach between 7 cm and 15 cm, although it may reach 25 cm”.
Then Hurricane Rosa will cross Mexico in the north in the form of a tropical storm. Tuesday, early in the morning, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will wander to the southern part of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-west of Sonora and in the south-western desert areas of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Center.
According to forecasts, rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollution in the desert and mud avalanches in the mountainous region.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old man found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, about 4:00 a.m. British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to a hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, one 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - old, and a 20 - year - old man were arrested in the vicinity of Radstock at night.
Officers are requesting contact with all persons who have recorded the event.
Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh had “feeling mean and angry ” with the Democratic Party
"The vote cast against Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the absolute and indignant conduct of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the council in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “felt the bitterness and anger ” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the congress, and firmly and emotionally denied the charges against Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when both were teenagers, the man committed sexual assault on her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "The Americans could see about Kavanaugh's brilliance, class and courage."
"The vote cast on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of support from one of the most famous lawyers of our time, a lawyer of the law of great merit for the community," he said before a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of the Republicans' participation in half the presidential elections.
"The most important choices in our lives divide us into five weeks.
I do not run in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump claims that Democrats have a policy of "putting up and making things harder".
As CNN said one of the assistants of the important Republican Party policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed – many of whom were abducted by high waves crashing over the beach – following a severe earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds gathered on the beach to take part in a festival in the city. At dusk, waves reached up to 6 meters high, taking many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat arose yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to the tsunami”, said the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters' spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, hijacking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho said.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photos published by the Natural Disaster Agency show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was plagued by secondary shocks.
There have been a number of earthquakes in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the atomic bomb energy dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement found that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the effects of tsunamis.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said that fatalities and injuries could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Pal, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication "was completely paralyzed", and there are no reports from Donggal Province.
“There are over 300,000 people living there” can be read in the statement of the Red Cross. It is also added that the workers and volunteers of the organization will go to places affected by the disaster.
“Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may have worsened significantly,” said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism of the lack of information on the impact of the tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities stated that the waves came just after the warning was given.
On the amateur recording made available in the social media, you can see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn of the approaching tsunamis of people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall crashed ashore, hijacking buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to confirm immediately the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within the Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated continue to need food and other basic items of the first need.
The airport located in the city is open only for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
President Joko Vidodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Over 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay reported, the National Director of the World Vision, the staff of the organization arrived safely from Donggal Province to Palu and found shelter in tents from a spa resort situated in the office area.
"They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly starting to deliver aid, there are criticisms that workers from foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience are not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, the admission of funding, resources and staff from abroad can only begin after the disaster has been declared a national disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the Indonesian spokesman for the Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not yet happened."
After two days of Friday’s earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing continue to live hoping that their loved ones will somehow find themselves among the destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who spent two days in the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandno, coach of the Indonesian paralytic team, trained two missing paratroopers participating in the Asian Games in Indonesia this month.
As Peter Mandagi said, other persons trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples.
"As an experienced paratrooper, I am dealing with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandno told how within a few hours of the arrival among the community of paratroopers information about the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel desperately sent messages by communicator WhatsApp to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked only by one gray hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 in cash in an ATM at Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police report Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was cashing cash in an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
“The car driver was emptying the ATM in an entertainment complex and was getting ready to cash in, ” wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published communication.
Another man "ran from behind to a worker of Brink" and stole a bag of cash into an ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not report how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are requested to contact the police command in Newport, number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
As he announced his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: “A person previously known as Kanye West”.
Forty-one-year-old music has been using Ye’s nickname for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before the visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace the songwriter Ariane Grande, who, according to the creators, gave up “for emotional reasons”.
West has already stated that the word “Ye” is not only a shortcut to his current artistic nickname, but a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means ‘You’,” said West earlier in the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is about us.
At first I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West is in the midst of other famous rappers who have decided to change their name.
Sean Combs known under the alias Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, a former associate of West's, also wrote his alias in different ways, with the link, without the link, and in capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Oberador undertakes not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) of Mexico made a commitment never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday at the Square of Three Cultures López Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire in the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as by creating more free public schools.
He said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities for young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies, along with the increase in China's activity in this area, the US should double its spending on research in SI.
The comments made relate to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan to become the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"To begin with, the budget for research on SI should be doubled: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week with CNBC, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of another breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create the SI system, which beat the best American player then to Othello.
Lee acknowledged the success of earlier US government technological initiatives, e.g. organised by the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the deadline for the next edition of the competition, as he said it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
"It is not China that takes away the best representatives of academic communities, but corporations," said Lee.
For several years Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in SI development.
“I believe that those who have acquired a doctor’s degree in artificial intelligence should be automatically granted a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published a plan to create the artificial intelligence of the next generation.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Science Foundation of China provides funding to academic institutions in a manner similar to the American National Science Foundation and other government organisations that grant funding to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Elect Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also informed about the allocation of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to create a national committee on artificial intelligence security has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow the movement to say goodbye to several decades of dispute with Greece, which is blocking the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is located in the historic province of Macedonia, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory and has therefore pledged to join the EU and NATO.
In June, however, the two governments reached an agreement on the title, and nationalists say that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia's inhabitants.
President Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign that encouraged boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the post-Yugoslav countries – to organisations such as the European Union and NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us all with greater security," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
A change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the Members of Parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that no unusual events had been recorded until 13 p.m.
However, the frequency of this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections. At that time, 66% of the eligible people voted.
"I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife, Zorica and his son, Duszko, gave a vote in a referendum on the change in the name of the country to open the way for NATO and the European Union.
Before the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kwardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents distributed by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with our heads down, not the back door," said Kwardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of changing the name in the referendum because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after the vote.
He said that voting for "yes" is a "reaffirmation of our future".
In a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required frequency.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote in Sunday's referendum.
70% of respondents said they'd support the change of name.
In order for the vote to end successfully, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The referendum defeat would have been the first major blow to the pro-Western government policy since last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats all of Brighton's defenses and gets the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home in Saturday's 2-0 meeting for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate acquired by Agua in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began at the centre of the field to an Argentine attacker.
The football player outrun three Brighton defenses.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
First he played one of them, and then he ran over the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the criminal field, which defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper by shooting at the right side of the gate.
“Aguero struggles with a foot injury” said Manchester City's coach Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at the time."
However, Sterling provided the blue with the first match in the Premier League.
The gate in question fell in 29 minutes.
In action, this Aguero got a ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great shot along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sanne made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant pole.
Manchester City's attacker directed the ball to the grid just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Group Stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will take place at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of Rocky's victory.
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to play first.
However, Scherzer's favorite rivalry hopes to perform in Sunday's meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only the Rockies keep the chances of a performance in the playoffs phase. Currently, the team has one more victory than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's meeting against Nationals score 5:2. However, they still want their first title as Division Master.
"Although we play 'nothing', at least we will go out on the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in this meeting?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday's meeting, but the team is inclined to exhibit Scherzer in the first squad.
It would be Scher's thirty-fourth performance in the first set. The contestant took part in Thursday's pitch and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-hand thrower of the team from Washington scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the matches and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the Republicans' participation in half the presidential elections.
"In November, we are putting all the achievements so far on the line.
Five weeks apart from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our wonderful candidates," he said.
He went on to say: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by every means possible.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resisting and hindering activities".
"It was very good to see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad, evil, unpleasant and untrue".
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling from the name and name of the American senator from the Democratic Party Diane Feinstein, who met a loud noise from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
"Uh, I'm listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerable to people expressing their own opinions
When the momentum operatives in my party voted in favour of giving me a nudity, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am a member of the Labour Party Group, which was recently told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for repulsion was based on a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and, ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders in these matters.
On Friday's announcement of a meeting of MPs of the Nottingham East Labour Party could be read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I have been serving as the Labour Party's Member for most of the afternoon Friday meetings of the General Committee, this is what it looked like.
Unfortunately, a lot of meetings are going on differently at the moment, and the promise of a "heartier and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all began shortly after Jeremy Corby's presidency. Colleagues who seemed to me to have similar views began to expect me to change directions and positions that I would not agree with earlier, and they dealt with issues such as national security or the EU's single market.
After every public statement – regardless of the content – I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, the condemnation of centrism or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I'm making at my address are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with resentment from others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a "vote of mistrust" and every change in the rules of choice of the party's worldview is narrowed down.
Over the past two years, I have repeatedly suggested that I do not bend over and remain silent on certain issues.
That's not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the collapse of my school class, I have been trying to improve the quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councilman and minister.
I never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East County knew my position and knew about differences of opinion with the party authorities.
I would like to say to those who supported the Friday proposal that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the president of the laboratory in the face of the approaching Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threat of withdrawing nominations or immediate political objectives will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr v Melrose 38:17 – Unbeatable Ayr again
Two late applications may have somehow distorted the final result. However, it is not doubtful that the Ayr team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting game of the Scottish extraliga.
The team took first place in the table and remains the only unbeatable team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of opportunities led the team of hosts to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been pleased with his caregivers.
"The games we have so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still unbeatable, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: “We have to pay tribute to Ayr’s players.
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson's application and the upgrade of Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's Scots, who came to the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to level the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an untapped chance of a raise.
Climo increased Ayr's leadership after kicking out of the penalty shot just before the first half ended. First he got an application, and then he took the opportunity to raise, obtaining a score 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose got the second half right. Patrick Anderson's application raised by Baggott reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer stop due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott. The competitor was removed from the field on the stretchers. After re-Ayr increased the lead after applying Stafford McDowall and raising climate.
Next, Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used her number: an application with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the conduct.
The masters took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting climate without a ball. MacPherson gained a grip on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the opportunity to raise. Then again he managed to raise the score right after he resumed the game when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from the penalty shot and enabled Wing Gregor Henry to get a fifth application for the host.
The star of the Still Game series starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game, seems to be starting a business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he became director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor is enrolled as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC station sitcom. He is performing and co-creates a series together with his multi-year comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the coming ninth season will be the last in the history of the show. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this subject, although informer Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the "growing gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": denied access to the sea of Bolivia is the hope that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines patrol the vicinity of the La Paz Navy Base.
There are blue flags coming from public buildings.
In the ports of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to regain it."
In the lack of access to the sea of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest for several decades, and Bolivia is looking forward to the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is due to be issued on 1 October following a five-year trial.
“The actions of Bolivia are on the move. The inhabitants are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favourable verdict”, said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will jointly watch the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organisation based in The Hague will recognise Bolivia's claim and after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to negotiate an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will stand for the upcoming controversy of the struggle for re-election next year, also looks forward to Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favourable decision for Bolivia are low and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations agency based in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile, and it also reserves that it will not affect the establishment of any possible talks.
As Paz Zárate said, Chilean specialist in international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments.
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years could have distanced the country from its goal.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
The irresistible rhetoric of Morales deprived the Chileans of any remnant of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in terms of relations with Chile" and the possibility "to end the 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — was using the issue of access to the sea as part of a political game.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an excellent opportunity to believe that we must deal with the past."
North Koreans say nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at a time when US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appeared to be on the verge of a resumption of suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "frozen" is as if the lack of sanctions and the opposition of the US against the declaration ending the Korean war has ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without the prior adoption of concrete disarmament measures by Pjongjang.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjongjang is taking seriously the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of ensuring security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month as part of preparations for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
Paris fashion shows announce the emergence of the latest line of great head covering in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a number of crazy, extra-dimension-covered heads in their summer 2019 collection, which brightened with style during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
The most impractical hats were on Instagram this summer, and these designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered panting of models.
Other super-dimensional accessories included jewelry ornaments, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — but were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of special masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had a sewn mouth and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with pipes and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can be found in clothing stores.
Undimensionable hats follow “La Bomba, ” a strawed hat with a wide 61 - cm [61 cm] roonde that everyone was wearing — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which was passed through the social media, presented another great creation on the run — a broken beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in a bathing suit.
The burnt orange Rafi bag, finished with the coat of arms and with the white leather handle, was distinguished in the Jacques La Riviera collection for the summer 2019 season during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, said: “I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in stores next year — because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be difficult not to take advantage of the demand for excess accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills necessary for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could boast of the next outstanding results of the examinations, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other social projects.
Representatives of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland are striving to ensure the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that is able to develop and implement a school-friendly learning programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another person in a language that he understands, that’s when it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it's in his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year's final exam show that languages take first place in league rankings, with the highest performance rates for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received higher grades of A.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received higher A grades in Mandarin and 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish were also rated A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as an object of choice, is carried out in the same way as that of STEM subjects (teaching, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that 17 per cent of employers' lack of language skills was responsible for the difficulty in filling job vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for the start of their careers.
These skills are necessary in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong skill, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future — regardless of the career path chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person versus competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov involving over 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak in foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of those using it was two digits, i.e. 15%.
That is why investing in learning foreign languages is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ in its language.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered essential for the UK in the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, there will always be many languages in independent schools to choose from, which will be taught by specialised teaching staff in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are involved in creating an environment of learning that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed — regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to be crucial to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just how it's supposed to be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debut on the Lakers team Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers are finally waiting.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James will play a Sunday pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There's no telling how many minutes he'll be playing.
“More than one but less than 48”, Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Laker's team reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James was likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need to participate in pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
So electoral Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of electoral councils.
This is the first of the five election councils planned by Trump to take place next week, along with stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with the vote confirming that he has abstained from his election to serve in the Supreme Trump Court, he seeks to build support in the upcoming elections on the government's peninsula, because the Republicans may be threatened with losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is tonight for the West Virginia Election Trump, and where will it be seen on the Internet?
So the election Trump in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place today at 7 p.m., i.e. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
So the Western Virginia Election Trump can be traced live through the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings by a candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, at the time of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral councils is to support the Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump's campaign with five councils next week aims to "mobilise volunteers and supporters to assist the Republicans in protecting and extending the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's timetable that as the campaign's worst season approaches, it will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's spokesman, who refused to give his name — Reuters.
Today’s electoral event in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, can draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh, ” West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help a West Virginia candidate to the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses his polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the fight, hoping to win Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The quivering momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but one in which players really believe, and most of all in professions like these.
So what's their schedule at this point?
"They ran six points, and now they're only running four, so I think we've got a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads to four points, while there are twelve points before it is achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy role models, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
Screaming all over his throat as a sign of excitement grew louder during his round, drowning the key path and winning the match when he and Thomas won two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them a victory with a result of 15, came with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
"Just focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable Ryder Cup story.
The strange but lovely couple of European teams won four out of four and were not wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't score bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential European team's victory at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they were playing in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning Fourball hero when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
Bogey and a double double on the front of the Nine dug Spain and Sweden into a hole they'd never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help us get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how one moment the strategy may change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken on a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has been cut off from fighting in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome games with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has made a big deal of two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing its score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an incomplete American team in the morning fourball format, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has put up more resistance in the form of foursome, winning two matches, but could not make losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points with 12 singles to be held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (the band was named "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend) are only the second couple in the history of Ryder Cup, who scored four points in four opening matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball style, they beat the pumped Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5–4.
Woods, who got tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed flashes of genius, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, not taking part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stanson in foursome format to beat the results of 2–1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka — World rankings 1 and 3 respectively.
However, not everything went as far as the European team was concerned on this pleasant, cold day in a field set south-west of Paris.
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas established a reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2–1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and came back later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4–3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has the team made a four-point loss by starting singles, although the Furyka team would only have the draw to keep the trophy.
Two days ago, however, Sunday’s counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says "solid no" to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during a UN speech that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of North Korea's confidence in the United States and there is no way that country unilaterally renounces nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good will measures" last year, such as deterrence of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of nuclear testing sites and commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and in such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the famous North Korean complaints about Washington's unwillingness to take a “stage” approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to work for the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States delegation announced that Pjongjang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also relied on calls to mitigate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearisation in the first place' and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, even opposed to signing the 'war-end declaration'," Ri said.
"The proof that sanctions can put us on our knees is that people who treat us in a way that is ignorant.
The problem, however, is that the lack of sanctions will deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the United States leader spoke of at the beginning of the week at the UN forum.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, and not the United States, were to be a party to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, there would be no such imparement.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles in the United States is inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump (Mr. Bad President Trump) called Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” (man rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump forum, which threatened to "complete destruction" in North Korea last year, Kim Jong Una praised his courage to take steps to disarm, but also said that there was much work to be done, and said that until North Korea was stripped of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had not set a time limit for this, saying: “It doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must be continued and continued until we have determined full, final and verified denuclearisation”.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea by trying to strangle the financing of the nuclear programme and the Pjonyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjongjang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which in a few hours North Korea condemned him for "putting in gangster demands".
North Korea committed this month to meeting with Moon Jae-in to dismantle the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes " appropriate measures".
He stated that Kim Jong Un had told him that "the measures" he cared about were the security guarantees that Trump had committed to in Singapore and that it was taking steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a long rest course
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided more sleep for all students in order to combat the growing macho culture, which is based on learning by "all-night students powered by caffeine".
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basis for taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by the talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“After the end of the speech, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why am I being told this only now that I’m in the last year of college?’
She found that no one had ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course that took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, and also improve the general sense of self-esteem of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university health service, said that the course was decided to be introduced after the students were found to suffer from a serious lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in the dormitory where students click cups for coffee, curtains, exercise and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports results, and how important it is to keep sleep regularly.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not cause an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes with each other,” said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride from "all-night science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students is a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring enough sleep with good quality should be a “secret weapon” of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight gain, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to starve, making the student constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all students to complete a similar study programme before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can upset the rhythm of the day and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga gets Gerard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during the struggle to leave Livingstone when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's dismantled team, achieving a score of 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first victory in the February 4-1 triumph over St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team for the second time defeated Gerard in 18 matches, causing his team to differ eight points from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the rangers' lack of commitment did not seem to improve.
While Rangers recorded a fall to sixth place, Livingstone stumbled on the third — just for Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers' team may have further problems with the need to wound the head of Judge Calum Spence's liner after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed us to advance Ayr and move on to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same 11-year-old Livingstone, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, as an admiring way in which his well-trained team was tormented at every turn of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but it was Livingstone who did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first ball shot allowed Scott Pittman to face the Allan McGregor Gate, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, in his position as a defense attorney, could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he needed to be punished 15 minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to give away only two customs shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassana Coulibala's head and the weak shot of Ovie's Ejaria.
While the 34 minute Livingstone goal opening the game could be against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort put into winning it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with the deep, constant piece of the game played by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept the peace, handing it to Menga for a simple end to the action.
Gerrard didn't waste time, and he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to bring guests into the game exactly the way they like when Lithgow and Halkett performed long meals one by one.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor stood up well in front of Jacobs, then Lithgow withdrew the game from the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, hoped once again for the punishment when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now page of our edition of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 – 136 years ago... the day of the German-born physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as the 1950 Bells of Coronado, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboys-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have appeared:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the enemy of the cell.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemy cells as part of the treatment.
This method is to separate the immune cells from the patient and turn them into a laboratory.
Then they can “see” a common protein for many cancers. Then they are injected again into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine who has been taught the immune system to recognise the enemy cells, ovarian cancer has been reported to disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, change them into a laboratory so that they can “see” a common protein for many cancers called HER2 and then inject them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very well-married. ”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancers, ” including breast, ovary, lung and colon, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach is to collect immune cells from patients and to “learn” their location of cancer cells has worked in the treatment of certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West goes on a pro-trump diet in Saturday Night Live, with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was "extorted" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live programme after he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing his third song entitled Ghost Town that night, during which he had a hat with the title “Make America Great, ” he conducted his argument against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"As often as I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I were concerned with racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a shadow court committee on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, the video with West's output was sent to the social media by a comedian named Chris Rock.
There's no telling if Rock was trying to make fun of West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes with his hat.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're after me!
And then they say I have no way out," he said -- Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Are you saying that I have no way out? ”
Let's accept it."
His words twice caused “a stir ” to the public, and the members of the SNL team seemed confused, reports Variety.
West was invited to the program in exchange for a songwriter named Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by performing the song I Love it in the dress of a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from TPUS' conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR MAFIA’S PEACE”.
The lead talk show Karen Hunter on her Twitter said that West was just "being himself and it's absolutely wonderful".
"But I am NOT going to reward people (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art"), which I believe is acceptable and spreading a harmful ideology to my community.
He's free.
We are also free," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that now it is "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name – he follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then an artist previously known as Prince.

Star Game of the throne Kit Harrington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO HBO's medieval HBO "Game of Thrones".
A 31-year-old actor struck at the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the Game of Thrones plan, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt "very safe," addressing the issue.
"I personally feel pretty sure at this point -- where did we make a mistake in the matter of manhood?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly due to the appearance of a very male character.
He continued: “What attitudes are inborn, and what are the things learned?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It's obvious that there's not everything wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel Game of Thrones after the end of the series next year, saying that he “completed with the fields of battle and horses”.
Since November, Kit will be playing "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently declared that knowing his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"On the plan I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award - winning Emmy fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in the character played by Kita, Jon Snow.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the territory of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China sees 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as health workers in the country report.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spreads rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV was almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to insufficient insurance during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has made HIV medicines widely available as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies it as if one of her team members had disclosed the data of the Republicans' senators — "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory".
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dismissed the allegations as if a member of her team had placed the personal data of three Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia's vice-legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Party of Democrats has ensured that these charges have been brought by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wings".
"Lictions, lies and even more vile lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
Public information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a panel hearing at the Senate on allegations of sexual offences against the Supreme Court-designated, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a while after questioning Kavanaugh's candidacy by three senators.
The conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about the Waters team member, Hill reports.
"This baseless charge is totally false and it is a hundred percent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and it is a hundred percent lie."
Waters quickly criticized the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This is the way of denying it is wrong," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
He must remain calm for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"A rough case, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent accusations. ”
"The perpetrators will be exposed and held legally responsible for all their actions which pose a threat to any of the members of my team," she said.
Johnny English Review: Knockout — Spy Parade with Weak Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British thread has already become the norm. It seems to apply to a new part of the series of films from the stock and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the movies in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-inflicted satyr of how hopeless we are become the new export product of the country?
In any case, forever surprised, characterized by a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English has again been given a partial license — his name and name more than anything else signals that he is an advanced, comical product designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange appeal to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasie Bean and a drop of this guy adding one note to the tune of the theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man — Atkinson once played in the forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, in which he left chaos.
In the latest Johnny English series, there is one or two moments worth mentioning.
I very much liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was struck rhythmically by the shovels of the rotor.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson to play comedy physically, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially since at present also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Imposible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be directed towards children rather than adults — I think Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as creative and consistent as the gags in their Atkinson films about Yasio Beans.
The current assumption is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker infiltrates the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the horror of a service agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the magic of a bitter prime minister who is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power by embodying herself in the form of Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her intelligence advisors are informing her that because of the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means Johnny English's failure in his own self, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving informal lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few good gags while teaching a spy lesson by English.
English is called to Whitehall for a review, reconnecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine — a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin party in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously overpowered by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems — Jason Volt's prey, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their cruise with absurd situations: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; introduce chaos by moving on board the luxury yacht Volta; and English sows desolation when using the set for virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite the nice and loud performance, the whole film is very much like television for children.
It's a typical middleman.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suited his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan that provides for the British for a four-week work week for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to hand over the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of remuneration.
Sources say that this idea "will fit" into the economic agenda of the party and plans to leave the country against the workers.
The transition to a four-week work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
Senior member of the Labour Party said in a conversation with The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced by the end of this year.”
"It will not happen day by day, but a four-week work week is something that is part of the party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the employee, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party undertook to introduce a four-week work week during the electoral campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-week work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it."
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "directors without a face" and "specculators" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share because the Labour Party government could make "declarations" based on detected abuses.
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees in company boards and the creation of integrated equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector own capital to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are answering the 60 minutes program to see if the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case can change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question whether the findings of the investigating office could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's 60 minutes interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that could change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his friend from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the charge came, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined and clear."
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and a strong charge is needed to change it," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No person who served could verify this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's going to change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival, and has it to any extent contributed to poverty reduction?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York on the next Saturday, an annual musical event that can be honored by the impressive composition of the stars that are on display and by the equally impressive mission of eradicating poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists, by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, making a phone call or other significant activities to increase awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen boast in the future of the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is it another case of so-called "clictivism" when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or putting an entry on Twitter?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” of people supporting action, aiming to achieve many different objectives.
It also states that these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth over $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which have already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The Group estimates that the safeguards have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and implementers involved in "helping children achieve their full potential", which promised to hand over $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens sent over 4700 tweets.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustice, such as malnutrition, history” — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, live in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the quality of mother and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with food problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was, "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?"
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will meet and fail.
But as in the case of the major civil rights and apartheid movements in the past, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars of this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" flee to its warship to prevent the flow of Russian energy into the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire for mediation in energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this problem.
"The United States, on the issue of its warship, has the opportunity to make sure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as "the voice of the consumer of energy" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are in reality the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is about to use and replace fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "one-fiction puppy" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when Trump's administration is continuing a mission aimed at increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is designed to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a project of pure economic character.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's bitter opposition to the project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I believe that this is a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government. This is also the case with the highest-ranking woman," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy for the presidency."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trumpe, saying that he "leads the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
On Thursday, however, the poll showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters from Massachusetts who chose the option “probably” said that the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The survey showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed him.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account with regard to the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about the trauma stress syndrome (PTSD) Track Palin during the election council Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after being dragged into the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, which he must go through after returning, I understand other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with”, Donald Trump told the public on the electoral council in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son “the theme of the taboo, ” then she said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little different, come back hard, come back, wondering whether respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other members of the military have given to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasili, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence on a woman, urging false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun in a state of imprudentity, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasili Police Department.
18 states and District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for a new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 states and district representatives submitted a list of amicus curic to support asylum seekers who are struggling with this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the cause of Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal politics in August, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his brutal sons from the gang ” had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
A new American asylum policy has reversed the 2014 Board of Immigration Applications decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Ratine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has been ignoring state, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle" as stated in the list of amicus curic.
Prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that policies denying entry to immigrants harm the economy of the United States, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"A asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the background of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such and not other political beliefs," said Sessions in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum never meant to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people around the world struggle with every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu in a situation where the number of fatalities has doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
"It is a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her bitter son at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
‘An ambulance shall import the body every minute.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching over water - laden things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 - degree earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some wounded, including two Harris, who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed into a wall" – Harris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then her voice went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "torture" propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American-Chinese daily, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily’s paying allowance in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere with the United States Congress elections to be held on November 6 — China denies this accusation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections confirmed what US officials said to Reuters that it was a new stage in escalating Washington's campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently in the process of escalating the trade war, which has led to a rise in customs tariffs on mutual imports.
Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to touch exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party — Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former state governor of Iowa, China’s chief exporter of agricultural products, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China “now with a double force starts harassment by placing propaganda in our own free press”.
“As a result of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no opposition in the street theater in Beijing, and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic direction, given that the media is under strong control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans bully women with voting rights before mid-term elections through Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many of the leading Republicans support and defend the weapons nominated for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially on the part of women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
“ This can’t be undone, ” said an article published on Saturday by Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon)'s efforts to investigate the last minute of the FBI's investigation were enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it by November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman of the MovementOn Group, reported the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protestors chanted the slogan “The November Coming,” demonstrating in the Senate Hall because of the decision of the Republicans controlling the Commission of the Court not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, according to Mic.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale," said one of Stu Rotenberg's news sites, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and it’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among the undecided women from the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Prior to Ford's public statement, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans had decided to approve the candidate, it might have been violent.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," said Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, former President of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how they treated Ford," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more support from the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent found that they believed Kavanaugh's testimony strongly or rather.
In addition, 38% of respondents found that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake’s pressure, the FBI began investigating Ford’s charges, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that he was nominated for the Supreme Court and showed her his genitalia during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web network, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on an open source platform — Solid — belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and what persons have access to specific information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt is to "dominated over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "web shop with personal data" or otherwise POD.

Bernard Vann: Marking the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which during World War I as a combatants was celebrated by the Cross of Victoria, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was celebrated on September 29, 1918 for his attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never finding out that he was decorated with the highest British military order.
On Saturday his two grandkids opened a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone exactly on the hundredth anniversary of his grandfather’s celebration was “extremely symbolic. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire from the field and machine guns.”
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with “the greatest courage” led her forward, after which he alone attacked the position of the field division, destroying three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I could never cope with, but at the same time humble. ”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath after the end of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people".
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got Pig Peppa.
Imagine if you hadn't slept all night to see the emotion-packed Bellator 206 gala and finally couldn't see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program contained 13 fights, including six on the main map, and was shown live at night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked by the change of program to Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping early in the morning especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in cartoons for children as "a sick joke".
"According to the government regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President for the marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Pig, yes."
The president of Bellator's organization, Scott Coker, said they'd be working on a schedule to take into account British viewers in the future.
"When I think about repeating the situation, I think we will be able to fix it," said Coker.
"But it is Sunday the sixth morning, so that we will not be able to cope with this until Sunday according to our time and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed there, we got a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — to a standard amount — and we too strongly wanted to satisfy the fans and unfortunately we got better.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs, Radio 4 conducted by Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this broadcast for many years, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of the disease.
As he appeared in Laverne’s first program, Dale said that as he grew up, he felt “less valuable” than others, because “the simultaneous likeness of boys and girls was not socially acceptable”.
He said: “To this day it is a sense of inferiority and being different that gives me the strength to succeed. ”
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “worthy ” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time brown Olympic medalist became the loudest actor in the LGBT community and used his performance at this year's National Games in Australia to appeal to more countries for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and thus wanted to give others “hope. ”
Three times the world’s champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised him. ”
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14, and the death of your father because of cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple stayed in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said that his perception of certain things had changed completely.
"Last year, the most important thing for me was to get a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than the golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't be with us to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died did I understand that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and got brown.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water before the crowd at the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — The Power of Heather Small — that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and that still turns him into a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing the absence of Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form so that she doesn't print her mark.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a two-year event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's four-ball and four-some games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often happened in his case with the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day doping the team and working to improve his game in hopes of correcting the reason for his referral to the bench.
A 48-year-old who has never given the simplest punches, even at the peak of his career, is not doing very well in the tight field of Le Golf National, on which the wrong blows are unrelentingly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match he must face the precision of the winner of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with a series, Mickelson's match can be extremely crucial.
Furik expressed his confidence in his opponent — he was more than willing to do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, held my hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very confident of himself.
He is in the gallery of fame and has brought many of his teams into play both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it happened, and that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everybody else."
Mickelson's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson's score is 18 wins, 20 loses, and seven drawbacks.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, funny, mockery, and it’s good to have it in the team’s room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings more than just a game to his person."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that a large point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting singles on the last day Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
In 1997, the Danish debuted in the Valderram field, where, along with his fellow deputy, Sev Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the line of targets passed by with the shortest possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget that we had a great advantage in the Valderram field; we also had a great advantage in the Brooklyn field, where we lost, and in the Valderram field we only won by hair," Bjorn said, in the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, which led 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It won't end until the points appear on the board.
We have a goal of winning the trophy, and we need to focus on that.
From the beginning, I said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who people are on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn, thrilled by the way his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done better.
But tomorrow it's different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It's good to play with your partner when everything comes to mind, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit of opportunity.
It's a message that needs to be passed on to the players, and it's tomorrow that we give it our best shot.
The partner also has to do his best."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results on their own than when playing with their partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced great returns on the last day as a member of the winning team in the Brooklyn field, after which he failed after the European team had performed a "miracle in the Medinah field".
"I remember every word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
"We are playing 12 important games in the morning – you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the fields of Brooklyn and Medinah.
If that drive goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We set up our warehouse accordingly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with counterattacking, facing Rory McIllroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the leading half of the programme.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he will manage the whole game," Bjorn said about his single election.
New German warship again delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put to use in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to defective arrangements and rising at an alarming rate — as local media reported.
The use of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, was moved to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the warship in 2014, but changes to this ambitious project were needed as a result of the problems that arose after delivery.
Four units of Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing frigates of the Bremen class.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance – the operation of new frigates should be possible for up to two years from the mother ports.
However, continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to react to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspapers last year, when a German Navy officially refused to commit the ship to operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported a number of key “software and equipment failures” that made the ship useless in the combat mission.
The software failures were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the size of the older Bremen class frigate.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and limits the possibility of future modernisation by the Navy.
It is believed that the weighing 7000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering level of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was worth EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the German naval fleet is shrinking.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the marines "are running out of ships capable of use".
He also said that the problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from service of the old units without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction at the fact that none of the frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research carried out on the property in the Scottish Highlands is intended to show how bats use the landscape in their acquisition of food.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and to help guide future efforts to protect them.
Research conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will cover common and small dwarfs, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the estate, special registrs will be deployed to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct field studies using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the way the species behave.
A map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the gardens and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can flies and some chemicals used in construction materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of the nighttime habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use complex echolocation techniques to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct tests, checks and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization founded even the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland on the territory of Three in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
But there are still many unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of control in terms of the presence of bats before entering into maintenance work in holdings, as the unintentional destruction of one barn can kill up to 400 females and young people, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing, harassing, and destroying their dignity is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while his lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described his allegations of rape as “fake news, ” saying that people“ want to promote ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
A Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's report, Der Spiegel's football player was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the charges were announced, identified these reports as "fake news" in an Instagram live feed to his 142 million followers.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is fake news," the five-time gold ball winner said.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I am happy and everything is fine," added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that they have called "unacceptable reporting of private suspicions" — says Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for “moral harm in the amount of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It was said to take place in June 2009 in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped an anal woman — according to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after an alleged entry and told her that “99 percent is a good guy ” who was visited by this “one percent. ”
According to Ronaldo's records, the couple had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital, but then she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "was afraid of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says she wants to invalidate the settlement now because she still can't forget the alleged procedure.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for it.
Brexit: United Kingdom “will always regret” the departure of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret this all the time" if, after leaving the European Union, it lost its status as a world leader in car production, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "worried" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need agreements," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Burnaston, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then there will be a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, the BMW is going to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as car manufacturers claim, the risks posed by the supply chain in the event of the European Union leaving the UK without an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU in the case of cars manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
As a representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than a day without supplies to its factory in Derbyshire, so production would be stopped.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
“We need agreements. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy our current success but also to make the most of this situation,” said BBC Radio 4.
"The statements not only of Toyota, but also of other producers show that we must be able to continue what consisted of a very efficient supply chain set."
Toyota was unable to determine how long production would be suspended, but cautioned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the plant in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the board of directors of the union organization Unite, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
The Ombudsman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, as the White House says.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "scheduled for another week" due to the ongoing fight for the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, according to the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who explores the possibility of Russian interference in the elections, the links between the close colleagues of Trump and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were about to go to the mosque.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he'd prefer not to fire Rosenstein, and there was an appointment to avoid colliding with the Senate Judicial Commission, during which Kavanaugh's testimony was filed and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI weekly investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it can take place this week, and it can be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll tell the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The program manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not due to the reluctance of "ostentious" TV journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentative".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President is holding more "questions and answers" than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We are familiar with the numbers".
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists are able to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and over the past few weeks we have done this very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which we will be able to speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Salt press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the journalists gathered.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union working in the Scottish health service to express his gratitude to them from the country and to ask them not to go after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of processing applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “This summer negotiations continued on Britain’s exit from the European Union, and the relevant decisions will be taken this autumn.
The British government has also intensified preparations for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes head trauma surgery
The senior Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, underwent a head trauma operation in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with the defeat of the Tennessee team with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player suffered a trauma shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the sideline, after which he leaned to the ground," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed it on the stretcher and carried it out for further testing.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/size of the injury”, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (second-year student released from university representation for a year to train her skills) plays her first season in the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the game ended, he had five games, which gives him 18 games throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
In accordance with the new plans for foreign buyers, higher fees will be charged for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom. This will be the way the funds will be allocated to the homeless.
This move is intended to bring about the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The increase in fees will include those who do not tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that it will receive as much as £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will now inform foreigners who purchase property in the United Kingdom that a higher fee will be charged, and the additional funds thus obtained will be allocated to the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to defuse Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper apartments and to increase the burden of more earners.
Higher fees will be paid by individuals and non-tax companies in the UK, and additional measures will help the government fight homelessness.
The additional charge — charged in addition to the current tax, including the higher rates imposed two years ago for second homes and rental apartments — may be up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects that this move will lead to up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and the difficulty of buying the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time abroad, many rich regions — especially the capital — have become “spirit cities. ”
The new rules only come in a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in the fees that would help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the land, but not exploiting it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the low-cost housing limits in order to eliminate the "housing scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the "no reason" show.
It also wants to give local authorities more power to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as a prime minister, I would be involved in rebuilding the British dream that every generation’s life would be better than the previous one.
This also means repairing our troubled housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
It is not right, however, that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy property here, which is hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become very distant, and humiliation associated with the need to stay on the streets remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become Scotland's selector"
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to be a selector of Scotland at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scot is working to heal the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stage of Light this summer after he introduced the St Mirren Club back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only managed to get to B's staff," Ross said in an interview for BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched the Scottish match with my father in Hampton and I was always drawn to it.
However, this option will only come if I succeed as a club coach."
Among Ross' predecessors were coach Sunderland, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he does not feel discouraged, taking over the role of such celebrities in such a large club, rejecting earlier proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At present, success will be measured for me by whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
In view of its structure and the facilities it has, it is undoubtedly his place there," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have succeeded here only if I succeed."
Rossa’s coaching career lasted only three years. Before that he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months he was a member of the coach team Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa re-energize after his third league degradation, and in the following season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the fall to the championship title.
Jack Ross claims to be feeling much more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real turning point" – this is what Coach Allo's position refers to.
"I really believed that running a team was much better for me than playing.
That would sound strange, because as a player, I managed, made good money, and achieved some measurable successes.
But playing is a hard piece of bread.
Every week, you have to go through all kinds of situations.
They still meet me about the stress and pressure associated with the coach's work, but I feel good about it.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can say that I feel the most at this point in my entire adult life."

Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a violent influx of customers into the British pubs, but it hit the restaurant's network with a hammer.
Studies showed that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting company, who developed the data, says: “A steady heat and longer than expected the participation of England in the World Cup resulted in the results of July being similar to that of June, when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even more.
In June, the 1.8% drop in sales in restaurants in July increased even more.
Offering pubs and bars did their best — their sales growth exceeded the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered from inflammation, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and the food fell by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman of the RSM company involved in the analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry says: “These results have been recorded in the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the volume of consumption 'outside the house' remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the decline in sales by 4.8% compared to the previous year will have particularly profound consequences, given the constant pressure on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has arrived at the least favourable moment for the owners of food-serving restaurants, and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary breathing."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds. It sets recognised industry standards.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Research has shown that one in five children — some only 11 years old — have secret social networking accounts that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of pages of "fake Insta"
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is published on them
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children — some only 11 years of age — set up social networking accounts that he does not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where photos can be shared.
This news has fueled fears that these accounts are used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students admitted to keeping a well - mannered “main account ” that they show their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers, who happened to run into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who urged others to "rape her".
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters Association" and Headmittresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom are admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC’s president, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of the management of the Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as the non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most famous Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are confident that introducing her to the board of directors will bring great benefits to the Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy to be able to convey to the board the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help manage sports in Scotland.”
An American who, among his four gold Olympic medals, has won 200 and 400 metres at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly plays in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischaemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show whether I would regain efficiency and to what extent.
It was a hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
The advertising of lactators, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactator company caused a storm on the Internet, publishing an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
In order to announce the introduction into the market of "the world's first silent lactator to wear under clothing", his producer, Elvie, published a mock-up commercial in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it gives to mothers.
She presents four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled choir to a song that says, "Yes, I'm breast-feeding, but I can't see the tail" and "If you don't see it, it's not just my tits."
And the chorus goes, "Pick 'em up, pump 'em up, feed 'em, pump 'em, pump 'em, suck 'em up, milk 'em."
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused considerable controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them say that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that occurs in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, with their children being taken away from them after a few days of birth," wrote one user.
Elvie’s lactator can be worn undetected under the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It’s obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can stop their children."
Someone else added: “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
The other weapons the video — one of the women said that she thought the song was “fun. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was drawing food.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second day in it.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a funny commercial directed at mothers who take food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film it turns out that women danced with lactators attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s lactator is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn undetected under the bra for feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, to hold children on their hands, and even to leave the house while drawing food.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother’s company, said: “Elvie’s Lactator is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative prime minister.
By bringing together nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges involved in the withdrawal of food, while presenting in a funny and consistent way the amazing sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator hit the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children with the product attached appeared on the show Marty Jakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is increasing rapidly, although the number of persons who are crossing the border does not change properly every month. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who fear deportation exposure if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the common farm would receive fingerprints which would then be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had volunteered to sponsor children left without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had not been recorded before.
"Almost 80 per cent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal background.
That's why we're always chasing them," Albence said.
As part of efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was done in accordance with previous standards.
Much will be said through videoconference, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter staff and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders said that these problems are even more serious for larger centres like Tornillo, where because of its size it is easier to ignore the signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to a tent camp without giving them adequate time to prepare emotionally or say good-bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in Syria has lasted for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces reside illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem claims that “the war on terrorism has almost ended” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "lead its holy battle to the cleansing of Syrian territory" both from terrorist groups and from "any foreigner who is on it illegally".
Currently, there are about 2,000 US soldiers in Syria, who mainly train Kurdish forces and Syrians against President Bashar al-Assad and advise them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country that have been destroyed by war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he accused “some Western countries ” of“ stirring up irrational fear ” that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help with these returns," he said.
"They policy matters which should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad enters into a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will receive no aid for reconstruction.
UN diplomats say that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major Syrian attack supported by Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "expressive time frame", and expressed the hope that the military action would be targeted at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida-related Levant People's Defence Front, who would be "exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new commission composed of members of the ruling and opposition to draw up a draft postwar constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "to verifying the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wins The Elections Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020, unless, as he hopes, many liberal observers, his presidency ends earlier by removing itself from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far".
So far, there's no sign of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, the CNN channel has doubled to 1.05 million viewers and the MSNBC channel has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers are attracted in the hours of the highest viewers, which is an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" programme, broadcast in the MSNBC channel, has achieved the highest performance among cable televisions, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers in the evening news programmes.
“People fly like the clouds of fire — that’s something we don’t understand” said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s “Designed Survival” series on the secretary of the cabinet, who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy artist and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She mentions how she took a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has an entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, determine the future of Roe v. Wade's case, the admissibility of the merger of immigrant families or the state of the world's economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch the panel of experts debated using Bob Woodward's secret informants when writing the book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's jacket from the skin of an ostrich for $15,000 (“puffed clothes” as described by The Washington Post) or the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
“What he does partly reminds him of the reality of the show in that every evening he delivers new content”, said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, of the changing siege and daily returns of Trump’s action (as an attack on NFL’s players or the praise of Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're gonna be late.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where he owns his house, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judicial Commission and weighed on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'it's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The flow of money from outside to the electoral campaign to Congress
No wonder that after reorganizing the constituency, which results in the race for one position being the status of the two congressmen now serving, there is a river of cash flowing to the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania.
This newly established suburban district of Pittsburgh represents a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus representing the former 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely covers the new 17th district.
The county maps were corrected following the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts had been unfairly appointed, giving precedence to the Republicans and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district of 17 began with the fight to finance the campaign between the main party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning the hair in the widely commented election to the 18th constituency, which took place in March.
For over a decade, the Republican has been in this position, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts have given Democrats a small advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but has withdrawn from this idea.
The diplomats noticed that Dominicana and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite a slight opposition to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump met cordially with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella, and until the removal of the team's partners, the Trump Organization had a hotel in Panama.
Officials of the Department of State have decided to call off the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominicana and Panama because of “the recent decisions to stop the recognition of Taiwan”, as Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in her statement this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017 to help fight drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very touching for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed the conference at a high level, which was to deal with security and economic well-being in order to address the conclusions of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from joining the United States.
In mid-September, officials at the highest level made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus reducing any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that the conference currently scheduled for mid-October is to be attended by Vice-President Mike Pence, which is intended to signal the invitation to the meeting of representatives of the administration.
Three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominicans, without any new harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton's spokesman for the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal perceptions on the condition of anonymity.
Their relationship was confirmed by an external analyst from the administration environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element could be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, to which there is now concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If the composition of the Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable when he prepares to re-approach the voters and may even be tried before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide how long this may take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable origin of democracy.
There are now several such turning points in front of the Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump releases Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's been in trouble ever since we found out in our paper that last year he proposed a secret video of the president and speculated that he wasn't fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the relation presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court judge despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
First of all, will we, in the middle of the presidential term, elect those who will bring Donald Trump to justice?
If we don't go through these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light sabbatical candles on that table with a swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how could I not look into the future optimistically?"

Winner of the Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, optimistically waiting for a match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that winning the Austrians after an impressive release from Villareal this month in Spain will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the G League of Europe.
Until the draw 2:2 from Villareal knee injury prevented Assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will affect the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"We did well because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-olds.
“We went to this game with the belief that we will achieve something — and we won the point.
Perhaps at the end of the day we could still push them, but in general the draw is probably a just result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can score three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent won a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will get through and this and we will win a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult because of all the injuries and changes in the club itself, but now we're all feeling good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings spends women's sleep from the ages
Although those involved in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to deal with them, few talked to their family about it.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said that they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
Where do you want to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to care for you unless you express your will beforehand.
With your counselor and family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, since this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask the financial advisor for help: He may help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses or from your own property — if any.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent you from going to court.
Designate a trusted healthcare officer who will supervise and ensure that the persons concerned act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of a financial officer.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your parent needs medical attention at an old age and is about to go to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?

A man shot repeatedly with an Ilfracombe windshield
The man was repeatedly shot from the windshield as he returned home from the evening party.
Forty cells were located near Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe County, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The officers identified the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m. BST, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
These injuries do not endanger a man's life.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Because of the broken communication, rescue workers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal kabuten, located north of Palo, near the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
Over 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the town of Palu and Dongala's kabupitation on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. It is estimated that 379,800 people lived in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, it was the 40th anniversary of its establishment that lasted in the city.
Donggala is a kabupaten (a administrative unit below the provincial level) stretching along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main sectors of the Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed particularly in the coastal capital of Donggal.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Management, during the last 100 years of the earthquake and tsunami, Palu and Donggala have been visited several times.
In 1938, tsunamis that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located on an active seismic Pacific ring of fire, causing earthquakes there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that visited the western coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of severe earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, there was a 6.8-degree earthquake, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 - degree earthquake took place near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 - degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's kabupathen in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but the falling buildings killed over 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They destroyed thousands of homes and caused temporary trouble for thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is under arrest for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested under assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, originating in Vasila, Alaska, 29-year-olds were arrested for domestic violence, obstructing reporting and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
KTUU reports that Palin is in custody in Mat-Su and has a $500 bail.
According to her information, he was brought before a court last Saturday, where he stated in his defense speech that he was “certainly innocent. ”
There are three Class A offenses on the Palina, which means he can get a sentence of as much as a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He was also charged with an offence of Class B, for which a fine of $2,000 is in prison and fines.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
That's when his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Court of Appeal of Veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, making it difficult to file a report and possession of weapons in a state of incoherence in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, teams of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the trauma team he acquired while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of tsunamis following an earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of Friday’s earthquake that visited the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not functioning and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, located northeast of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media, there are movies showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival took place.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov's suspected terrorist attack in New York City, which has resulted in the death of eight people.
To carry out the attack that took place in October on a bicycle path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented truck called Home Depot, which was driven by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to the announcement made in the Southern District of New York of the intention to demand a death penalty in order to justify its need, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "targeted" killed eight victims and "targeted" caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court document, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 items, including eight counts of murder in illegal activity — a procedure usually applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases — and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack called for "solid planning and reflection".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnicca”, notes the announcement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine citizens who were in New York City on tourism.
The last time a death penalty was imposed in the southern district of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the sentence of life.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's legal documents, which came from Uzbekistan, he did not show remorse in the months following the attack.
The police say he told the investigators he was feeling good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that ISIS films that he was watching on the phone inspired him to attack.
According to the police, he also demanded the suspension of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
An indictment involving 22 charges is based on his innocence.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said that they were “disappointed for obvious reasons” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after admitting guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all the persons concerned," he said.
Saipova's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
Parliamentarian for Toris says that Nigel Farage should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest during the Toris Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Deputised on behalf of conservatives, Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage were Secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, the inclusion of the tracks in the community in a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further highlighted the difficulty of reconciling its deeply divided ranks, which Theresa May faces.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement his plan of compromise with the Chequers among the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite her objections, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "screw the plan from Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did, we would be out of the Union now," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “That is not why we fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to be our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens changed their opinion on the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is entirely false.”
There was also a demonstration of support for Brexit Andrea Jenkins from a party of thorists, who told reporters: “I am just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists, who inhabit the streets and who chose us, do not support it either.
Leave the plan with the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: “Premiers maintain their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Nigel Farage said that politicians participating in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say 'we won't let you do it'."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of being betrayed by Brexit feel warm.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved "Torys v. Brexit" banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis laughed at conservatives for the security problems of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who claim to be able to organise IT systems and all the technology to support the plan Canada plus, the liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "consider seriously" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will seriously consider running for president".
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held on Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November. She will be opposed by a Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 elections.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning on running for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government — and she also means a woman on the very top. ”
Arresting a mortal gunman who killed a LSU player, Wayde Sims
Police from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in a Friday shooting where a LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims, died.
Police Department in Baton Rouge reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern time.
On Friday, a recording of the shooting was released asking for help identifying the man visible on it.
20-year-old Wade Sims died as a result of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot with a gun to the head, which led to his death,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul in 247sports.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun and shooting at Wade.
After the arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The measuring 1.98 m junior Wade Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games, and in the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 games.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would have a major impact on the result of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel came down to the service station first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the tail of the peleton, which should decide the fates of the race.
The Mercedes competitor went down to the boxing in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after a round in a circle, as a result of which Ferrari's driver reluctantly left the interior of the track, risking pushing for a double-movement defense rival to defend the position on the third corner, Hamilton took the lead.
Max Verstappen started off at the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in seventh place.
Then, through a large part of the race, he did not change tires to perform a quick finish and take over Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the other eight laps, he failed to speed up.
"It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team did its best to take two first places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump yelled at Senator Diana Feinstein, who held that she had not disclosed the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the statements lodged by Christina Ford before the Senate Justice Commission. Instead, he said that what happened in the Senate had proved that people were "subtle, wicked and lying".
"What may have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for several days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, mean, angry and lying," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they say to us, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of that document? — Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't reveal" – he added, cutting off the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his content ran out in early September.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s innuendo, I didn’t tell her the story,” Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion and, as she asked, I did not disclose these contents."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on them this way at a Saturday meeting: “I tell you, it was a really bad speech of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused him of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats were using their own insinuations.
"They are determined to take power by all means.
You can see meanness, malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite news.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee Patrick Dwyer won two goals for the Giants
The Dundee Stars Club retaliated its Friday losing league with the Belfast Giants, winning a five-to-three retaliatory game on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-door advantage after the shots fired by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney leveled the score, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard re-balanced the score by winning the Dundee goal, after which two gates shot by Lucas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for the guardian Adam Keefe, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won the Dundee team in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met this season for the fourth time — three first matches won by the Giants.
The opening goal of Dwyer fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaulla's assistant. Four minutes later Beauvilleer doubled his score thanks to David Rutherford's assistant.
After intensive opening at 13:10 a minute Sullivan introduced the host team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt leveled the score at 15:16.
Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage of the first break when he won his second goal at the end of the first stage that night.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard again leveled the score with the score gained during the game in advantage of 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second stage Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen provide Dundee team with the first advantage in the match. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in half of the last stage by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost their last five games of four next match will play Friday at their home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller is dying, helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was yelled at by a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people aboard.
More than 800 people died, and many were found missing after a major earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area, and in Palu, many people are trapped in ruins.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the scattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Yufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air flight (fly 6321), which was just on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to fall.
He died in a hospital.
According to reports from the Australian ABC News Station, Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said that the control decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This message has broken our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of fatalities may reach thousands. The National Disaster Management Agency reports that the possibility of reaching the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase because many bodies are still in ruins and cannot be reached," said the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Six - foot - long [6 m] tsunamis destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News Station: “Ambulances constantly bring bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are ploughed."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, and it could be worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived in Pal, who called on the army: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on Lombok Island.
The crash of a plane in Micronesia — Air Niugini reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon
Airplanes operating a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific report that one person is missing. They previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to the data for Saturday afternoon, one man could not count who was traveling on a feral plane.
They made sure that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find him.
However, they did not provide an immediate response to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airline said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It is not clear what caused the disaster, nor is its exact course.
Airline and U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
"This has helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said he managed to get other people through the lane to get out of the emergency sinking plane.
According to him, members of the crew panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy also reported that marines who were working nearby to modernize the coast were able to transport people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 metres deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea. However, there is no Air Niugini among these lines.
Analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to the judges how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the route of a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on a feral night.
When the data confirmed that at the time that Quinton was supposed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
Asked by the prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that he "had lied because my truck was in Nashville at the time".
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he'd known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details, as well as texts and calls.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The final defense speech is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it was likely that on the same day the case would be handed over to the jury.
The High Breed — What Is Aware of hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the species, filling its music with a positive message.
According to the group The High Breed of Bristol, today's hip-hop has gone away from the original political content and social issues.
The team members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of a conscious hip-hop.
The work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey has recently seen the rebirth of artists like The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom.
Another black?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for a "racist" text release
A New York nanny sues a couple for her dismissal from a racist job after receiving a misaddressed text in which a child's mother complains that she is "another black person".
The couple deny that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to “sacrifice. ”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly contrasted when it turned out that the new guardian, Giselle Maurice, who placed herself on the first day of work in 2016, was black.
“ NO, COLONEL BLACK PERSON” she wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had made a mistake, Gisella Maurice was “crushed, ” claiming that a loving nanny, who is African American, was doing her duties badly, and she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for her day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
Now she's demanding a couple of compensations for the $350 a day, multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed with a residence, even though she didn't sign the contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," the Post said Friday and added "I know this is discrimination".
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, claiming that ending their cooperation with Mrs. Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco, Post husband.
"Would you entrust your children to the person you have caused grief, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to "sacrifice", Plasco said that his wife had only been born two months earlier and had been in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blow something like this up?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public opinion has quickly issued a judgment in the social media, criticizing it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s books feared that readers would feel no connection to the talking mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says of the letter: “It’s hard to stand on the spot of the person who first read it before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She claims that her father, who, before the little plush bear inspired him to write a book for the children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was certain that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book appeared to be "sweet and bitter".
Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family, ” says that her father was in secret proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t flatter himself,” he adds.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it’s not your fault.
I think Paddington's success was seen in something like this.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After landing her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn't come out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes and I have to say good-bye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that her doctors gave her to keep her heart beat slowly stopped working and were removed from her system.
She died a while earlier, and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit around and wait for it to develop.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry because I was one of the other people.
I really had to stick with it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the suffering she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt overwhelming sympathy for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Pants from women in mourning to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put Welsh postcards on the bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he got depressed.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a well-predicted cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could clear up every room with it."
Before he died, however, he gave up his job because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old, and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and that you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be quiet - talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years shortly after her mother died.
"Nothing said he felt beaten, sad or anything," he says.
"For a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was already in a full hole at Christmas, when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It’s tearing a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI is launching an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — a limited-time and limited-scale investigation — maybe we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the commission was "disintegrating" into opposite camps, which led to an impassionation.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their unwillingness comes from a moment.
The election to Congress is in a few weeks — November 6 — and if the Republicans are expected to lose it, the chances of electing a certain person to the highest court in the country will decrease significantly.
George W. Bush had already picked up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes from the senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the momentum and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of North Korean fugitives is declining.
According to South Korean legislator Kim Jongun took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to the South fell.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1,127 escapes last year and in 2011 there were 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates collected by human smugglers.
Pjongjang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally proposed South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border has illegally exceeded more than 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back to the country by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on the denuclearisation negotiations, which had previously been at a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of President Donald Trump of the United States, with Kim Dzong Un, which took place in June in Singapore.
On Saturday, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and in these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves as the first one," Ri said in a speech he gave to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrick" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "histrick" and said that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman behaved like this, she would be considered a 'histress'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate of Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual abuse by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost shouting and losing his speech when discussing family issues and high school issues.
He also explicitly persecuted the Democrats from the commission, identifying the charges against him “grotesque and coordinated assassination of reputation” organised by the Liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to recall Kavanaugh from office if he had been nominated and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also take office in this court where he currently works," she said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears the possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, he avoided questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person to court who will expect us to say 'but it is wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to rule it.
It's a proper diet, months and years of spilling furry, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"That's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was the manager of a company. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she made up such a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she talks to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most distinct memories of one of the first jobs in a male - dominated office is how I once began to cry with unspeakable rage.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they made you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a boat lover named Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, she was frustrated with Patricia's borders that she could actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
"It was not a deliberate decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"The elections were already run by seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone named this situation "The Snow Queen and the Seven Beautiful Men."
Since the campaign lasted for a long time, Schroeder was behind on fundraising and promised not to join the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to defeat.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, only had 250 dollars for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During her talk of not campaigning, she was so filled with emotion — gratitude for those who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism — that her voice was tied to her throat.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown," the press said.
"You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"Was she crying?"
What can be the benefits to Beijing of the economic war between the United States and China?
The saloons starting the economic war between the United States and China were stunning, and while the battle is still ongoing, in the long run the conflict between these countries may be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
The first warning this year was launched by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing reciprocates in nature, raising its taxes on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike and does not seem to have a second world economy to give up soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for President Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the US trade war could in the long run strengthen China, reducing the dependency between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for unleashing economic chaos in one of the countries is in fact far more dangerous than the observers have previously granted” said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is "ready" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding the country destroyed as a result of over seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure because of progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic developments aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens since the start of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid covered by the conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has already lost six in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup Cup Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it won 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was not doing well during most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base straight to the water at the 16th pit of PAR3, thus giving Francesca Molinari a match.
Italian golfer Molinari sparkled through all the rounds and became one of four players, who since 1979, when this tournament took place for the first time in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes in front of the last hole with Englishman Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the largest number of victories in Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who had already participated in eight of these tournaments and won 25.5 points of career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
This is the success of the whole team and I am glad that I could help," said the moved Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He's handing over the bat to his cousin, John Rahm, who won a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, on Sunday, with a score of 2–1.
“I feel incredible pride in winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the games in France and now he has the results 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's an unusual statistic, like one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles and only gave up on Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems finding a track all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American composition, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pushed some Europeans.
We've retreated.
Head hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
