Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law establishing administrative responsibility for violations of the terms and conditions of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal purposes.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of failing to meet its obligations to the contracting authorities in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs were unable to obtain payment under existing public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia commissioned the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to take the issue for special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not deal with unconscionable customers who had entered into unfunded contracts, tried to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic as a whole in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been made to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs, as a result of which 4.5 thousand officials have been involved in disciplinary proceedings, 533 administrative officials have been brought to the Investigative Offices for the purpose of conducting the examinations, and 46 criminal cases have been brought.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts, however, were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have resulted in more modest amounts.
Here's a typical case.
The manager of a small company won a multi-million roubles competition for social services.
The man had invested all his negotiable funds, had fully fulfilled his obligations, but had not received the money in time.
The result is an increasing financial sum of wages, taxes, loans that would result in bankruptcy if the business did not seek assistance from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The problem has now been eliminated as far as possible in a number of regions.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total debt of public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation entities was approximately 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt ratios continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates in manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally conducts visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all violations revealed by prosecutors are thoroughly addressed and immediate remedial measures are taken.
Such operational meetings have already taken place in Jaroslav and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ on Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences on Administrative Offences for the Establishment of Administrative Liability of Customer Officials for Violations of the Time and Procedure for the Payment of Goods (Working, Services) in Procurement for Public and Municipal Needs, signed last week by the President of Russia, will improve the payment discipline of public clients.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Henprocuratorate.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for violation by the official of the employer of the time and manner in which goods, works and services are paid in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been sentenced to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative novels are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Unit has announced a warning on the movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population has issued a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: “Prevention for Travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful Population, valid until 28 August 2017, calls upon African-American Travellers, Guests and Citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise greater caution when travelling through the state in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on racist grounds that have recently taken place throughout the state and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful Population, the group has recently promulgated a law in Missouri that has made it more difficult for people to win discrimination-related claims and that state law enforcement agencies often choose their minority targets disproportionately.
“You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the colour of their skin, they are beaten and killed," said the Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colorful Population of Missouri.
“We hear complaints often more than ever.”
This is the first warning that the organization has declared against the US state.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black male from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on a state trip, and the Missouri State police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the State Attorney General ' s Office of Missouri that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The purpose of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money for collateral or inform their relatives that they are travelling through state territory.”
According to the latest FBI report on hate crimes, 100 hate crimes have been reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state 16th in the State in the number of such violations.
A movement warning is also a response to the new State of Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms (ACLU) had announced warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after the new immigration control laws had been passed by those states, under which local law enforcement authorities had been ordered to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, should have increased the number of racially motivated checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of gunfire on a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reported with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three injured.
All wounded are taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car and then two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the conspiracies was detained, the other managed to hide.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free luggage for non-refundable airfare
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Saphonov, said in an interview with the TV channel RBC that “positively” refers to the adoption of a law on the abolition of free luggage transport in non-refundable airfare.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the person who has luggage," he stressed (TASS quotation).
At the same time, Mr. Saphonov noted that despite the fears of the citizens, there would be no need to pay for the transportation of clothing and mobile phones in the handhold.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say that it is up to top clothes, to umbrellas, to mobile phones, to the iPad or even to some computer that has no connection," said the head of Rosturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the provision of free luggage for non-refundable airfare.
The point is that airlines can determine for themselves the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered the elimination of Baikal's pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that significant lake areas had been extremely polluted in recent years.
He commissioned the identification of sources of funding, plans and perpetrators for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned full recovery of the contaminated territories.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here that the clean-up facilities of most of them have been carried out,” RIA Novosti quoted the President as saying.
He also added that the Russian Attorney-General ' s Office should carry out a verification of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by the rest organizers.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything needs to be checked in a row, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities that need to be done here,” he stressed.
Earlier, the Office of the Attorney-General had reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of environmental surveillance facilities.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, on a direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed of problems in the management of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donska, immediately suggested that the problem should be addressed by clarifying the limits of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buryatiya, it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, since the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Mine Economics proposed to solve the problem by amending the Earth Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in Yugoslavia
In the village of Sosova, members of the community from the indigenous few peoples of the North, Rakhtinya, together with the inhabitants of the Berezov region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honour of the Saint Nikolai Wondermaker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen from afar, so it will serve as a lighthouse for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now in place, and church bell towers are available.
The IREF escorted the IREF.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miraclemaker because it is honored by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosyhua, fishing gives the settlers work and feed them.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it as a local landmark in school.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do laws apply in Singapore?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the cucumbers carefully store in an iron box that he takes away from his office.
After the interview, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, a hundred feet [100 m] before it, and throws the bulls there.
The garbage fine in a public place -- $500 local -- is reported by Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just developed a reflex: you can't throw a cotton candy on a bridge, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, when I was a kid, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I
And now there's cameras everywhere.
And indeed, the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are as clean as the museum.
Chang tells us that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to contempt.
What?
Imagine that.
He was struck ten times with a wooden stick and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of physical punishment.
As in Singapore, the highest standard of living and the most unbelievably strict laws are combined, an Aif observer was on the ground.
No one here intends to abolish the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long cared for the views of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person drives a large batch of drugs or trades them, he is given a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
It was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even Pope Roman.
But the guy ended up hanging out anyway.
After that, our drug addicts are making a hard drive around our country.
The point is this: Singapore states that laws are required to comply with the EfE in order, not only with modest and poor people.
No matter who you are, you're a millionaire, you're a deputy prime minister, you're a famous artist or you're a resident of the European Union.
The only option is, if you get a crack cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet alert dogs everywhere, you're surprised -- how many bans in this city!
For example, chewable rubber is sold only in pharmacies and can be purchased strictly by a doctor (!)
The tourist will not be deprived of his gum on arrival, but it is worth putting the rubber on the subway, putting in a fine of $1,000.
Four days later, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to the fine, cucumbers are often assigned to a “sport in the yard” for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6,000 rub. Pays the “criminal” who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need for an elevator at home, a special detector works, locks the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive floods of the room plant (!): it is believed that the water supply attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters on the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Anyway, the idea is, whatever you're trying to do, you're gonna break something.
That's not true, he's trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir-Kajariya, the owner of local tourism.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone drawn to them for their violation.
Why are they still there?
So that the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are followed closely.
Let's just say that if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, they'll be punished all over the chain: the store owner will pay a huge sum, the offender himself will get hit with a stick on the back, and the seller will also be put out and put in jail.
It is precisely because of such severe laws that the crime in Singapore is very rare.
Is that justified?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had chaos on the roads, and motorists ignored the traffic lights, driving like hotels, getting drunk and driving.
After the imposition of the fines of the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a serving of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police will not let go of the bribe, impose a fine of the cost of the apartment and will be sent to jail for years.
Many foreign nationals in South-East Asia appear to be in a variety of concentration camps.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "The Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a guest from the United States brought horror to the general public's wealth, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
It doesn't seem natural to do that kind of thing, it doesn't look like it's fake, and it shouldn't be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really scared to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you're gonna love it when you get on the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to Little India, and suddenly you're breaking the pattern, and there's plastic cups at the bus stop.
"How's that?" You're surprised.
Right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
Everything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you must know that if you are counted, you will not get away with it. You have violated the law.
Most of the time, it's enough for a person to act normal.
Of course, Singapore’s authority is authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam’s Hoshimina, I moved very carefully — motorcyclists often pick up smartphones and cameras from tourists.
In the center of Paris, there are dirty bogs and beggars.
In our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage into urns.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth, thanks to the recruitment of draconian fines and ruthless (until the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
That's human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one would stick to the wheel until they got fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, it is voluntary compliance with laws.
And we have to think that we have people in Russia who would like clean streets, no garbage on the subway, and they would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment. Thank you, don't.
In the rest, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking after.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
The Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - from here deliberately the theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a heated dispute with journalist CNN Jim Acosta about the President's proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
A handful of pleasureboat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynched him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, especially of the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller was saying to Acosta, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that exudes the world.
The contemplation you speak of has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller gave the facts right, but like he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: “Your tired, your poor, / your people who dream of taking a breath freely, /The unfortunate wastes of your abundant shores.”
Never before have the "unfortunate" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, he made it clear that in America, the Trumps weren't waiting for these people.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus — and her friends, who fought to put her words on a cap of statues after her death — knew very well that they were committing a purely political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the link between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the Mother of the Exile.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativity.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right is to change it back.
Thunderous Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptist who announced Trump's arrival in 2010, reasoned that freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservator carrying the flames of America in the darkness of the world: "Freedom is moving forward.
It brings a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the road to the United States."
Limbo's practice is really at stake here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of vision.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This means literally looking into the world with the eyes of those who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Its statue is in harmony with the words of hope and hospitality that they desire to hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed, not to illuminate the way, but to stir up hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Championship: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the United Kingdom.
Aylide Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the U.K.
Neil Blake, director of the British Light Athletics Federation, said that a 16-person Scottish team member at the World Cup would make a “significant contribution to the game of the team”.
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the London Championship, starting on Friday, 2017.
Blake believes that Scotland is “born of something special” and that the British Light Athletics Federation should take that into account.
"We know this and we try to understand it and we will support it while they have the potential," Blake said.
"I talked to the people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they've done has to be done.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: What they have done must work.
People on the street feel the same way.
I don't know why it happened, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and the Eilid Doyle team has chosen its captain.
"Ailid is modest.
Her captain's speech was excellent," Blake said.
"Many athletes, whether Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling pride and mood for victory.
The passion and sincere feelings that Ailid put in her were remarkable."
The owner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth champion, who will run 400 m from the world's fifth World Championship with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British Assembly are “believably”.
The previous record for the number of Scots at the world championship was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in mid-range running, beat five British and two European records last year.
She'll run for 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who's going to be in the 1500-meter race, is another Scottish man who needs to be paid attention: behind his back is a good season, where he won the British Contests and the Annual Contests.
Doyle remembers his first world champion, when besides her, Lee McConnell was the only Scottish on the team.
The team captain says that she is “unbelievably proud” that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the assembly, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The team captain is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"At last, I am very proud of all the Scots who have entered the assembly room.
This shows how much we have accomplished.
And they're all sitting at the track trying to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just pointed out that we were very lucky to host the World Cup home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the sick and take advantage of the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go out on his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere will be just great there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't go public unless you're ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "it is possible to take away the freedom of speech and us deaf and dumb will lead like sheep to war."
Now I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and wiped the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties brought him to justice.
The subordinate governors called the claim null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "so and so."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He is second in favour of 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a strong hand in state management and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as his primary way of communicating with his constituents and shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking the people who come to the Governor ' s page - which is declared to be an official public forum and which is administered by the administration for taxpayers ' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking the comments was simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spams, and haters on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan had blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, contentious and not harsh.
The pastor quoted the Bible by appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Laxmi lawyer Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not hate but asked about hate crimes.
"I have written a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of his reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in a section of the comments to the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's a so-called tip instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "active life position".
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before when it has been necessary to send people, collect and burn critical newspapers or arrest and shut the mouth of protestors.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been confused on his Twitter account.
One of the first pivotal decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Kesheriz, the chairman of the Laudon County Monitoring Board violated the First Amendment by distracting the voters in her Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed claims against the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so difficult.
During the Washington era, affordable postal costs were about as disruptive as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and authors of anonymous letters severely undermined its authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the alias "Juricol", "Valerius", "Belarius" and "Portius" wrote letters in newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents collected by the George Washington documents online, his office has been challenged by petitions criticizing his position under the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Maritime Affairs.
But he wasn't trying to shut them up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lie at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means agreeing with it.
Ronan Rafferti looks forward to home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferti looks forward to home comforts for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Latvian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish Golf Tournament for older athletes.
A Northern Ireland national who led a neighborhood at the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, attached to a new place and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarwadi Club.
“I saw the Renaissance Club building, and we are watching it succeed with this event,” Rafferti said.
"The players will see this field at its best, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He is a keenly committed player and proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to winning the championship for the first time, despite winning his 32-year career both in the European Tournament and in the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said a player from Southport.
“I couldn’t try to win the “Extremadura Open” again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magical to return to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
He returns to the battle on Gary Orr's home land, which joined the European Senior Sports Tournament after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
“When you play home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said a resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to do well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I am pleased with the way things are going so far."
The Trio will be joined by former winners of the Masters Ian Wusnem tournament and major champions for older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrans are two of the six Scotsmen in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmoire and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free, and the parking lot costs £5 an hour if one person is in the car, and £10 if the person is two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Customary tunnels over highways capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on British roads.
The country ' s transport agency, according to the Autocar edition, reported positive results of a 100-metre tunnel test installed on one of the roads in the north.
A 6-metre-high tunnel is made up of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial transport on electric power lines and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all atmospheric pollution is caused by transport and poor air quality is caused by up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled to a fine.
Moshorsud changed the sentence of an disabled person named Anton Mamaev, sentenced to a fine of Rs 200,000 for four and a half years.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the Prosecutor's Office had asked the court to replace the probation period by explaining its request that Mamaev's illness “prohibited his being in prison”.
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment by serving a prison sentence in a colony of general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a visiting meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s “Golden Land”
Ready for lunch, Bardine Degey doesn't use the stove.
She doesn't even use a pot very much.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which is called a note, right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degey is sitting on the ground floor - she has no furniture - and this is where she does her work at home, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The maid serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
There's a lot of polygamy here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one chooses to walk in the village after five evenings,” she said.
It is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that joined Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement, in favour of independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which retains strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote a city as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jaiapura, the provincial administrative center, Nabire, and then a five-hour crash on a rental car.
There's no public transportation here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses with bamboo fences; the roofs of waffled steel are decorated with rust in a variety of shades of rice.
Few Indonesians came here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the pa·gos worshipped a god named Uga Tami.
There have been other changes.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes,” says Degey, pointing to his bright, woven handiwork, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to carry only leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population is below the poverty line and the levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, located in Phoenix, Freeport McMoran, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a high-rise province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport won gold and copper for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua may boast of forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, brings one calamity to the popes, guaranteeing that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local soldiers and units almost $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are relentlessly suppressed.
Human rights defenders have claimed that since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military forces and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the population of the indigenous highlanders of Papua during the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture, particularly in part, as stated in another report, rape and electrocution, and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because accidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, researching in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Straits have stalled, as Papuan resources have attracted the influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
3.5 million per cent of the province's population consists of Christians, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan barons, “warungi”, sell hot chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local residents are trying to withstand competition.
“The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua,” explains Abeth Yo, a twenty-four-year-old worker from Panama, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial administrative centre, because of work.
“As a result, the natives of Papua New Guinea, the mother (women) of Papua, lost their market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter was engaged with the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panama.
But little has changed in Papua New Guinea, and locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokov, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice,” says Jo.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration, Jokov Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas hymns at the Enarotali Kostra, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16 - year - old Julianus Amo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in the soccer field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunting bows and filled the watts, the dance of the Papuan tribe of Mee pago, running round and playing birds' singing.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation got worse, internal radio soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, he said, according to an official document that saw “TIME” correspondents, but which was not published in local media.
The 50 - year - old Jeremiah Kaiame, head of the Kego Koto area in Enarotali, felt danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to leave the house.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I returned, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist,” he told Time magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kaiame still doesn't know who shot, but he says the bullet came from the Shering of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
A local resident named Alfius Jowa had been shot three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, relates.
“I ran to him and examined his body to see if it was him,” said Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Jotje Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were merely protecting their base because it had been attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio of the Papua Police in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed, and much more were injured.
News of the murders only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi spoke in Jayapur, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua New Guinea.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to bring an end to the historical violations of human rights.
But the answers came almost immediately.
“The majority of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s or early zeros.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to be followed," he said.
Viranto then gave up his words by speaking with Time magazine in Jakarta on 5 June and said he was not planning to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “All things will be decided by judgment.”
Viranto, who was accused of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody vote for the independence of East Timor, said that 11 human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua, including the incident in Panama.
The families of the victims in Panama faced similar statements with dark mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but there have been absolutely no changes,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, afraid I'll get shot."
His brother Jacobus also felt that the inhabitants of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the soldiers came after me," he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at village residents in neighbouring Paniai District of Deiyai.
During the clashes between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, 20 - year - old Ravinus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of a construction site owned by a company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesia Specialnaz) started shooting at a crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation”, said 20-year-old Domingo Badia, who lived near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed.
"I've been hiding for two days at home."
The Deiyaj Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called for an answer and that the mobile police brigade withdraw from the region.
Paniai has always been a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development is due to the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the territory covered by the green central highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Movement for Free Papua (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by organizing sporadic attacks and attacks on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people in Panama have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Paniai is considered a “winning, forgotten place” among the population of Papua New Guinea.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The same degree of bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crops for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten club notes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in economic inequalities between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, which have come in large quantities since the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually given to more educated and meaningful migrants.
Papuas rarely have the money or skills needed to run their own competitive business.
“Young people do not want to stay in the village... because there is neither work nor money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escoudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate consistency with the organizations concerned” despite having been granted rare permits to conduct the video.
According to Felim Keene, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokov's election campaign to lift the restrictions on media work to promote transparency and development were not implemented.
“For the moment, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua face new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting in Panama.
The same countries have supported the OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, withdrew from the group's statement to journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia the democratic system is still in place and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Kis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke their silence, asking: “We want freedom”, according to the source, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokov again.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Panama," says Gobai, chairman of the tribe council.
He wants Jokov to know that the people of Paniai, except that they live in the shadow of the threat of the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobay says that the people of Panama, like other Papuans, consider their voice devoted to Jokov the debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Panama carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly across from the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice probably never triumphs, they will not at least allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus without lifting his head.
“What else were we supposed to do?”
The second time the fire covers the Dubai skyscraper, “Fakel”
The fire covered one of the world’s tallest living skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to leave their 70 - foot - high [337 m] construction in a hurry.
It's the second fire that's been going on in a tall building -- which is named "Fakel" by coincidence -- in two years.
The building was evacuated, human victims were not reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," said Reuters, a skyscraper called George.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defence Department, fire squads put out fires around 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on providing shelter to victims.
The incident may bring security issues to the attention of materials used in exteriors of tall buildings around the world.
An investigation by the torch administration there in 2015 revealed that the most affected posters were external panels used to form and isolate them.
In the United Kingdom, police stated that they believed that the isolation system and poster panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire that occurred there in June, resulting in the death of some 80 people.
Tourism growth in Ida Virumaa in June was minimal
According to data provided by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists were used by hotels in North-East, which is 125 or 0.6 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased and foreign tourists have grown.
For example, the foreign tour increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) to 7994 tourists in June.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The region's most marked increase in the number of Russian tourists was 8.9 per cent or 318, compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, only 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stopped at Ida Virumaa hotels.
Andrew Malachi made it clear to worshipers who were to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted at his fans at Instagram who were to blame for his departure from the First Channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a fragment of the News article of 1 August.
A photo of Malakhov signed "boss milk".
Article on how to prevent the “burning” of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
Remembering the numerous reports that the lead could not find a common language with a newly arrived producer who had begun to reform "Let them speak", it becomes clear what he had so transparently hinted at, he writes "CP".
TV host Andrei Malakhov was reportedly currently on leave and was not signing an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military vehicles were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, reported RIA Novosti.
According to the police, the night before, a mined vehicle exploded near the military blockade at Gishk's compound.
There are 20 dead people known to have been killed.
On Friday morning, a new P.P. took place in Gerishka.
Armed criminals attacked the exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver took a video of his shark camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal sealed it on a video shark that bit his walkie-talkie camera GoPro.
The role of the American Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, a staff member of Skomal, was posted on Facebook by Rolek.
The incident occurred on 2 August off the coast of Cape Cod in the north-east of the United States, according to the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera he was holding on a special stick during the underwater voyage.
After noticing the man, the animal reached him for more than three meters.
The shark tried to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator had done the same to determine whether he was dating.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this type of behavior of the marine animal was new to scientists.
There has been a known cause of mass fighting at the Ural military centre
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Allanian Training Centre, where there was a mass fighting to investigate the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to Mash, which appeared on the WContacte page, contractors in the Ural military section number 31612 fought violently because of an uninhabited bed.
It begins with the fact that a private named Sayan has demonstrated that he has ignored the officer's order to fill a shoving sheet.
The officers of the Sixth Company took the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men broke up beds and coffins in a barracks, knocked out glass.
More than ten people were injured in the fight.
In the CIVS, the information on the scissor was refuted.
The study showed that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited items into an airplane.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers were deliberately or accidentally carried on board the aircraft through the United States Administration of Transport Safety inspection posts, including at least 6 per cent of them were on board, unattended with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they were carrying firearms, ammunition or explosives by accident.
A study carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving more than 1,000 people also showed that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something prohibited by the ABB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the X-Genesis.
Conscientiously, ABB personnel are most likely to pass on food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that sharp objects had been carried through the examination and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents recognized that prohibited drugs had been deliberately taken into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled in through airport inspections and how much they had deliberately done so.
Most likely, knowingly or unconsciously, smuggle smugglers through surveillance.
According to the company, the ATS rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much they can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ABB chooses are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ABB might consider it illegal to move a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt rejects the intention to delay the implementation of the Obama emission reduction rules
On the day following the 15-state action, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama ' s rules to reduce emissions of substances that pollute air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now listening more than in previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around 1 October, to which the states should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid “inadequate local solutions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before being appointed by President Trump to his current post, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent opponent in the tightening of environmental norms.
Following his move to Washington, Pruitt, he had repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of regulations that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industries.
An unexpected change in course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of Piott's return to previous norms.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority to delay the Obama Administration ' s rule that oil and gas companies should monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by abruptly changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the responsibility of EPA to cooperate with the States in an integrated process of timely implementation of new standards.
“In previous administrations, EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines set, then waited for requests from groups of activists and others and discussed the timing of the settlement of the case”, said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous post.
“We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority it gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point re-use his “responsibility to defer and other legal powers” to ensure that the rules “ycyjdfys at a clear course and at all available information”.
The Republicans in Congress insist on a wider revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - after our actions - is an important victory in the fight for health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, directly affected by the ability to cover their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Mann, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the D.C.
Earth-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
This could cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It is sad to think how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person entrusted with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) Congress voted in favour of extending the elimination of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of WFL, which issued a report Monday recommending that the removal be maintained.
166 people voted in favour of the extension, 21 against TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Membership Council, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFL at the World Cup in London, Russian athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, which referred to numerous violations of the WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details on the latest report of the IAAF Board, see "U" in "IAAF has extended sanctions against WFLA".
Obsessive defeat
As part of the 3rd tour of the Russian Fonbeth Championship, the New Moscow-based Chemical team held a retreat match against the Kaluga FK.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played each other in a Russian cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The chemist did not give in to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and fiasco.
After the recent slaughter of the monks with the account 0:3 many had prophesied in advance the light victory of the masters.
Since the beginning of the meeting, however, the new Moscows have been forced to count themselves and act against the defence, but from the position of force.
In the 1st century, the monks built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another high-quality match was held by Alexei Orotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave his partners confidence in his actions.
Regrettably, the attack on "Chemiko" lacked the effort and the drive to put a dead end to the defense of "Kluga" and to hit the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to run at the rendezvous courses.
The New Moscowers played more actively in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team have been defense errors that have allowed the monks to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemical took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the monks' experience has played a role -- they've spent a lot more time in writing and cold blood, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemical transferred the ball to the corner, which had been transferred to the gate by the owner of the field without resistance.
Yuri Dubrovin was the author of the goal.
At the reporting meeting, Chemical showed a good game, but suffered an insult.
In front of our team, another exit is expected - on 11 August, at 19 hours in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium, Edouard Streltsov Novomoskovecs will face the favourite of the "Centre" FC Ararat, composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmajlov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support "Chemik!"
The meeting place and time of the Novomoskovecs - 6.30 p.m. near Magnolia Shop (East, d.o.b., basket).
Composition of "Chemika": Orotin, Manohin (k), Romashenko, Shayunov, Homutov, Goghija (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svetov, Belyanin (Adoevtsevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published phone transcripts, Trump was printing Mexico about the border wall.
The Washington Post published the decryption of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, during a telephone call with President Enrique Peña Nyeta Trump of Mexico, he insisted that he cease publicly to declare that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States scolded him for publicly speaking against the wall and said, according to leaked information, "You can't say this to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot rush in the published decryption.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees going to Australia was “funny”, “disgusting” and “stupid” and insisted that because of an agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to end the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation, said Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The Russian airline, which had Russian dead women on board in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 in Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
At the end of the follow-up, the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Mayor, will meet at the end of the board, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism, Astamyr Ahba, told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Human Rights stated that all the costs associated with the transport of bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahab, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims as a result of the bombings of tourists to fly and reside in the Republic, but relatives sent only the authority to the Republic to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 a.m. Moscow time, two explosions erupted in the village of Primorski Gudaut in the warehouse of the missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defence, after which the large-calibre shells and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, a storage facility was set on fire, causing uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian nationals, Elena Polakova, were born in 1970 and Elena Timopheev in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were seriously injured and taken to health facilities in the Republic.
At present, seven persons remain at the station and the rest are discharged.
A large jury will be involved in the study of Russian influence on the US elections
Russia's Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia's impact on the 2016 presidential election, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The Grand Jury's call gives Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations by a panel of jurors that started working a few weeks ago will be the details of the son's meeting then the candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natali Veselinska.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Mueller himself had earlier promised.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump, Jr., had expanded the state of his lawyers.
The Trump Jr. had previously told us that he had been waiting for compromise at the headquarters of the candidate from the Demparty Hillary Clinton, but no disclosure documents had been submitted, and that was the result of adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr. ' s statement to meet with the Mermaid was literally dictated by the Senior Trump.
In the White House, it was clarified that the President did not dictate anything but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Pence has been detained in the workplace.
Irina Shirshin, Deputy Chief of Administration, has been detained for 48 hours at the request of the Investigative Committee at his post, reports RIA Novosti.
Official communications from law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been received, but the UK Press Service has assured them that they will soon follow.
In the Mayor of Pensa, there's no comment on what's happened.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the Pension Administration.
It has been managing urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had long served as Head of the Directorate of the Directorate of the State of the State of the Penzene Region.
Irina Shirshina raises three minors, noting that she became a mother a year ago, gave up her maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there's no cosmodrome or carrier rockets in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person to be in space.
Unlike the Soviet-era monuments that are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments are, on the contrary, "touching the planet".
In 2012, a monument was installed in Houston, U.S.A., near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
A monument in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city centre to the area outside the local airport.
In the 1970s, Gagarin appeared in Riga a monument to Yurius Gagarins.
That's the name of the first spaceman in Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
In 1948, Ford Mercury drove past viewers in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and roared to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The middle - aged man in a suit in a thin strip, with a cigarette, looked through the windshield.
The insiders trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" roared the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The squeezing cry broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just an act.
But when Roger's neck was thrown into a loop, almost all the viewers, and they really hid their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night when the puppet clans lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that in all these years no person has been arrested — although we see them around us; although we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the show.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has fought for human rights throughout his life.
To him, the spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigations, we want closures, we want healings, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice”, he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
Coroner covers a prosthetic body as one of Morse Ford's lynching victims on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI reports received by the BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two linked lynching motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling first allowed black citizens to vote in the primer that was due to take place that summer.
During the same elections, according to the FBI, black performer Roger Malcolm struck the fight with a knife, Burnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that according to the rumours in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and drove to Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchings surrounded the car.
“It is clear that Harrison organized and commanded the killings,” this conclusion is found in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and hid the identities of witnesses."
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attempt at electoral rights,” he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in the city. If you register and vote, the same thing will happen to you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been leading an annual spectacle reproducing this lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is seen, it captures the viewer and tells of a deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch and it's even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own freakiness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
This year's rehearsals began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to a year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
For several years he played the role of chief member of the clan, but he said that the role had never been easier.
"I think I'm lost because it's not the person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at the time."
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Racon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nogga, get out of my house!"
He's screaming Rascona in response.
It's a blow.
At the same time, all (at least all black actors) are exposed to hooch.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it?" Asks Ascon.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
'No,' said the Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the white people said 'Nigga' at the time."
Yes, yes, one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to put out a hard "R."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort is changed by the feeling of companionship.
Everyone has to do everything right, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona speaks the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No man dares.
The spectacle ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, then silence.
A woman in a tumultuous black dress stands above the bodies of actors and sings Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
Within a hundred yards, half a hundred viewers wipe their tears and sweats out of their eyes.
Among the viewers, the number of black and white is almost equal.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live very close by.
They endured for almost eight hours the heavy spirit of Georgia while Brooks led them to the pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the killings had been history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the last note of the song closes, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend down to their heads, touch the paint that depicts the blood, and the immobile bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Green is thanking the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the puppet master.
Nick Rakkon embraces two other actors and suddenly cries, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the spectacle finally came upon him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that."
Later, the audience sat down to have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta livelylyly discusses a spectacle with a black couple they just met.
Deniza Daplinski is struggling to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to those horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that I think lynching is still happening," she adds, "it's only now called shooting the police."
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, was a general concern.
He said that he had already begun to plan the presentation next year.
"The ruling excites us because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it might happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitation Saturday"
The Moscow court of Simon had fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the order of the rally.
The oppositioner was found guilty of the administrative offence provided for in article 20.2 of the CoAP RF, “Repetition of the organization of the rally”.
Earlier, Judge Hyzir Mussakev of the Moscow Court of Justice, completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, leader of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was held accountable under the same article as Naval.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday” held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitators who followed the participants on Saturday, the police felt that the organizers had deliberately hidden its true nature - public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuev, applied for an end to administrative proceedings due to the lack of composition of the offence and pointed out that the police had made some mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov had not been detained on the "agitation Saturday" itself, but he had received an agenda that required him to appear in the police station to discuss the event with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Naval and another opposition partner, Nikolai Leskin.
In Mordovia, a gunned down bride and three guests were arrested
The court in Mordova arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This has been reported to the National Bureau of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 July.
During the fighting, 42-year-old Saranska shot guests several times to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph “a”, of the Criminal Code (“Hooliganism”), article 30, part 3, and article 30, paragraph “a”, article 105, paragraph “e”, and article 105, part 2, of the Criminal Code (“The attempt to kill two or more persons committed in a general manner, by hooliganism”).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests decided to bathe in the area of his water station.
Minenergo will tighten requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules on the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, GES turbines, oil pumping and oil production are launched, equipment suppliers will be required to share access data with Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government ' s decision is already ready and put to public debate.
The new requirements will only apply to “critical energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as information and access to the management of the site by foreign special forces, criminal elements and structures, by unconscionable partners and hackers.
EU expands anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
The press service of the European Union declared on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions had been extended because of a scandal over the supply of Simens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by the "Arguments of the Week".
The press service of the EU Council stated that sanctions against the Russian Federation had been extended because of a scandal with the Simens turbines that had allegedly been brought to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries to increase anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the current day, and the decision had been taken that sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson reduces still 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group, Pierson, announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the launch of a regular restructuring programme aimed at tackling the problems facing their business.
These job cuts, which John Fallon's head said would mainly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that he planned to reduce spending by another 300 million pounds (US$ 394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to bring back to life the business that was hit by a rapid shift to digital learning methods.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share in the Penguin Random House, its partner, Bertelsman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: soldier Natto died as a result of a suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the Karabakh city area.
The explosion is the last of the massacres that struck Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday as a result of an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, Thursday evening's explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by “a man carrying an improvised explosive device”.
All wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IH) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located nearby in Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing on the vehicle resulted in the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had attacked them.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed in a massive explosion in the city centre, the most serious of the human victims of the terrorist attack in the country since the United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether the number of US military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country needs to be increased.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following lawsuits, annuls the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Environmental Protection Agency has overturned the decision to postpone the adoption of Obama's law that states should limit air pollution the day after 15 states were brought before the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone Measurement 2015”, stressing that this step demonstrated the Agency ' s willingness to cooperate with the States.
“We believe in dialogue and feedback with our partners in the states”, said the head of the Environment Agency, Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, filed a lawsuit with the Federal District of Colombia claiming that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to reverse a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme, according to Trump, for a glamorous economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from Democrats and environmental law enforcement organizations concerned about the possible impact of large-scale emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website stated that the use of ozone-containing air to breathe “may make the function of light and increase respiratory symptoms worse”, for example, asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Business disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the RF.
In the view of AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State or Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask police to limit traffic on the Pskov coastline
The Pskov People's Elections addressed the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the town of Sergei Suriname on the issue of the movement along the Great River Coast.
The members of the pride of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Party, and Valery of the Lesnikovs believe that motorists hinder people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, monitoring drivers would help to make the territory more peaceful and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the sign “Walk” and ride freely on the coastline.
It is reported that major repairs and upgrades have been carried out.
Sports and children ' s playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the Pskov Information Agency is patrolling the central coast at evenings of the PPS Motor Patrol and the wife.
As a result, the number of passing cars is decreasing, but the movement is not stopped.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that investigative authorities should not remove servers and hard disks from working computers in businesses.
The Head of State stated this at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, “application should be excluded for the purpose of investigating measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if the investigators had such a need, “sufficient copies should be removed, certified and used during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that “conditions cannot be created to prevent the business from continuing until it is impossible to pay taxes”.

British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in a series of Harry Potter novels, died at 92 years of age.
That's what the Independent reported on Thursday.
His family told him about the death of the actor.
They say that he lived a “great life, having achieved success in cinema, theatre and television in 70 years of his career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltnem.
In 1959, he played with Lawrence Olivia at The Coriolan Tragedy on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.
Hardy also remembered the repeated performance of Prime Minister Winston Churchill's role, including in one of the screenings of Agatha Christi's works on Ms. Marple.
As a result of Churchill's role in the BBC Television Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Cinematographic and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to serve as U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on several occasions.
Something went wrong in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Labour, refused to be buried with his venerable wife, Queen Margret.
This year, it's a golden wedding, but on the agenda of the couple, it's not the preparations for the celebrations, it's the money dispute.
His Highness has waived the title of Consort Prince, and he has bound the Queen to the point that she has never regretted the title of Consort King.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the queen's wife.
Russia's M.I.D. urges Washington to stop scarming Moscow
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russia responded to Mike Pens' statements accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy department some time ago.
In its comment, the MlD pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold-war stamps that were inadequate in modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop the bullying of the RF.
As the week's arguments were written earlier, US Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and to organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving to hold the most exciting boxing match up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN Canal in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated champion in the light weight of the World Boxing Council, walked down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's second semi-light weight champion.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in the four weight categories of Erin Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in battle with Miguel Marriagoa on Saturday at seven o'clock on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive struggle between them would be the very first time.
“I used to be in a light weight,” Garcia recalled.
"I went up to the Bronner category [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm drawing for 140.
I want to go down to the semi-light.
And he needs to go up to the semi-easy [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a match.
That's what the sick people want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this match.
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy to be followed by Lomachenko in his 135th-later debut this year to set up a meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who was also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world's lightweight championship in the Forum on 23 September.
“The fight could be on PPV because all the sick people asked for it”, Garcia said, expressing his willingness to fight later on the channel that would offer better financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready.
Garcia said she considered Lomachenko a “shocking boxer” and might visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately give Garcia praise and said that he thought the champion in the three weights of Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of impact, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing before their own individual.
"This fight must take place.
No other fight is so interesting and interesting.
I am more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the cannon fighters, and here he is, Mikey.
This will be a great battle.”
On several central streets, Moscow will turn traffic into weekends
On these weekends, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted to the capital on the Tver Street from Nastasin Street to the Triumphal Square, as well as to the 1st Twersk-Jam Street movement.
In addition, the road will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Twerska-James Street.
Both lanes will be covered at all sites, reported by the Moscow Department of Transport Information Centre.
The streets will be paved from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August in connection with their upgrading.
Also on the weekend, the movement will be closed at the Moscow Coastal.
That's where the charging park continues.
Putin ordered the Attorney General to check on Baikal.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to conduct a verification of Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Henprocuratorate to inspect the Baikal Territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested action if the facts of the violations were identified.
New tests have been published to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden
Recent tests by asylum-seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of age show that more than 80 per cent of the protestors have been evaluated as over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized that it had not been able to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
Currently, migrationverket has sent 6,880 trials, and the forensics agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were evaluated as 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the forensics agency estimated that the tested “probably 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are only carried out in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Géranceson of the Forensics Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past months.
“We do not see much difference with statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate”, he said to The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were considered under the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely, the age of 18 years tested or more”.
However, after considering 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age, consisting of X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and of the tomography of the knee joints and of giving them to dentists and x-rays, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolina Institute of Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have been through sexual maturation sooner or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think I should use the measurement methods that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus very uncertain.
If we cannot determine it with confidence, we should not do what we can," he told Metro.
However, Gérancen of the Forensics Agency favoured the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk is wrong to accept a child as an adult.
We face the greatest risk when a person is 18 years old, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During his work trip to Buryatija, Vladimir Putin saw that he was ready to consider whether to run for President of Russia in the 2018 elections, he passed the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Čermoška Buratska oblast.
During the videoconference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatiya and the Irkut region, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovic, we ask you: When the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to re-election this post.”
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in reply.
On 28 July, President Dmitry Peskov, Russian Press Secretary, commented on some media comments that Vladimir Putin, the pre-election headquarters, would be headed by President Anton Vajno, head of the administration.
Sandov called these assumptions “nothing based on hypothetical reasoning”.
“There are no headquarters until the establishment of headquarters far away from the electoral campaign”, said Peskov.
“It’s not on the agenda yet,” said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, a representative of the Democratic Party of Jim Justice, announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
“You like it or not, but the Democrats have drifted away from me,” said Governor Justis.
“Today I am telling you with many prayers and many reflections... today I am telling you, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer be of use to you as governor-democracy.”
The rally blew up with applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration for the republican”, Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it is time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won in West Virginia at 42 per cent, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, since he inherited the coal business from his father.
Its status is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement Thursday evening that “The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is rather hindering than hindering our country from making our country great again”.
“Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of the party that has no leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message”, said CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ron McDeniel, in a statement.
A cat named Mr. Krasavczyk found a home thanks to the Socs
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Krasavczyk over 14 kg after becoming famous for the Internet.
Mashable reports that.
At the end of June, a cat photo was posted on Facebook, asking to find its owner, because "someone was clearly feeding him earlier."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the face of an animal could become a new meme.
More than 3.2 thousand comments and 15,000 comments were received.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to host Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman said that she had already had this experience: she had taken a cat about 10 kilograms [10 kg] home, and now it weighs just over five pounds [5 kg].
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with a photograph of an animal collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could well make a career in the model business.
Cow praised Russia's “honest” apology for the doping scandal
International Light Athletics Specialist Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he called a sincere apology by Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not a good time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Light Athletics Federation, Dmitry Putin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations, which had passed the world's light athletics championship before, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen from the competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted in favour of the continuation of the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the findings of the State-funded drug use.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” said the president of the International Association of Athletic Federations of Coe.
“All the council and all the congress have enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing its utmost to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Coe said he also “pleasanted” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, which now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” said Ko.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the smoldering system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletic Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the world's light athletics championship, which will begin in London on Friday.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements remained to be met for Russia's reconstruction.
As he reported to reporters in London following a report made by the International Association of Athletic Federations Board, drug testing is not yet in sufficient volume, and retired trainers are still doing their job peacefully.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of having been
A journalist, Vasily Muravitski, detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (PSS) for a period of two months, is transferring the BSP.
A staff member of the Zitomir Journal of the Internet suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and in violation of Ukraine ' s territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities' actions against the journalist, viewing it as a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy opted for a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
A patrol ship, Commander Borsini, entered Libyan territorial waters to then, together with the Navy of that country, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, after all, does not control most of the territory of the country.
The opposition to the Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan Cabinet of Faiz Saraj, recognised by Europe.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were published in July on the number of illegals coming from Libya: 95,000 from the beginning of the year.
In the Government, resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A major malfunction occurred in Skype
The global malfunction in Skype was recorded today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began sending complaints to programme developers.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to address the problems faced by European and North American citizens, according to RIA News.
It will be recalled that there was also a malfunction in Skype's work this June.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Competitive Ukraine in athletics were suspended from participating in the CMM
Olga Zemljak and Olesia Powch, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from the compulsive Ukraine for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the country ' s Light Athletics Federation (FLAU) website.
Such a decision was taken by the organization in connection with the launching of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings in respect of foot-and-mouthed women.
Coach Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects an athlete in the use of doping.
Pooh is the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European Championship in the 4 to 100 metres, and Zemljak is the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the 4 to 400 metres stage.
The World Athletics Championship in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Neumar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record holder from transferring Neumar from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris St. Germain, France.
Whatever the impact may be on the chain, the Paris Saint-Jerman by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in which the authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
It follows from the financial rules of the Fair Plays introduced by the UEFA in 2011, that the FGM will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neumar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Naimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
These are some of the financial aspects of Naimar's move to France.
“FRI” can be very expensive to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, taking into account the funding of the team by the rich energy of the Katara family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player felt that clubs in debt in their pursuit of success had essentially cheated and risked destruction in case banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abramovic in Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a world brand, it became a difficult plan to implement.
During this three-year evaluation period, which covers 2018, clubs may lose EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum was disgracefully removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive, and we will move forward to tighten the rules”, Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the FGM will pay for the purchase of Naimar's contract at the same time, it may distribute the amount throughout the duration of its contract for reporting purposes.
Neumar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as costs of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on FFG and Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
A fine of €60 million (at that rate is $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, was ordered to limit its team to the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of regular 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that can try to overestimate its financial inspections by blowing up their income on the account of the club owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored the FGM, if the amount of funding were to exceed the standard market price, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of financing of the “FGM” from the Qatar Tourism Office had been blown up.
It was reported that part of Naymar's earnings at the PIC could have been paid by the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PWW and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will be the world's champion, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the FGM mean that UEFA will follow any attempts to circumvent the rules even more closely.
As reported on Thursday, UEFA did not engage in preliminary discussions with the PIC on the transfer of Neumar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the provision of the “FGM”.
According to the latest published report, between 2015 and 1016, FGM received more than €10 million in turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
“PJ” expects the arrival of Naimar to be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and team logo T-shirts.
The club assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish league tried to disrupt Naimar's transfer, saying that the FGM would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the state”, President La Liga Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, bearing in mind that the final owner of the “FGM” is Qatar.
Coach Arsenala Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the funding of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of participating, and this has completely changed the football landscape over the last 15 years”, Wenger said Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is becoming very difficult to respect the financial fairway because there may be many ways and many reasons for being represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of swearing will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the relevant legislation has been developed by the State Committee on Law and Statehood.
A week ago, MPs planned to determine directly how to swear an oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated, followed by the amended text of the Law on the Nationality of the Russian Federation (available to the “Notices”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
On 6 June, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of taking an oath in place of formal signing by the Russian Federation during a meeting with Gosduma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The MPs formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of a bill to repeal the decision on the issue of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (article 2, paragraph 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), and for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act relates to terrorism (article 4, paragraph 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was that when a person forms citizenship documents, he is under a promise to comply with Russian law - he stands on the path of extremism, and he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the industrial factions Vladimir Vasilev ("The One Russia"), Gennady Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Gyrinovski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("The Right Russia") and the Speaker of DG Viacheslav Wolodin.
On 19 May, he was accepted on first reading.
Last week, the Committee of the Civil Engineering and Legislation Committee approved the draft draft for second reading, but is now recast.
It now states that the order of taking an oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Nationality of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the Russian State coat of arms and flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Justice.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - the list of places where the coat of arms could be located is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, heads of government, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the regs.
The solemn oaths that wish to obtain the nationality of the RF will be made after officials have verified their documents.
But a Russian passport will be obtained only after the oath has been sworn in, followed by a refined text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in at the age of 18 and not at the age of 14.
There was a rule under which incapacitated or limitedly effective oaths would be released from swearing, as well as those who could not pronounce, read or sign the oath by hand.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine who are considered Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a statement to the competent authority of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Denial of “foreign” nationality, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-Speaker, DG Ivan Melnikovov (KPRF), Natalya Poklonska, Pavel Krašeninnikov and Irath Farrahov (all "The One Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are looking forward to deciding their fate regarding the nationality of the Russian Federation, as Paul Krašeninnikov (ER) Head of the Committee on State Planning and Law explained earlier.
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who gave up their “other” nationality in writing and gave their former passport to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons beyond their control” did not cease to be a national of another country.
It is now forbidden for foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed at facilities and organizations whose activities relate to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a residence permit of another country cannot become a member of the State or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017, by then the necessary regulations should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in the Hot American Summer and the Comrade Detective.
The current iteration of history is nostalgic at the same time as the famous days of the characters in the 1980s; the age of the branch in the 1990s (for example, when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Shawlter made a comedy of "State" for MTV); and about themselves, about 2001, before her stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Radd, moved on to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is at the same time the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking vegetable bank by H. John Benjamin).
The result is a double joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; thus, it is impossible to return to the joke.
"Ten years later", where adults have played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more systemic, and includes reefs from the 1990s stalwart films "Hands Climbing the Hull".
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and a house of other things from 1991.
Many plots are the same.
The generous Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet parted with virginity.
And there's still a crazy and mean conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (so Shawwalter) who's now being incited by George Bush the Elder.
As always, the best part of the franchise is the deviations from it.
It's especially fun to see a young man named Radh singing Matt Dillon's song from "The Ones," a character whose ex-big man Andy now looks old-fashioned.
This franchise could bring success to random insanity in the spirit of the recursive Seven Up series until it reaches its logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the entire company would go to the premiere of the movie "The Hot American Summer".
A fellow detective in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the cold war of the Americans, the blast blonde, or even the flash with her images of the East and West fighting.
This comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Reese Thomas, depicts a television: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and a Marxist-Lenian path.
The main roles of Gregor's life and the idealist Joseph are played by Florin Piersick, Jr. and Cornelia Ulysses, and their dialogues by Channing Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police are spending time watching a chess match like Americans could watch football).
A team of famous cast votes, including Jenny Slatt, Nick Oferman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Seviniya, makes it interesting to play "guess your voice".
But Detective Comrade is so clinging to the possibility of an unscrupulous propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which it often looks like.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and it's funny not very often.
If you make it shorter, the "Friend Detective" could do better with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people in the lobby who absorb a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary Communist viewer, this image says that Western culture can do anything to digest.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and so do they.
The prize fund for the Russian Super Bowl for football between Spartacus and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by Sergei Prudkin, President of the Russian Football League (RFPL), at a press conference.
According to the head of RFPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, RT reported.
He also added that there were almost no tickets to the match so far.
The match "Spartak"- "Lokomotiv" will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is the current champion of the RF and Lokomotiv is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young men cleaned the furniture for 200,000 rubles
A 37-year-old man with a furniture company approached the police the other day.
The man stated that he had stolen expensive instruments from the factory, causing serious damage to his production.
The mining of sparrows has become instruments worth nearly 200,000 roubles — two welding machines, a perforator, a plumber, a swan.
Orderly guards began to search for criminals and soon came to the inhabitants of the Blagoveshten district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24.
According to the media service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the participants entered the premises of the enterprise, broke in the front door and brought out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service that got hit.
They have already been prosecuted for theft, and only a fraction of the stolen instruments have been returned to the rightful owner by law enforcement officials.
Mr. Medvedev commented on the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States
The United States of America and Russia should be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nauert in response to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ' s comments on the relations of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the RF a full trade war.
In commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were “low”, but noted that “areas for interaction should be sought”.
"Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
“And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia”, reads RIA Novosti's diplomat.
However, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions were tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, last Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "growing" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has completed the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They've got five new rings and three roller skates on the bar.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan produced two new rings and a coulomb of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, performed in the technique of gliptics (hand carving by stone) and pavaca and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that he had grown in his Grandville furniture, the modeler Christian Dior, and the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found guilty of worsening relations with Russia
The President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has been critical of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is extremely low and dangerous.
"You can thank Congress, these people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK earlier.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the United States to enter into profitable transactions and would bring the RF, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Viktor Prokopenya, an entrepreneur from Belarus, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary.
The businessman explained his decision to the RBC with the intention of “focusing on other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step would be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium of Grigoria Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Sayid Gutzeriev in July.
Russian banks left the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Petr Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, in addition to WTB and the Foreign Bank, became Sbergbank.
Nowak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF described the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the agency, Alexander Novak, explained the situation.
According to him, the peninsula lost electricity due to a road accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck that fell into the DMV hit the power lines, resulting in the disconnection of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Power failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists have cleared the mess within hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been an abnormal heat.
Bank of England will maintain interest rates of 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have caused rumours of a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain impatient and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressures on family income.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) specialists voted with result 6 to 2 for keeping the rate 0.25%, with fewer members of the Committee this month favouring an increase in the rate because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in autumn.
However, the bank had warned that an increase in interest rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by brequite, and said that loan costs would likely have to be raised more strongly than expected in the financial markets.
Committee members also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago as a result of brequite.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency funding plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it now has £15 billion to be provided under the plan, up to £115 billion.
According to the MPC's main projections, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow as soon as possible, while pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption.
On the question of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, “some tightening of financial policies” would require “a little more” than markets expected.
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank ' s projected increase in this and the following year is lower than the projections made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent unconsoled growth rates had weakened the increased expectation of an increase; then GDP rose 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to a bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest report on inflation gave little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very little wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure would increase before it went down.
The Bank added that the financial policy “can’t prevent” the failure to earn in the next few years, but expects the salaries “significantly” to be recovered by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low rate of the pound, which offsets some of the lower consumer costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rates were reduced to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of the referendum on the exit of the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
It is estimated that it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its latest decision at the rates, there was an increase in noise around the projected increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly pressing on and so intensely pressured households: three members of the committee of specialists asked for an increase of 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation dropped to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that this decline was expected and again compensated in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is the result of a low rate of pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Correco, said: “If we take into account the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of credits, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The State Health Service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV-prevention drug after a battle in the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposure HIV (PREP), a pre-sex pill that had been shown to reduce the risk of infection in the risk group by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probationary period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ' s ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PEP, despite her claims that it should be financed by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation”, by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Agency (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Before the programme is fully launched throughout England by April 2018, venerological dispensers in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PREP before sex in a person's body, there are enough drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for treatment include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and not receiving successful treatment.
The dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug-supply contract this week following an international procurement tender.
The study was designed to assess the full potential of the PREP for the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and use on a large scale.
“This crucial innovation should complement and strengthen the wide-ranging and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National Directorate for AIDS Control), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PREP, if it is literately targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group have been given access to a new means of self-control, without discussing it with their partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “At present, it is essential to make sure that the test takes place quickly throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we have been provided with the experimental drug PREP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PREP test, it has been very late due to months of delays and delays by the Government.”
Data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the cessation of transmission of this year's infection.
This test will bring us closer to a step towards a full understanding of the benefits of the PREP.
It is now important that the test be deployed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk of HIV and move us further towards ending HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution supporting the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Assembly of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of retaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positively recommended form of the organization of the highest public authority in the Republic and expresses the national interests of the whole of the Tatar people”.
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
It is a reminder that the Moscow-Caña treaty has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the deputies of the Secretary-General of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called “president”.
In Russia, difficulties arose in obtaining international driving rights
The GIBDD units lack international driving permits (IAPs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait a few weeks in a row, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to go abroad or to rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
IDPs were introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on the specific police or rental offices: some require IDPs and some require sufficient national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers of international law still receive, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratified countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all GIBDD units, reports Kommersanta, by conducting a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, there are just no handouts in the UGBDD units, and the forms have been missing for four months.
It is possible to sign up on the public service website, but the turn has already been extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained “for technical reasons”, without going into detail, in Samarsk, it is frankly said that there are no forms, a similar situation in other cities.
Many Moscows have already encountered the problem, and social media reports are increasing:
Irina Burmistrov: "Guess why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIBDD offices have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question of those who know."
International law must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always been far ahead, there's no handouts in place (the button is there, but it can't give a ticket).
It's like the State Service Portal shows that in Spob, it's free-of-shit time.
Has anyone tried to get it in another city?
Is it gonna work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for forms of international driving licences have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the Gosavtoins inspection unit.
This may be due to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, and this has not been reported before.
Blanky purchases the Road Safety Special Purpose Centre (AVC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the GIBDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were signed with AO Gozák: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IMU forms were manufactured, in 2016 15,000 forms were purchased, in 2017, 90,000, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the OOO "First Printing Court" for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the CNS just failed to get a tender in time, which is why there's been a deficit.
After all, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel alone, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are being adopted there, it is not clear, so people are being re-insured, and so there is a huge demand for international “steps”.
Recently, it was known that professional drivers would have to pass the examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The International Driver ' s Certificate (IAP) of the new model has been in effect since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the "Reviewer" portal.
No respected international company will even put a bolt or hook there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
“That is, in my deep conviction, there is actually no prospect for this project,” said Petrenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, whole stadiums have begun to collapse.
“I believe, therefore, that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been shortsighted enough to join this project”, the official said.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a cart of the Crimea Bridge.
A large collection of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed on the Kerchny coast, with its vault being closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared a railway ark for fairway support” - reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and Krasnodar region.
In Spain, an employee who had not worked for 10 years was fired
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) did the Spanish official, Charles Resio, have?
The permanent walk extended for 10 long years.
After all, Mr. Rescio was still fired.
But not your immediate boss.
That's the only thing that doesn't happen in the bureaucrat world.
The invaders seem to have gotten used to all the "ministers of the people" pranks.
Yet, officials are constantly able to surprise those whose taxes are not bad.
This time, "sensation" was mourned by Spain.
There, a member of the Valencia archive, Charles Resio, has managed for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time, he was paid regularly.
And it's all solid -- 50,000 euros a year.
And here's Mr. Resio's "weird times" are over.
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
The investigation revealed that an angry walker came to the office every morning at 7:00 p.m. to get into the electronic system.
And he was going home right now.
Once again, he showed up at the workplace at 4 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
Ten years.
It was also known that the walker spent all his free time painting comic books at home.
Members of the Valencian Legislative Assembly are now considering how to punish Mr. Rescio, who could not help but know how to work actively in his workplace.
Judges offer protection from Presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRH) has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HR Committee proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Courts and to introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRW wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential mandate.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals to strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was commissioned by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, who was given by the President following a meeting with members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as the issue of public control in places of detention (see “U” of 9 December).
The work of the HR Committee resulted in 25 proposals dealing both with the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One idea of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presiding officers of the courts to improve the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully won a competition and received the support of the judiciary, the President of the court, in the opinion of the HR Committee, should submit him to appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to distribute cases to judges.
Experts are allowed to do so, perhaps a specially written computer program.
The HR Committee also considers that the Chairman is not entitled to “predict the results of the qualification of the judge, initiate his disciplinary action, decide on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the Presidents of the Courts by the Judges themselves” and “to give them powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the Presidents of the Courts (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President to represent the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HR Committee proposes to reorganize appeals and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The HR Committee states that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the regional level of the judiciary in the RF but in the judicial districts”.
Experts base the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “court districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the FF, but which guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using “telephone law”.
The HR Committee proposes to strengthen the people's parliaments to consider some “civil and administrative categories” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“These are only our proposals”, explained HHR member, Judge of the Constitutional Court at the resignation of Tamara Morszczakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only to the HR Committee but also to the Supreme Court (CC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the mandate of the Air Force (between the co-executors - the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, the President of the Russian Federation, Viacheslav Lebedev, is due by 1 September.
Living a high life: half-story and fancy designer receptions turned this little apartment into a spacious apartment in Earls Court
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a nice model house in the style of Queen Anna, and in favour of a new design, says Joan did not collect her belongings or move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger square," Joan relates.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first sighting, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been fully renovated.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complicated planning — to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen — and Joanna wanted to add storage space and half-story to maximize the benefits of the generous ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be useful for Joan.
The ceiling was not high enough to build two spaces above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-terrestrial, where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to put the rooms in such a way that they were above each other, and we did not have to bend.
It was necessary not to simply build a simple platform, but to avoid constructions so that they were at the right height and allowed to use spaces above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms above each other in the space in question — and much more interesting.
From the ground up through the winding copper light window from the “Retrouvius” opens a view of a lovely guesthouse at the bottom.
The gold-stretched mirror furniture, silver accents, and screw-up lighting from Serge Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
A short corridor with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance mirror cabinets are used to store Joan's entire vessel.
In order to create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can encroach on the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in emerging kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a sliding door like a garage.
“A engineering art has been used here,” Erfan will tell us about the reinforced steel of the wood-fibrous shield door.
“It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the sex area is exactly what you will be selling, that is, what your real estate is valued for”, says Erfan.
“In short, the real estate agent will enter and calculate on the basis of sex.”
Here they were able to increase the area of the sexes by using quality materials that give space to the shades of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional relationship with the house,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with electricity in the walls.
It is important, but it does not hurt the strings of our hearts.”
This is a testimony to the fact that, according to good design and increased metering, the apartment can turn from something common to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a Commission on State Cultural Policy.
The relevant regulation is published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed as Head of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy Strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries declined to an eight-year minimum
The increase in consumer prices in G20 countries has declined to the minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent - lower in October 2009 when the price index reached 1.7 per cent.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a 0.1 per cent decrease in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded the first Sunday deflation in 2017.
Inflation in Russia is estimated at 4.1 per cent.
The economy, however, believes that the target has already been achieved, according to the agency ' s version, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal removal of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on environmental development of natural Baikal territory.
During the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donskoska, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits logging during the fires, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored so that “not all things are cut out”.
Donski noted that the bill involved monitoring by the CDM and oversight agencies.
Media: Air Force fighters secretly from command agree with Donbass militia
On the line of armed resistance, Donbass has established a regular telephone connection.
Combating parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is unknown at headquarters.
The VSU and Donbass militia made cell phone communications hidden from their high command.
On 4 August, “Strana.ua” refers to military operations in Donbass.
According to the publication, unit commanders know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily on the telephone.
Communication is not domestic at all: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Often the result of such talks is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists have been informed of occasions when congratulations on the birthday of an officer were received from the front line from his formal enemy.
The WSU and the DNR and LNR militia have been in the trenches on the boundary line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
MlD has outraged the blocking of UN CB statements on attacks against the RF Embassy
In the Russian foreign policy office, they are outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block UN Sovbez statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian M.I.D.
In the Ministry, it was recalled that the Russian Embassy's territory in Damascus was bombarded by the Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham groups (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra) and Fylaq Al-Rahman on 2 August for the third time a month.
Bearing in mind that the international community has unanimously qualified Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSC resolutions have called for opposition to this structure, the RUF noted that “it would be clear that the Nusra attacks must meet with universal unequivocal and strong condemnation and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of exit against diplomatic missions”.
However, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, France and Ukraine on the Security Council, as emphasized in the diplomatic department, “have, for the third time in a month, been blocking the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft press statement condemning terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”.
The unwillingness to exercise diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“It is most regrettable that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to pursue new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them the feeling of impunity”, the MlD said, adding that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of out-of-work checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at the investment project meeting in the Far East, said that the number of out-of-plan business audits should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, and said that ten-day inspections should be limited.
“Unplanned checks are usually carried out without proper agreement with the Public Prosecutor’s Office; only 2-3 per cent are agreed with the Public Prosecutor’s Office, and everything else goes on its own”, the President of the TASS quoted him as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from removing servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, in the President ' s view, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“I hope that this will give some positive effect to business-related or entrepreneurship-related cases”, the head of State said.
As “U” reported, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs was increasing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman, Boris Titov, President of Russia, conducted a survey which revealed that there had actually been a replacement of the planned checks by non-planned means (the percentage of those who encountered them increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and citizen claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria’s largest real estate trade empires — more than $500 million — forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former head of Carlton Football Club and builder Colin de Lutis live in the Turkish Palace three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him for division of property and assets with the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a heated divorce dispute.
Together with their mother, Anna’s brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 shopping points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family list now includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Bouller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
In agreement with the late father, Colin, whom Paul describes as “the main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paula is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best pieces of property”, he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings of the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, which, according to Paul, Colin excluded it.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are rising as a snowfall: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including Royal Lawyer Allan Myers, and the best snipers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they managed dairy bars and gastronomy and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of school and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louis often told me that she didn't want the brothers to know in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark received $10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Board of Directors and, according to Eddie McGirra's best friend, a biography published in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, a text message stating that since the case had not yet been dealt with in court, "I am the truth of the matter."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to blink the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "he still hopes for a solution to the conflict".
On Friday, that hope seemed to be distracted.
"The decision in our case will soon be brought by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump's office plans to limit the information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly can make it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of the White House Office plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief calmer.
That's what reporter Josh Dosey says.
“At a meeting held by the new head of the White House Office, John F. Kelly, with the management of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trumpe, whom he hoped he would resolve: bad channels of access to information to the President.”
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through him, either in paper form or through briefings, because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is correct, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump down by tracing his information.
President Trump's relationship with television came a few decades ago -- and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair publicity of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair publicity in publications that could be reassuranced”, said Sam Nanberg, former adviser to the electoral headquarters, in February.
Tara Palmer wrote at the time in “Policy”, that “six former members of the electoral headquarters said that, in order to control Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant flow of praise in his personal information.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material -- reliable or not -- that confirms their views.
“Politics” - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly send questionable information to the President.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone posted an article with GotNews.com on the Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, where Katy Welles, Deputy Chief of Staff, was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
No matter Johnson is forever distracted by Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he has failed to present specific facts or that he has in the past filed false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and asked the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then head of Raines Pribus and the secretary of Rob Porter's office "tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of paper that Trump receives".
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his assistants continue to fight for each other's influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Prison Procurator ' s Office is fighting HIV dissident
The Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalinin Rajsud Tumena, who dropped the criminal case against a local resident who had died of HIV from a minor daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was a HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order to avoid setting a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The Tumeni resident case was initiated under article 109 of the Criminal Code (cause of reckless death) in April after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection, 4B.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman has not been treated alone and has refused to treat her daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection”, explained the Tumensky Procurator ' s Office.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalinin Paradise of Tumena, which decided on 25 July to end it.
The father of the girl who had died, explained that he “forgave his wife, had no claims against her, had done damage and apologized”.
The Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the order to terminate the case be lifted and that it be sent for further consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to undo the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's office reported.
In the view of the oversight body, it should be punished, otherwise it would be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As reported at the Tumen AIDS Centre, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in the Tumen area who are not receiving medical care because of parental refusal.
“And this situation has already improved — during the year of the ad hoc group’s work, half the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their minds — have been able to diagnose, start taking drugs,” said the Press Secretary of the Centre for AIDS, Elena Loshev.
According to her, it was not possible to influence parents in a legislative way, and not all HIV-infected children were found to be unreviewable; mothers did not allow them to be examined, hid, fled from hospitals.
What is the risk of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement in Russia.
HIV dissidents are referred to as people who deny HIV and refuse to take drugs.
NCO AIDS doctors and activists call such views anti-medical, and they see a serious threat in their dissemination.
The yellow photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August at the Greek railway station in Hmelnick.
The merry company of drunk young people walked over the railways, where the freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making an effective selfie on the roof of the wagon, reported "FACTAM" in the police communications sector in the Hmelnitsk region.
The guy started coming down from the bridge on the train, but because of his recklessness, he got caught up in the power line and immediately got hit by the current.
Fortunately, the station's dispatcher was aware of this, which immediately called an "emergency".
Prior to the arrival of the victim's doctors, they were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Hmelnica Regional Clinical Hospital.
The men were diagnosed with 1 to 2 degree torso burns.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that recently, extreme selfies are gaining popularity on the roofs of multi-storeys, bridges that are moving.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to avoid such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
There could have been oceans in ancient Venus.
That was the assumption made by French scientists.
Scientists have created a computer model that has demonstrated the process of water education on the surface of the planets, says Science News.
It turns out that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were oceans that had 10 percent more water than on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed four billion years ago on Mars.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of the shooting in the park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting, reports the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a large number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the evildoers could not be considered, since they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third injured is minor, there is no details of his condition.
Located on the hill Dolores Park is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.

The Gypsies crossed the trenches and returned to the “millionaires' street”
Some of the strongest owners of Western Midland are once again in conflict with the determined Gypsies who have overcome the trenches dug by the municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which was called the “millionaire street”.
Bringing with them horses, infants and many houses on wheels, they returned after being expelled as soon as May, and they were not prevented by a trench dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical company found a gap in the defence facilities and ran its vehicles through a section that was left unhindered to leave room for the tropics.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that it was “incapacitated to solve the problem”.
An anonymous local resident reported: “They arrived here on Monday night after being expelled from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and they returned.
Last night, more Gypsies came, and today, perhaps even more.
“Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court orders to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like paying the municipal tax anymore, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.”
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, “This is ridiculous, we have just seen these gypsies leave the last time, and this attack continues.”
This time more and we even saw a horse fall on the ground."
A representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: “We know about an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbruck Road and are cooperating with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
In order to help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This allows us to draw up a picture of the situation before the court when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the factory of champagne wines "New Light"
The New World Champagne Wines Factory of the Republic of Crimea has decided to share, transforming the New World Champagne Wine Factory into the OAU, following orders from the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's identity.
The equity company ' s statutory capital will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if no funds were available for the modernization of the plant within the next three years, there would be a threat of a plant being stopped.
Exports of core funds to the enterprise amounted to about 60-70 per cent.
Modernization requires 1.2 billion rubles, owing to the specificities of the institutional and legal form, it is required to make 50 per cent of the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about borrowing large credit organizations hard,” said the Minselhoza of Crimea, Sergei Petelin, in April of this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the privatisation forecast for 2017.
It was proposed that it should be held and auctioned.
The Interfax source in the Crimea authorities estimated the possible value of the sale of the company at $40 million, the investment of the investor in modernization at $30 million.
The New Light in 2016 increased the production of grapevine wines by 2.8%, compared to 2015 levels, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New Light intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golicin as a plant for the production of wine in the name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares [11 ha] of land.
Lower-city third graders have broken down more than 40 tombs
The Ministry of Internal Affairs personnel in the Lower City Region have established the identity of the citizens who destroyed 46 tombs at the cemetery of the town of Lyskovo.
The third - grade disciples proved to be evildoers.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown persons was received by Russia ' s OMCD in the Lyskov region on 27 June.
In this regard, 24 persons have been contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects and found them two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching the monuments fall, and that led them to bullying.
Prevention activities have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone with regard to the ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities," said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turkish daily Stampa.
The warning of Minnita came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and was facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked throughout the year, has waived its comments on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone now”, the organization said in social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now brought, only after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet vessel since October.
His crew suspected that he had taken all the lifeboats on board migrants whom traffickers had sent directly to them and had allowed smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, as stated in the indictments published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather from humanitarian zeal than from any other motive.
The code of conduct assumes that the Juventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code: Save the Children Code, the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa spread arms from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not entail any “significant change or interference” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support the Libyan coastguard and to cooperate with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly stepped up their policies in the Libyan direction and, with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposition Libyan parties have frequented.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement at the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation and Gosduma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told "U", what the goals of Moscow in the region were and who it was betting on.
The contact group on Libya you're leading is hardly known.
So let's say the contact group on Ukraine, everybody knows about it.
And here's the secret curtain.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the RF and the State Duma.
Its activities are directed by the Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy Duma of Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the Gosduma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The group was driven by the detention of the Russian tanker Mechanik Chebotarev in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of Gosduma, was established and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you manage to lead her?
Since I have been working for Libya since 2008, I have been invited to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the "Mechanic of Chebotarev".
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups confronting each other in the Libyan conflict - and with Tripoli (where the recognized UN Government is based, headed by Faiz Saraj. - "U") and with Tobruk (the House of Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifu Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "U")
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya, “U”), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make better use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we are having a dialogue with everyone.
How many are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya all the time?
The contact group now includes five persons.
These include people with experience in the force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We would also like to join a team of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the RA.
There is no permanent presence in Libya of any of our staff members, yet there is no need.
Are there any Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors?
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications do not correspond to that.
But your contact group has ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militia units are based, who have played a role in the validation of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 and have been significantly intensified in the years to come).
We came to Missouri in January this year.
We were intimidated, told that everything was Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyse the real military potential, who is responsible for why such rumours, what is really the role of Islamists there.
In Missouri, we met with all the representatives of the teams that were involved in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016, the city on the Mediterranean coast was taken from the militants of the Russian-prohibited "Islamic State" "U").
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to check information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in destroying the IG in Libya, not the Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Did the Islamic State in Libya win the Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar performed operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the IH in Sirte was fought by structures subordinated to the Government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we have invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-terrorism operation.
And they arrived - the visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, Duma, MID and Rosgwardia.
As we understand it, you are in all Libyan regions and you probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think the ceasefire agreements reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj could be implemented?
Or, once again, as has been the case in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar had agreed to another meeting has been a good signal, not long ago has it been possible.
In the recent past, both leaders have responded very negatively to each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Missouri, and Haftar boarded the Russian air carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in Missouri.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are having a dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been talking.
Does it facilitate understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level that they have twice studied in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian, if he knows, is very relative.
But what he taught us certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they are, speaking beautifully in Russian.
And they're reaching out to Russia, and they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider the imminent lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in Russian arms shipments?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said before, we are not taking sides in this conflict and would not want to arm each other at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to facilitate its withdrawal.
Libya is now actively advancing the constitutional process.
We hope that the parties will come up with compromise solutions and internal consensus.
The elections should then be held, as discussed at the Saraj and Haftar meeting.
If an election is held and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties now have such status), the issue of lifting an arms embargo can be asked at the UN Sovbeg.
To raise this issue now senselessly and dangerously will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
During the days, the media reported that Italy, which faced the problem of floating from Libya to African refugees, felt left to chance by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its relations with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that Haftar's troops will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Missouri and the South.
The tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this regard, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about crossing the flow of migrants on far-off raids?
I mean, basically, did they turn the buses around, where Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring the Southerners together in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But to begin with, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a proponent of the introduction of Sharia norms.
How radical is he?
Will this not be an obstacle to relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not going there.
And we mixed all their maps and started to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft concluded a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State oil company NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom head Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, was directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil by Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What else does Russia have economic interests in Libya?
In plans to resign the contracts concluded at Muammar Qaddafi.
These include, inter alia, previous transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electricity) and a number of other arrangements.
And the Libyans have something to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
I mean, as in Iran, this is an oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is going to be, I don't really deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree on each other so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be an environment conducive to the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and getting terrorists out of there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former Soviet Union?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that no Russian national and other former USSR countries were there to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and the Russian language did not sound there.
What kind of States, then, are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into that detail.
Then let's put it another way.
How many Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans, no more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
That's the plan.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
A few more visits must take place, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the fundraisers raised money for a dear gift to a sick boy
In the Melihovo Submersible Museum, nine-year-old Sasha Macola, who has a DCP, a brain hydrocephaly and full blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill on 5 August.
A useful presentation will be given by Sache, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oxana Kosarev and Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum.
The money for the training was collected during the charity marathon “Don’t Stop Doing Good” which was held in Melikhov on 15 July on the Day of Remembrance of Čekov.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, they received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushino Chekhovsky, "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd love to get a treadmill to get my legs strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit."
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the service at the museum, the Concert Postscriptum will be held, a well-known pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, will perform the popouri of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Woznesen Davydov Desert, the bells of the workshop Ilia Drozdyhina, the students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy of the names of the Gnesichni, the artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Czech Studio".
auctions were held for the visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with a marathon logo were organized.
The Melihovo Museum Commander took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance 15 July a single day of charity in all the Podmozkova museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zitomirsk district near the local football stadium shot several times towards the adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was irritated by the noise, reported by FACTAM in the Zitomir Police Communications Department.
After that, the man went to a café nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used a rubber bullet device to hurt one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there was no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter was still in hiding.
The law enforcement authorities established his identity and detained him on the same day on 2 August.
A man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a disengagement of the rubber bullet device that's been sent to the lab.
Criminal proceedings under article 296 (Hooliganism) of the Criminal Code have been initiated under this fact.
The detainee is at risk of imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Remember, in Kiev, Lukyanovka, near Tatar Street, on the night of 28 July, there was an attack with a gunfire.
I object to Michel Carter for the reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide.
The liver of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for causing the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months behind bars and another five years on probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Father Roya said at the hearings on Thursday: "My family was killed with grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and a creamy blouse, listened to the sentence of the stand, chewing his hands and putting his eyes down.
"In her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show remorse."
But lawyer Carter said it was a "tragic case she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a marked effect on her actions”.
The D.A. read out Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement, saying, "it hasn't been a day since I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I'm doing it - I'm trying to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was always haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to become a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that provides for the responsibility of counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the whole country when it became known that it had been pushed into the suicide of Carter.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and he told her not to talk to the press to let her get what she wanted.
The lawyers differed on this.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murdering her British roommate in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her own special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: “Michel Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prison.”
Eugene Bogchev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight."
One of the best basketball players in the World Trade Organization, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNIKS.
U.S. defender Ivestim commented on the resignation of the President of UNIKSa Evgeny Bogchev.
Keith made the decision under family circumstances, said Evgeny Bogchev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played at UNIKSE for three seasons, and in each match he showed a high level, he taught 100%.
That's why I let him go like a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his playing career.
Keith Langford played at the Kazan Club for three years, winning the Single League silver-2015/16.
During the season of 2016/17, he received the award of the most successful Eurolyga season.
He scored 21.75 points on average for a match.
The result has been the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolyga to win the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with Chengchen, Eurohoops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second in July to be the second star of the Euroleague, who will move to the Chinese championship.
In the past, Jannis Burusis, an ex-centred Panatinaikosa, was transferred to the Chinese CBA.
A sunburned tourist from Podmaskova was evacuated by helicopter in Adige
Today, the Adigean rescuers evacuated from the mountainous region of the underwater tourist, who had received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested at the Fist shelter, located at a height of 1,6,000 feet [1,6,000 m].
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the man had been burned on the march.
Audi has to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that it would be proposed to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman, BMW, said that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is located, which considered the possibility of banning or restricting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Thursday that he is modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their turnout.
European auto-producers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But nitrogen oxides, which release diesel engines, are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost for auto-producers of equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhaust is also increasing, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German auto-producers are under close attention, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Government has also accused it of encouraging influential auto-producers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the error of Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called “damage devices”, which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted in order to comply with the rules and would be disabled under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders were convicted and the rest were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore unprotected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a disproportionately high share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, the visitor paid with false money
The police received a report from a bank employee on the detection of money from a general inquiry of 5,000 rubles of suspicious currency.
A study carried out at the Centre of Experts on Crime revealed that it was a false one.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Astrakhan Region, the bank note paid off one of the coffee visitors who bought the scarf.
It is worth noting that the register was not equipped with a tool to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Police officers are currently designated to be involved in the manufacture and marketing of a well-known fake CB ticket to the RF.
Such offences shall be punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful in financial transactions; it is recommended that trade facilities be installed to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found an "adama" planet on which even iron can swim
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which could evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have pointed out that water molecules are so heated by starlight that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope sealed the light of the water molecules on this gas giant, which makes the water in the planet's atmosphere light up in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called “hot Jupiters” — gas giants of size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year, only 1.3 “earthly” days last on the exoplanet, and its gas cover is scaled up to nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but now fears are being voiced that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of the dry weather and the disease of insects; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lavanda is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has been affected by climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn of the rains, it has become much smaller.
This affects the life expectancy of lavender.
And there's still little cicadas jumping through the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they're getting very much."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "We have small, underdeveloped, weakened or missing instead of very long circles with many large colors.
That's why we have fewer parts of air oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improved water distribution and soil evaporation slowing, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and removing varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador Winter University-2019 met with eloquent schoolchildren
The two-time hockey world champion Alexander Semin met with the beginning hockey players and gave autographs to the sick.
The meeting was held in the Winter University tent in 2019 as part of a thematic week devoted to hockey with Shibai.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on horseback on an artificial ice field.
In addition, estaphets, quizzes and games were organized with the game of student souvenirs, away from the aerobics federation.
Fifty schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible in sports venues and stressed that the most important in the early stages of schooling was hard work and a great desire to play hockey.
“It’s good that there’s a place in Krasnoyarsk such as the Winter University Tent 2019, where beginners can directly ask the team’s coaches questions,” said the champion.
Let us note that Ambassadors of the Winter Universities for the 1990s are helping to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among the red-haired.
The university tent will operate throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University Directorate's press service.
The words of Medvedev were commented on in Gosdep
The official representative of the US Department of State, Heather Nauert, commented at the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found “to improve bilateral interaction”.
Nauert referred to the Syria Armistice Agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said so, she has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of Gospep.
Previously, the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on a new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, said that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that United States sanctions would take place for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the U.S. Attorney-General, considers Trump to be a clean slate.
The missing bodybuilder in Podmöskov was found in a stranger's memory.
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very spicy circumstances: he stepped out of the car lounge to go to the bathroom.
He was unsuccessfully searched for seven days by acquaintances and locals.
And Shamil was found in a stranger's house in Ramensky.
He was found completely naked in his master's bathroom.
A Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport went missing.
I.D.'s helped us find out about his disappearance.
The doctors on the phone recorded Hanmetov's partial memory loss and cranial trauma, reports Mash.
Perhaps other surprises await the athletes.
The perpetrators of the kidnapping of Shamil likely had already visited his apartment, from which he had also stolen the keys.
July oil revenues exceeded projected at 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, oil revenues from July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion roubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The exceedance, according to the Department, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the US dollar to ruble than the average monthly value of June used for the evaluation, as well as to an excess of actual gas production and exports of petroleum products at the projected levels.
“Deviation of federal oil revenues from the monthly assessment, in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019, is projected at +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017,” says Minfina.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated to the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is Rs. 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would amount to an equivalent of 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchase operations.
Each working day during that period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases at organized Moscow Stock Exchange auctions evenly during a trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the Federal Treasury account in the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Members of the weekly Riodose newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the continuing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to discuss security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking their children with them to an office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in a room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the Government or the cartels, a whole list of teenagers who make the work of lighting up chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not provide a break, and more and more journalists have been living in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nyeto took office in December 2012; 589 after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have been killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of the Riodose Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” wrote Valdes in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence is widespread, a large photograph of Valdes showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smile, face in the glasses or his firm Panama.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists are discussing their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime killings committed each year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed with grief, although it is much more dangerous around them now.
Without information on the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's really stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdés left the Riodos office in the capital city of Kuliacana.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelveth River".
The shooter drove off on his car and smashed it near here.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He's got a wife and two grown-ups left.
Rumors usually vary rapidly in Kuliacan.
But there's virtually nothing about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill a vacuum.
Let us not say that every day in the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with two-storey mausoleum drug kings that are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's just forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels is taking control of the coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorace, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of the Riodos, was overwhelmed by guilt over not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped kill him.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel faction who is fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication may have angered the sons; the people who allegedly were members of the gang bought all the copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been captured, which had written about the same story.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He walked away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest, and in 2003, he and his five colleagues founded Riodos, selling their $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without affecting the topic of drugs," Bohorace said.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of bold and honest publication, sales, and advertising.
Journalists liked to be able to publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but readers were attracted to the fact that they could read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after her foundation, Riodose won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for Reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for the bravery of investigating Mexico's drug trade, wherever it goes.
He honestly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the award of the CPJ.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "this way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompiento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that you have to face as a journalist, either that or you're just lying to a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around here... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodos miss Valdes, a joker who scolded like a cargoman in a port, a friend who was generous with arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to stand in the living.
They relied on his order.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Did he lose his love for the once established order?
His death caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know their wives, their children, their legal business, and underground airports for drug transport.
"These things have been over the line," said Bohorace.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says editor Riodose Andres Villareal, is that "sniffing can be deceived... and that's when what happens to Javier happens."
The old rules, he said and others, are no longer in force in Sinaloa - like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of incoming smuggling routes, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
In a room where Riodos gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to use cell phones: a few days earlier, it was known that spy programmes sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers are hiding in the shade of a 104-degree fire (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliacan.
Some journalists were half-wittingly asking whether these police officers included 50 per cent of the order that the Governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto controlled by drug traffickers.
In the immediate issue of Riodos, there were three main topics.
It's a murder at Sinaloa's brother's former boxing champion Julio Cézar Chavez.
They also had disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the Governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group abduction of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliacan, a neighborhood from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when the time came to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time of drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from the open databases that the restaurant had been registered to a policy of the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which had dominated at all levels of power for almost the past century.
A number of PRI governors have recently been charged with gross corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when Guzman's son, El Chapo, slipped away from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have looked for a column of Valdes with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"We would sooner know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdes's office is now being used as a poster and sticker warehouse to protest the killings of journalists because the staff became what they never thought they would become: activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to demonstrate to another journalist.
El Salvador Adama disappeared in Michoakan State in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists were loud, protesting and writing SOS Press on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorace was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support for the requirement of justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering them to kill for telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to be given more tasks to publicize the Government ' s activities, fearing that the anger would damage its objectivity.
Valdés said many times that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, “Drug Journalists”, he wrote that reporters were not merely killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they did so on the orders of politicians and security services in conspiring with organized crime.
The “Article 19” Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out at the order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, allegedly written from the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close down as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent, Miroslav Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to behave like El Manjana from Nuevo Laredo after the killing of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to see danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra -- who once dreamed of being a poet -- admits that he's afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last edition was ready for the press, the publishers of the Riodos sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of gunfights between rival gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 bodies behind.
The war continued to unfold, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put news on the Riodos website on their cell phone.
The next day, the first page was to be reworked.
The sirens came up, another gunfire in the vicinity.
Bohorace saw if the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at all.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on the attention of all Sinaloa, the Riodos continued his work.
"How can you think of closing yourself," said Bohorace, "if the day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though horrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino, discovered by a Canadian miner, remained so well that experts called it "Mono Lisa Among Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his combed skin was eloquent and brown - and to say that he had, in some ways, a “dark past”.
The report, published in the journal Modern Biology, described it as “the most well-preserved of Tyreofor in the history of discovery and one of the best copies of dinosaurs in the world. ”
This is a recently discovered copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the mill, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has bewildered researchers who call it “extremely wonderful”.
This herbivorous tireophorus is the most well - preserved fossil of this species in the history of discovery, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millenium mine of the company Sankor near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the environment and decided to look more closely.
The fossil they discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was done to detect an animal inside the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It is only a matter of getting a little sleepy, and you can almost believe that he is asleep,” said author-in-chief Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with shells and resembled a walking tank, it appeared to have been greatly endangered by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to adapt faster to the environment and avoid meeting with his enemies, experts say, assuming that larger dinosaurs were hunting him.
This substance, 110 million years old, belonging to the family of nodosaurs, was widely reported in the press in May, and is now at an exhibition at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory Mark Mitchell, a member of a group that spent more than 7,000 hours digging it.
The remarkable preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the painting and the form of garlic and bulletproof plates on his body.
They discovered a protective paint, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker on its lower side.
Although the protective colouring is well distributed, the discovery has become unexpected because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly greater than the size of the present protected animals.
It may be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But the majority of modern animals with protective colouring — such as deer, zebras, or armoured animals — are of a much smaller size and are more accessible prey, indicating that nodosaurs had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, powerful armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mel period were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the Czech dinosaur also indicates that its skin should have been eloquent and brown.
Scientists continue to study animals, searching for information about his life, including the content of his food tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and with his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it was in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to have spread far further into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it will be completely covered with the preserved silky skin and, at the same time, has been completely preserved in three dimensions while preserving the original form of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did in the Early Melo period.
It is not particularly necessary to resort to imagination in order to recreate it, it is only worth a little bit of peeing, and you can almost believe that it is asleep.”
The Melian period is an era when giant terrors, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his ugly ancestors may have hunted the tireofor.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) long, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in the ile.
The substance was found by Sean Funk when he was working on the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum officials, this is the most well-preserved tireophorus in the world, along with the skin and the vest, and it is the target, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (5 m) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two 20-inch rods from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous tireophorus has been difficult to climb because it is now Canada until the spilly river has taken it out into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his vest with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin are still covering the bulwark plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic, this degree of security is “rare than winning a lottery. ”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossils of the skin still cover the buffalo’s armored plates that soak up the animal’s skull.
His right fore leg is stretched out along his side, five fingers pointing up on it.
I can count the scratches on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili made it to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, former head of Georgia and then of the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Television Republic, which posted video on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the celebration of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland and also spoke of Ukraine.
An opal politician learned that the Ukrainian Migration Service had deprived him of his citizenship while in the United States.
Just how he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former Governor of the Odessa Region, Mikhail Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the Ukrainian citizenship survey had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any questionnaires.
The investigation period for Weinziher and Olhovik was extended until January
The preliminary investigation into the case of the owner of the Renova group Evgenia Olhovik and the head of the energy holding company, T Plus, Boris Weinziher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmann Court considered the extension of the accused ' s home arrest.
The representative of the SC reported at the meeting on the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The specific complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need for the seizure and analysis of a large number of documents, as well as the conduct of investigations in the territory of several RF entities”, the investigator said.
He added that suspects regularly paid bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at no less than one billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovic, as well as the former head of the ZAO, Mikhail Slobodan, who headed the company by 5 September, paid bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for setting maximum benefits for heat and electricity tariffs, as well as for creating favourable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olkhovic were detained, staged in Siktivkar and arrested for two months, and Slobodan fled the investigation and was announced for federal search.
How did one activist find the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken to the heart.
Only one day after arriving in New York, a St. Louis resident sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, viewing a Facebook tape on the phone.
She ran into someone in high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that none of her tape ever picked up that information, puzzled, she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
There was a lot of repositions in her tape with no @TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from Big St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the middle of the street, where it would be for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and then later tonight she went back to tweeting that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a warning tape and screaming people and a man claiming that he was the father of Brown, who was crying, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
On another video, another policeman said, "I will kill you all, animals!"
“This is a non-standard situation”, Ferrell said, on her own memory.
"It's not a murder like the ones we're used to, and we can call them typical.
At that moment, I felt a snooze.
I was angry and I was crying."
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the theme of the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on the screens on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and perseverance from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flower and a wreath under a color, they remembered the conversation she had had had before this morning countless times, “about the experience of black people and their situation”.
She said, "Do you remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
"I couldn't help it," Ferrel said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and learn about it.
It must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand different levels of black experience and their situation and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can get her a Wednesday where she won't face the obvious racism herself, she's no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do her a bad favor if I could protect her from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, on a site across the road from a police station that became sort of a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the final non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson
There Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped give them to protestors.
Farrell has become a new type of activism in his mind.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August”, she said, noting that, as a student of the University of Missouri-Saint-Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and inequality in health among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
This has come on its own.”
A few weeks later, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of her directors at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, simply wanted to document the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can play on?"
This skepticism has been fueled by numerous people, often whites, who have come to the community to benefit from its pain and perseverance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently.”
Follayan had already joined his director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on death row.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the Ferrell project and six local residents, with whom the “Whose Streets?” project team maintained contact over the years following the murder of Brown.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“This was most important to me, as these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented.”
Although the aim of the project was not to focus at all on the experience of Ferrel, in an effort to show that the movement “not on the rescue leader, but on how the community unites,” Folayan said, proved to be the most open of the participants.
As a result, the “Whose Streets?” shows suddenly the personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” said Ferrel, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
“But I realized that when you do this job and you humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the story of Ferrel again discusses and highlights the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social networks after the murder of a black teenager named Travon Martin in 2012 -- are considered homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in decision-making positions support all this movement,” says Ferrel. “Because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Follayan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it came first, because when"
You can feel it's energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, cinemas have long been missing in Ferguson, but there are complex racial links between the community and the police.
Farrell will be on probation for two and a half years for crossing the road during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which it calls home, simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding onto the speech she learned when she went out on Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players disqualified for US players
The football players in El Salvador, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, received long-term disqualifications for non-sporting behaviour.
During the four-final match of the Gold Cup of the North and Central American Confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAAF), the Salvadorans bit American players.
Henry Romero was the first to stand out.
The El Salvadoran bit the assaulting Josie Altidore, then pinched him by the chest.
Then, when placing the corner in the penal area, the U.S. defender Omar González bit it.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American win with a score of 2:0, broadcasts Goal.com.
Similarity: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
At the center of the Freedman Gallery in New York, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all of which are undetectable.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheeks and hair clips sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth Prison where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a woman transsexual and prominent dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted only three days before the end of his presidency.
Using the computerized DNA program obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who could be with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg has created a deep, though difficult, manifesto on not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting it and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, born Bradley Edward, but since she was a teenager, has openly said that she thinks she is a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos were not available in the prison, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which Manning, in platinum shade of wig, apparently feeling uncomfortable, was sitting behind the wheel of a car; with this photograph she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project, Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of court evidence of a type of cucumber and chewing gum, removing DNA from the garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey Hagborg explained in a preliminary presentation of a new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this way, the artist and her prison muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book entitled "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoila Kanungo, who illustrated how the President would mitigate Chelsea's sentence in the future and would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
Obama’s decision to release Manning only a few days after the book came out in the light proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful about the opening of the exhibition right now when Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to stir up the hostility he's going to unleash on Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of it all over time, she said that there was nothing by chance.
In a statement by an artist written on the gallery wall, the huge signature of Manning below (with a heart instead of a point above "i" in her name) calls for an end to “automatic division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from the pendulum C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a science-encouraging artist) Dewey Harborg hoped to show how amazingly similar we are, in any case, to our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how much genetic data is open for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 "Floor Memories" video is also shown here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition placed in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
It features King Kong-style Manning over the U.S. Correctional Fair building with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says an artist who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - as illustrated in comic books - but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulators, gathered as if by a crowd of protesters.
This is also done on purpose, as is everyone in the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning growth) on which the granite gaplogroups were drawn.
"I'd rather hang them on the walls, but right now I wanted them to look like a bunch of people," says Dewey-Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of North West University and Oxford University are looking for police on murder charges
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor of the North West University and an Oxford University staff member who is being sought as suspects because a man was found in a luxury room in Chicago to kill a man.
According to the Cook County Court records, arrest warrants were issued Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on the bail of 40-year-old Vindem Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after being subjected to multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza suite and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of a knife wound, viewing it as murder, while the police are searching for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to enter the North-West University campus.
“Now this is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the North West University is cooperating with the investigation”, Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have spoken with the British police and are prepared to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigation authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Chief Anthony Gulelmi said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing”, Gulelmi said.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the superintendent of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the video camera records confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were linked to each other,” Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza manual issued a call to residents reporting: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the road map of VADA as soon as possible"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) established for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be met shortly.
“A certain stage in the fulfilment of the requirements has been completed, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and run tests in conjunction with UKAD (British Anti-Doping Agency).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map to restore compliance status to the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that might present a complication for Russia.
“All has been announced, all will be accomplished.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of an investigation commissioned by VADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that dumping in Russian sports was controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no State programmes, and we will not acknowledge what was not."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnov, Head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication “Rsport” Smirnov recognized the problems encountered earlier in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain contentious positions and provisions.
There is absolutely no need for this report to be accepted," Smirnov added.
VADA removed RUSADA from the doping controls in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, Director-General VADA Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to resume its work.
Cease fire in 79th floor tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, is being swept away by Reuters.
It is noted that the fire department has managed to cope with all fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 msc).
Local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscrapers were blocked.
The reasons for the incident are not yet known.
Previously, it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was burning in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable set of Booze Shakes of Worshipers: Underpants not covering underpants
The scandalous "Dom-2" reality show, Olga Buzowa, struck the audience at the Europa Plus Live festival with the dancing of rabbits.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the new Nasty Kudri duo singer performed the song "We're Gonna Be Hot."
Both girls went on stage in provocative pants, sewn in such a way that the lower underwear of the singers appeared.
Buzova and Kudry were on their pants.
Previously, changes in the appearance of Buzowa were reported by a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg recognized the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported this with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO's Gensek also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was nevertheless possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerously low level and accused the American Congress of doing so.
Ekaterinburg Metro is winning a new way of paying
In October, a trip to the Ekaterinburg metropolis could be paid for by bank card, said Director Paul Vedernikov, OAO Director of the I-Network, in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce to the World Cup of Football 2018 the same system of subway fares as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirske.
“We want the patients from other countries, the guests of the Mundials, to use the metropolitan with their bank cards without acquiring tokens or standing in line,” he said.
Start-ups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her e-commerce startup, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who manages a 75-person San Francisco company called Madison Reed, which deals in electronic hair care.
She therefore sought help from others.
There is now a new type of staff start-up that helps companies to find out how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to conduct express interviews, contact certain teams and demographic groups, offer anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to bypass top management and address the Directorate directly.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett said that she had reached a greater understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of using Glint.
In addition to express requests and questionnaires of certain commands, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in an illustrative form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are well aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, who was involved in a scandal when a former employee published a post on a blog that described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation, an opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internet portal “Let’s talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry can cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent launch from Denver, Colorado, to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the face of the downfall of Ubera's reputation.
The Convergence has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among the clients.
Like “Glint”, “Convercent” allows companies to send personal interviews of staff, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view heat maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the director's office.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors”, said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Konvercent.
If it is found that the company is ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspector is not intervened, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 facilities, has been using Konvercent for over a year to make sure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for the telephone number or e-mail address of the head office, file an official complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Konvercent service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, prejudice and unfair pay — can be found and dealt with more quickly.
“I can get closer to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff”, said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from trials with staff.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values and involvement of employees more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen, an accountant, suffered a breakdown due to ethical violations resulting from Enron.
But only when “social networks became widespread” did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution online.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy”, he said.
Both “Glint” and “Convercent” offer their software as a service, taking regular fees from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity approved by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Konvercent received $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in total company capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today ' s staff expect more from their jobs than was previously the case.
In highly competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, only the necessary minimum.
The staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are hearing them, and that the work they are doing is the result, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Converter and Glint are used.
Investors receive income when business from their portfolio goes well; business goes well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's guardians take action.
In fact, if the company asks staff for feedback, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
And if change does not occur quickly enough or not at all, frustration may develop, and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Ratt, president of Kotter International management firm, who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you do not go to the end, the staff will say, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
If you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff interviews, is able to take action the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And after collecting feedback from staff members who were unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help her to keep staff in a sector known for its high turnover.
"If you are not trying to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
Barnaul opens a new asphalt on the Red Army Avenue.
Barnaul has taken major measures to address the cause of the asphalt failure on the Red Army prospectus.
The place where the two holes were created on the newly paved roadway (the intersection with Youth Street) is decided to “open up”.
Recall, the destruction of a small section of the road near the tramway was due to the fact that the land in the area of a landless unexploded network had been cleared.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out to address the demolition preconditions.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that there will be a need for the recovery and concrete of the robbery of landless communications.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
Commander Bruins has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled the training twice a day.
The time is approaching 11 p.m.; a crowd of California University football players in Los Angeles are being delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the camp team.
Some of them took off their T - shirts, wearing their backs shiny from the sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many players, these idle minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will return to dormitories after three hours of training to prepare for final exams and return to the Vassarman Football Center at 6:30 a.m.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, the coach of the team, Bruins Jim Morra, said: "In the next three days, these boys are waiting for meatballs."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually prolonged their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the first three training sessions of the University of California in Los Angeles were scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be placed in the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings per day was the higher number of days with one training, and Bruins is starting the camp almost a week from last year and training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 trainings to be conducted by 20 August inclusive before they begin official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another point had emerged in the players ' schedule.
“In three or four days we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious test,” said Mora.
"And they just overcame it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live to Saturday and have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, since its fields are directly visible from the nearby parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Centre, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed with footballs that have overcome the security net behind the gates.
Bruins players have to take over the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We’ll have security,” said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can take the room down, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a video of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and there'll be security in parking lot number eight.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the attack in Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All victims of the St. Petersburg subway attack were discharged from hospitals in April.
This has been reported to the press by Deputy Governor Anna Mitjanina.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left at the stations, broadcast by the TV Centre.
To remind you, the explosion in St. Petersburg Metro took place on 3 April this year.
The bomb was blown up by a suicide bomber named Akbarjon Jallylov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In a criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Azimov, were arrested.
As a reminder, Rosobrenadzover recommended that the Metropolitan of Petersburg review the plan of transport security activities, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fairy tale news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mysticism, independent experts, and show them under original posts, the world's largest social network, which tries to combat so-called fairy news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible misstatements, send them to check and possibly show the results of the check-up under the baseline.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fairy tale news, which many believe has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the May presidential elections, and in Germany, before the September elections, expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they did not quickly remove hate-inciting posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what reports are challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook News Manager, in her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the “related articles” function and work on other changes in the news tape to solve the problem of fairy tale news.
Create a novel comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called Squeeze, and in the '70s and '80s, it served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bule Valley in Kent County, he watched a turbulent history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with land of hair and a propensity for historical documents, on a novel comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
The castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells of families who lived in Scottney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories", a collection of British Library documents; the project suddenly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could have just had a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he relates.
"It's a fingerprint of his finger."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because at the time the lights were lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person affected by such a passion for old papers, receiving support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“Frequently, I have had a bit of a meal there”), it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the “new” Victorian castle for days, went through the archives, and looked at numerous treasures of wealth and old things, such as the heads of genes on walls or bottles that have been in the trench for centuries.
He walked in the park and in the ruins of the old castle, talked to the woodsheds, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The story of the Scotty Castle is not very studied because the National Fund was fully accessible only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to deal with the archive he described as “the fact that the aristocrats had fallen to their hearts for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned it, "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, but there were two families fighting on the beach.
That's what happens, guys!"
In some of the stories of the castle's collection, it becomes a starting point for wider exploration in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Christian Revolution.
“There are reports of a rebellion that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called the "Rich families of Kent and Sassex," says Rhodes.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was the right start.
Were they connected?"
Other stories are strongly related to the history of the castle, such as the Priest, which tells of the Jesuit priest whose family had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabander", of the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funerals by filling the grave with stones (this was discovered several years later when the grave was dug).
The Darrells are the beloved family of the Rhodes of all who inhabited Scotty: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect scoundrel, forever in debt and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In various generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I think of them as a company of cute guys who can look after the heirs of great fortunes."
After finishing work at the Rhodes Castle, there are other opportunities to gain unique written experience.
He lived for two weeks in Finnish deafness, where he wrote a graphic novel about the Elemymans, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew up again in the woods.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: God damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen major banks choose Russia
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sbergbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave the public organization.
Thus, the exit from the ARB will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just a solution -- all the banks that claimed to break up with the ARB are negotiating with another public credit institution, the Association of Regional Banks Russia, led by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee of the Gosduma, recognized as a result of the last session and the most effective head of the Committee of Thought and the MP on the number of bills drafted.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was the debate in the Council of the Federation when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular, providing for a new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that the Association believed that the bill was being adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which thus tried to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clientele.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which is true of the CB representative: many of the leaders of the affected banks, in particular the Foreign Trade Bank, were included in the ARB governing bodies.
It appears that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the Chief Banking Regulator and is a visible reason for the 15 largest banks, in disagreement with the ARB policy, to begin to prepare for the Russian Federation association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work will be low and that constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out”.
Donors will be better off
What's the end of this?
Let us immediately answer the main question that arises when a minor malfunction or a conflict in the banking field or next to it: investors will not be threatened, rather, by the fact that the banking system will be more reliable.
Headed by “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, known for his own sensitivity to all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional highly valued in the Centrebank: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert evaluations of “regions”.
There are obviously no special shocks in the staffing and organizational plan.
There is no doubt that the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants have been deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, there is considerable potential in this oldest organization, established in 1991, for the interests of the banking community to continue to improve banking legislation and monetary treatment as a whole.
It cannot be said that even in Russia's extended arms association, new members are willing to accept under any conditions, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova ("may want too much"), who, on 21 July, in a briefing at the Parliamentary newspaper's press centre, said that “literally the next day, the representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider increasing the potential of our association, Russia”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the vote of bankers on the Association Council and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, proposals by both sides are being examined, an extraordinary meeting of the association is being prepared to be held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll determine.
Anatoly Aksakov, underlining that “the chair is not being held”, also called the possible new leader of the updated association “Russia” Georgi Luntowski, who leaves the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, highly characterized by his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to interrupt vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary Russian Congress.
The entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
Deputy head of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered vehicles into Russia's major cities would not be limited yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually improve the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think technically we're ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's the same at the slogan level, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
We're gonna close the whole town down?
"In 20 years -- I don't know if that's what's going to happen," says the Prime Minister's words.
Earlier, the newspaper Ivestija reported that, by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovic had been tasked with examining the possible options for electric transport, submitted to the Government by the Director-General of PAO Kamaz Sergey Cogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, are the use of DAF vehicles in large cities and resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for the Green Card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new United States immigration plan would be adopted to change the rules for receiving the Green Card.
The plan reduces the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so against a change in the way the United States issues Grincards to nationals of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give preference to candidates who own English, have money to support themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
We have not been able to think that 2017 can no longer get worse, a new report on technological success in sex robots has been released.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now at the centre of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharka, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we will soon see a lot more of them," Sharky said in a presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable collectives into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas managed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “adjust” their robots according to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the juices of the robot to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personal personality" that Stepford's wife would appear to be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to adjust the quality they find attractive in robots, such as shyness.
There are other Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, that are delivered with an individual already programmed - for example, Cold Farra makes an impression of shyness, and Dickia Wendy has a bold character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours beautifully," says True Companion.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in a mood!
In the emergence of sex robots, much is of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape that causes cold (read: resisting) Fara.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, for men only.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards wanting sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men will certainly not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots came about at a time when women's rights around the world were threatened when the President was in the White House, who boasted of joining women.
The scariest part of the TV series "The Story of the Servant" is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and eyes out, that's how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem that big.
The objective of the sex robots industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with porno-star proportions) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look human to the point of copying the movements of the human body.
But it's their "characters" that robots don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They have neither their lives nor their biography -- nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles national Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been in favour of a compulsive Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national basketball team in Europe, the final part of which begins on 31 August.
In an interview with BeBasket, Andrey Lebedev, the general manager of the Blue-Yellow portal reported this.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Remember, with Jeter's direct involvement, the compulsive Ukraine took a record sixth place in Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time won the world basketball championship, where the Yellow-Blues were unable to overcome the group stage and the U.S. national scored 15.4 points on average, made 3 picks and gave 5 passes.
Jeter stopped his campaign for Ukraine since leaving the post of head coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
Eurobasket will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its group tournament on Earth as promised.
The Trustees of Eugenia Murzin will have five individuals in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team conducted two control teams, which gave way to Dutch and Belarusians.
A great feat of Trump?
It seems very reasonable to pretend to be Mit Romney.
In the Trump era, it was common that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate on the microlevel had broken some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers spent columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all tense so we're gonna hit it.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-handed views of a poet from Chicago who was long on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the alliance against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, including the Republican brother with whom she had disputed the policy for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
After dinner, that's certainly good; but I can't help thinking that in a broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has inhaled force into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can push us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll be stopped from hurting him.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing republicans, who will suddenly show a pattern of common sense against the background of his standards.
I realized that I miss Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 per cent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Trump and that, and the other seems like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park -- the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't want caffeine.
The bad guys are ugly and huge, the pictures of the glass fiber on the central drum - the grinning clowns and the animals, who bend away and stare at their backs in horror - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, as strangely as it is, excites them.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: species from the skyscrapers are getting old, buildings silhouettes are being taken too much to cause tremor, and the reality of the city is not working out for the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day that I found out that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss scarf. It's a big intersection in North London.
And a carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven and two women of forty can have an excellent time.
If I could put the carousel together, I'd put in a five, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the university this week, I was asked before holding a terminal card to evaluate my one-to-five-star shopping experience.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's still the same plus option to make a 15-percent cup of tea for a standing order.
As a result, not only is there a slowing down of neutrality in the idea of interaction, but there is also a need to take a personal approach to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor shop girl at the university smiled confusedly while I was tired of appreciating my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pains
Pistorius is leaving prison for a second visit to a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration said he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of wilful murder following the prosecution ' s appeal to the initial conviction for involuntary murder.
He killed Steencamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the bathroom in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius stated that he had accepted his friend as a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Prosecutor ' s Office stated that it intended to protest again, this time against the six-year period of Prettorius, which it said was too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The period of Pretorias may increase by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-departure subscription has been selected for a suspected NTV journalist who was beaten by a journalist
Capital law enforcement has chosen a measure of suppression in the form of a signature of non-departure for a man who attacked a journalist of the NTV channel, Nikita Razvodzhev, during a direct air from Goryke Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Volk.
“As part of an investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code (“Blows”) against a 32-year-old man who struck a television channel in the Central Cultural Park and the rest of the name of Goryko, the suspect was selected to sign a non-refoulement and conduct”.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up for the suspect ' s failure to comply with the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct air of the WDV Day, an incoherent man approached the correspondent and struck him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully had nothing to do with the VAT.
On the contrary, they tried to detain the Moscow.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the BBC, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, reports the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 1 August, a group of people who placed tents in an uninhabited place, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC network that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the control of free campsites and have already imposed serious fines on all those caught while parked in a place not intended for this purpose.
The inspections will take place throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russia's M.I.A. accused the US Vice President of the cold war rhetoric
Statements made during the US Vice-President Michael Penz's European tour have been criticized by the Russian MIDA.
“It has to be noted with regret that Washington is getting deeper and deeper into the primitive ideologies of the cold war era, which is completely alienated from reality,” says a statement by the Russian foreign policy agency.
Thus, Pensa's words about the Russian threat and attempts to force a border crossing in Podgorica were responded to in the MID.
The Russian MlD pointed to the destructive choice of either “with the West or with Russia” and the invisibility of the idea of the alleged non-alternative accession of the whole of South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to dissuade Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to stop the stigmatization of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual interest”, says a statement by the Russian MIDA.
Feldsher was injured in an ambulance in Podmozkovje
The accident occurred in Stupino, which resulted in a collision of a foreigner with the ambulance "Early Assistance" by Feldsher.
Today, about 08.10 msk was hit by a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the town of Stupino Moscow.
“As a result of the collision, the fast car has turned over,” said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow.
There are law enforcement officers on the scene, and the circumstances of the incident are clear.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son away at the construction site, turning him into a cellophane package.
On the evening of 3 August, a package with a baby was reported to the Police Department of Splitnjan from a local resident that he had found in an unfurnished private house.
“The scene was visited by law enforcement officers and doctors who rushed the child to a medical facility”, reported the Odessa chapter of the National Police.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before he was found, as shown by the presence of the umbilical cord.
Priority operational investigations identified the birth mother as a 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been found that a woman has three other minors.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously been involved in law enforcement and had not been included in a special account.
The circumstances and reasons offered by the police to the woman in question are currently being established, followed by a procedural decision.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolayev threw her unborn child into a garbage disposal.
Gregory Lepps: "I'm fighting, but 55 isn't 30."
One of Russia's most successful artists, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary in the coming Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer spoke to the observer of the News.
I remember when your "politeman" was mentioned.
The special tent in the Locusts, Gloria Geynor sang for the noun, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five years.
Plans come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I've worked hard, I've traveled around the country three times, I've given 120-130 concerts a year.
I've released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not what we say 20 years ago.
You can't fool biological clocks.
The way I sang in my 30s, it's getting heavy.
But I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them, you write a new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
In fact, we've already recorded it in my studio and now we're sending it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious about?" in a one-named song written with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get the video on it.
And the album will be presented in November for a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Chris Coleman, a great American drummer, attached his hand to your new record.
You think you wanted to bring him into your gastronomics?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put out, gently speaking, excessive conditions.
It was about the fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
That's when I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malishev.
It is best to feed your own.
Sometimes I want to hit on one of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
It is written in Western music magazines, invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wy, after listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with other performers."
Your album is in Los Angeles, and American musicians are cooperating with you, but you still can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers working on this issue.
As a musician, I'm truly sorry I can't make it to America.
I've told you I'm studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumber than they are, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our performers of popular music were completely out of line with what American musicians had always done.
They were trying to make the most of it.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to file visa papers with the British Embassy every year to be allowed to go there again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe treats me kindly.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not an appointment, but an affidavit, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sports Hall in Monte Carlo. I've been there before.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already been sold out.
On "Randeva Lyma Wykule", which will begin on July 20th in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who can present herself with both a beautiful voice and even a whisper.
After the tours and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you're going to turn to Vladimir High once.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record about 80 or 90 High songs on the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov, will be joining me.
I'm going to try to get Alexander Jakovlevich Rosenbaum on the album.
I've talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Grebenczykov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you record his album later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I crossed him several times and asked him, "Can I sing one of his songs?"
He said, "Grigorius, I write songs so that they may be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to record an album like this.
As long as I don't have a job like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't object, I might make a project like this.
Unless you focus entirely on the work of your production center.
I take it you haven't yet realized its potential, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, they're people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has a development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayotov in my center, who I used to run in Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
He'll be truly sorry if he doesn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm shooting videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they'll get a recorded album, a couple of videos.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist on them returning the money they have invested in them.
Although I'd be happy if one of them made a commercial success and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover anybody's oxygen.
Let them all work, break through, prove as I once did.
If tomorrow you're offered a tour of Ukraine and you're guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
These are mostly private activities.
And as for the big round...
I am a Russian man of my country, flying to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they say we have to go somewhere else for the sake of the State, I'll take it.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I truly regret that we have had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry it's not gonna work out, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 or 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he worked with several Ukrainian artists: Annie Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a mass of gifted people, and it is truly unfortunate that they cannot now fully mold their talent towards the Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite a great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slav Wakarchuk, and to perform a concert with him.
But I don't think it's likely right now...
Andrea Ohlopkova was transferred from the cosmodrome
As "U" has become known, East Andrey Ohlopkov, Technical Director of the Cosmodrome, has started work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCPNC) called Hruničeva.
It had previously been de facto involved in the construction of the Eastern Cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), it had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow ' s Philosophers, where production coordination was carried out.
Mr. Ohlopkov's replacement will not be available: the position of technical director is likely to be abolished and the functional function is dispersed by the CENKI units.
The technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of the Technology Development Centre, Andrey Ohlopkov, moved to work at the Hrunichev HCPC, U told top managers of several space industries, as well as a government official.
"He's been working on a new post for weeks," the "U" interlocutors in the industry explained.
CENCI ' s operational comment was not available on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "U" was formally confirmed in the GCPD.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination - stated at the company. - Andrey Ohlopkov had completed his mission of ensuring a minimum launch for the first launch at the East Cosmodrome.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, serving behind his shoulders in space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesecka, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel at the North Cosmodrome.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it was alleged that regional merchants had received dispossessment orders from him but had failed to comply with the obligations made to clean up the separate parts of the carrier rockets in the Archangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in CENCI extended to various projects, but the main was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in his interview “U”, explicitly said that the situation in the East “was critical already in October 2013.
The planning error was a strategic one: completion of the construction and first launch of the Union-2.1 rocket were planned at the same time at the end of 2015.
In order to launch by the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadlines had been set aside from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it was necessary to resort to a trick: CIA specialists began parallel installation of technological equipment on undesigned facilities.
Andrey Ohlopkov was the main proponent of the idea.
Despite the risks and still the carryover that occurred (instead of December 2015, the Alliance only flew away on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "U" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have made any launch from the East, but we would have been engaged in construction".
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who was in charge of creating the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrey Ohlopkov his "space Susanine", but he almost always asked for information about the progress of the building.
Remember Mr. Ohlopkov and direct: for example, in interview "U", he suggested that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstro) be deprived of the status of the sole executive in the Eastern and directly working with subcontractors, "Why should we store all the eggs in one basket of Speczstrom?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibilities of the contractor-general to complete the construction and installation work planned in the fourth quarter.
According to U, the reasons for Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to a new place of work were disagreements with the CENKI leadership on how to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
In turn, a government official calls the decision odd: “He was one of the best professionals, finding him an equivalent replacement would not be easy.”
According to “U”, this will not be necessary: the post of the space director will be abolished and its functions will be abolished by the CIA units.
In music schools, there will be a two-training programme
In the future, children's music schools will be able to receive two courses at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Science and Education of Svetoslava Golubenko, for this can be re-readed to students, and the issue of paying for the other courses in the second profession can be resolved through special grants, referred to by RIA Novosti.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and together with the expert community, we will develop a mechanism that will allow us to pursue two professions, but at the same time will not conflict with existing legislation in the field of education”, said Dolubenko.
Last Friday, during the "Nedet Talk" by Vladimir Putin, a student from the Syrian Children's Centre, said that she had to pay for recurrent subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying in violin and piano classes and had awards for competitions in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian taken on the wall of a skyscraper
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Cyril N., who climbed the roof of a tall building, reports El Universal.
An incident occurred in Mexico City.
With the help of two unknown men, the young man crossed a three-meter fence into Nestle's office complex and went to one of his own towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
A young man has already been detained on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security has placed him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It reveals whether the boy is legally in the territory of the country.
In the meantime, the video with a young man in high school became popular on the Web.
The users called the young man a spider man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help facilitate KPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of intestinal inflammatory diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leads to cola and exhalation of the abdomen, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acids of triptphane protein contribute to the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestines are ensuring that harmful microbes from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of initiating an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protect the body, and do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severely impaired towards inflammation, this may lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice with certain bacteria in their intestines have an increased tolerance for cells.
And this bacteria needs triptphane, one of the building blocks of a protein, to trigger the emergence of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a single type of bacteria called Lactobacillus routeri, which is part of a normal gut microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptphane was contained in mouse nutrition, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. routers and a rich tryptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflamed environment in the intestine.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganas, studying the variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiomy of the intestines of the mice — the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of the mice was sequenced and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with immune cells but not in the mice without them.
The mice grown in a sterile environment that had no good microbioma and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. routers, and the immune cells appeared to them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. routers in a liquid environment and then carried small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells released from mice.
Immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptophane processing known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptphane in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptphane was halved, the number of cells also dropped twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerance for cells as mice, and most of us have L. routers in their gastric tract.
It is unknown whether triptophane by-products from L. routers contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but in humans suffering from inflammatory intestinal diseases, defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been detected.
She says, "We may need to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the internal surface of the intestines.

According to José Maureen, Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matic, according to José Mourinyu after the semi-deputy debuted in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A 40 million-pound player at Chelsea started winning 2-1 in Dublin in the last United pre-season match in front of the UEFA Supercup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression on the role of a half-deficit, while players like Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira made a breakthrough when they were blessed.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously short of preparations for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which Moorin said required further development before the start of the season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is how he thinks -- he thinks football," Moorin said.
“We will help him prepare sooner than later.”
Like Matic, his new teammates, Victor Lindeloff and Romelo Lukak, began the game at Aviv Stadium when Maureen began to form his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Maureen wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four," he added.
“I’ll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already worked hard for me.”
Former leaders of the social-democrats of Lithuania are urging them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-Prime Minister Algirdas Butkjawiczus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Sejm from Social Democrats, Cheslavas Jurschenas, called on the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliamentary Gazette reported, due to friction with partners - the Union of Farmers and Greens - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
Here are three senior experienced comrades who have addressed one party with an open letter, which states, inter alia: “It is understandable that the party's comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the “Christians” has created for us not too easy, but still conditions for the further realization of the objectives of social justice as set out in the Government's programme, on our initiative, and for maintaining the political domination of the left centre over the right parties.”
According to former party leaders, in the discussion so far “emotion-based expression has prevailed without specific arguments”.
The authors fear that reckless actions by their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disability of Anton Mamaev was fined
Mosgorsud commuted the punishment of the wheelchair invalid Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Previously, the convicted person was released from SIZO by decision of the Timiraziev Court.
At the same time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized the robbery and abduction of a motorcycle driver from a former Special Forces fighter.
Mosgorsud eased Anton Mamaev's sentence to 200,000 rbs.
“Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and therefore the person must be brought to justice” - explained “U” Press Secretary Mosgorsud Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the actual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a sentence may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Mamaev's assistant Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would justify changing the severity of the sentence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was unhappy with the decision of Mosgorsud.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal of the sentence in the Mosgorsud and Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers all the way to the European Court of Human Rights”, he said “RIA Novosti”.
Recall, 28-year-old Moscow's Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal figure in the autumn of last year.
Disability claims he bought a biker from a friend for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, motorcycle owners, including a former Special Forces fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Cerostanov, had taken possession of their property, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Military District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serostanov to three years of the colony and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment in the general regime colony (art. 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person had been placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Attorney General ' s Office for Human Rights, under President Tatyana Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timiraziev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNF will prepare an environmental report to the President
The outcome “Forum of Action” of the Pan-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, reported to the UNF "Notices" and confirmed the head of the Alexei Anisimov movement.
He said that the “frontover” forum was intended to prepare a report to the President on the problems of national ecology and to propose a strategy to address them.
The UNF interlocutors note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the News, the UNF outcome forum will take place in autumn.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been set - it is usually scheduled by the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key UNF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - Rostov Na Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buratiya Ulaan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, said the UNF interlocutor to the “Notices”.
The Co-Chair of Olga Timopheev, Head of the Committee of the State for Environment and Environment, reported that the “frontover” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Forum for Action are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we left a powerful team of experts on environmental issues, saw gaps in the legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing to the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, “frontrunners” are also reported on the work on the priority projects of the UNF, said Olga Timopheev, “Notices”.
She said that Sergey Ivanov would also be invited to the forum by a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
He had previously participated in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months from now, the Year of Ecology will be history, and most importantly, what needs to be done today is to start environmental mechanisms so that they will work for many years.
To prevent these issues from falling off the agenda, Olga Timofiev added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) andrey Koladin noted: while raising environmental concerns, UNF is operating on the presidential agenda.
Many things they have offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President, said "Investigation" by Andrey Koladin.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
Further, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to advance not only the solution to their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
Environmental activity demonstrated a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the debris dump in Balashih (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nachodka (a bill had already been drafted to ban the open transport of coal in the settlements, one of the authors of Olga Timofiev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for addressing environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the issue is further enforcement, as well as civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed, according to the Head of the Ecology for All Charity Fund, Leonid Bochin.
HR Committee member, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergey Cyplenkov, in his conversation with the “Investigations”, stressed that a responsible approach to society and business, with little legislative effort, is needed to deal successfully with environmental problems.
As soon as society and business realizes that solving environmental problems -- a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective -- the situation will change, Sergey Cyplenkov said.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that violations of environmental law were economically beneficial for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and car with his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door to his home, walk into his office, and even start a car with a simple handshake.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham had a tiny chip between his thumbs and his index finger, and now BioTek is offering this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from Royal, Winchester, to ensure that the instigation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip that feeds cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces the locks in houses and cars with a 300-pound chip for one lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which is started when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House prop cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to the records of the armed forces provided to Time magazine, the White House decision last month to send a helicopter to the South Lawn for an event devoted to American industrial production cost taxpayers a total of $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One”, when the president is on board, became the central element of the event held in the White House on 17 July that demonstrated American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and White House officials reviewed technology products from all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed near a yacht from the state of Man, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and an airlift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Aircraft (HMX-1), the Helicopter Control Unit, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or a “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to know that you are aware because this is an unusual press event,” wrote HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, the first Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, on the e-mail before the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the working hours limits.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the operation, while the unit security officers stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the recordings received by Time magazine whether the second crew was required.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the measure was contrary to that decision.
“Besides, we asked if it was a violation of the Hetch law and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to have anything to do with it,” the deputy chief replied.
The “Done in America” event was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health reform that was then in the Senate and commended the attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking them is only for the sake of photo opportunity.
Trump had already been the subject of discussions in February, when the Presidential plane had flown backwards during its first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account had been filled with complaints about the use of a presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled to see the “Made in America” display of products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington Agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy to an inch.
When Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the “Made in America” event was credited to the crew for the required training flights per month.
The unit ' s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The records of the unit indicate that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes to each side of its airport based on the flight base of the Quantico Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that rate.
“It is wrong to calculate the cost for taxpayers, based on an approximate rate of reimbursement”, says Walters.
“These indicative rates include the composition, servicing and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriation”.
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the REND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do indeed take into account the fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, spoke in defence of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show off this week the things done in America,” said Spicer.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that's worked tirelessly to create so many Americans.
It is therefore appropriate to draw this attention.”
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely in the driver’s seat in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump approached representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products of the company.
"I know Sikorsky well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Moscow to provide grants for urban hospital emergency offices
Every year, the Lifesaving Grants will be allocated to the rehabilitation and intensive treatment units of the capital clinics.
The funds will encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobianin, visited the City Clinical Hospital called Judah.
During his examination of the clinic, he provided a thank-you letter to the orthopaedist physician, Victor Prozko, under whose direction the most complex operation to rebuild the adolescent's foot was conducted.
Sergey Sobianin also reported on the decision to grant intensive urban clinics to resuscitations and intensive care units each year.
The funds will be directed towards the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named Judah is one of the largest hospitals in Moscow to date.
In recent years, new modern equipment has been introduced to the clinic, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Cologne Rural Hospital.
Currently, more than a thousand patients are being treated by the medical offices.
In addition to the resuscitation and the stationer, there are daily offices.
There are 2,800 hospital staff.
The total area covered by the clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical facility became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-stay hospitals (SCPs).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Advanced medical equipment is used during surgical interventions to significantly reduce the recovery of patients.
After surgery, they only spend a few hours at the station.
During the first half of the year, 36,000 patients were treated in a clinical hospital called Judah.
Medical staff at the clinic carried out 1,5800 operations of various degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" Sbergbank
In Nazbank Ukraine (NBU), there were no requests for purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, 4 August, with reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from a national of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, was withdrawn to agree on a brokered (through Partitebank) acquisition of 100 per cent of Sbergbank's shares.
“No documents were received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sbergbank shares in the NBA”, the communication noted.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenya withdrew the invitation to purchase the daughter structure of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was known that Nazbank Ukraine had refused to Russian businessmen Said Hutzeriev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by failing to provide the necessary documents to verify that they were in conformity with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The main shareholder of the consortium was Said Guteriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guteriev.
Sanctions against the docks of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of mother organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, according to the UN.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for the provincial council, three women are fighting for the Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overemphasized”, he said in his statement Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to provincial councils and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatiya
The continued efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatiya (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers have begun to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the Russian Federation Decision on the amendment of the Regulation on the wholesale market in electricity and power and the combined projected balance of electricity production and supply (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System for the Entities of the Russian Federation (since 17.07.2017 No. 842), has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Burma.
As a result, the cost of electricity for stormy producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have taken advantage of the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets in vain attempts to align the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkut district with a stunt of hydropower stations in Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which Buratiya is the main catchment area.
And it's only this year that progress has begun.
In March, the electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rbs/kWh to 3.93 rbs/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryatiya by decision of the Federal Government in the List of Wholesale Price Areas for which the performance of wholesale and retail markets has been established, there has been a turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkut region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff moves towards the decline for Buryatiya.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Casual Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The trade union requires assurances from the manager of the McVitie's biscuit producer in connection with his long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish GMB office reported that the company was silent about the future investment at the Tulcross site.
There are more than 500 people working at a factory producing other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that, in the event of any changes in the operation of the facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union will “know about them first”.
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish GMB requested McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
Senior Organizer Drew Daffy said: “Members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the general manager of the business and investment plan on the future of Tolcross.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; it is an essential pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the growth in subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to flourish production at McVitie's.
According to Pladis, “The manager of the Tulcro facility only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We talked to staff members about the fact that, as all companies working under the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions — and this concerns all our facilities and activities — to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tulcross facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be involved in the supply of gas to the East Petroleum Company (CNCC), but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom or Rosnefti.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sekin's request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State pointed out that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, chapter Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for WCC jeopardized the duration of the project.
Secin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Secin added.
Recall that Rosneft requested permission to use gas from the Kirin birthplace of Gazprom, located on the Sahalina shelf for the East Petroleum Company.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on the issue were ongoing and “no sharp corners were there”.
Did the FGM warn Barcelona about Naimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verretti
Parry Saint-Jerman will not stop stalking Naymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world's record-set raid three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window when League 1 was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark related to the return of Pogby to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, as PJP offers him a salary of over 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona and the rage of the proposal and how Neumar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as the source insists, close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the President of the PIC?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaze Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Khalaifi gave a strong warning to any club that would like to seduce one of the best players of the PIC.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll go against them, we’ll make suggestions to their players,” Al-Haleifi said.
“We treat all clubs with respect.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the "PJ" half-defendant Marco Verratti.
The FGM has made it clear that it will not release an Italian player on any condition, and it is now likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its proposal in the form of losing one of its most valuable players, Naymara.
