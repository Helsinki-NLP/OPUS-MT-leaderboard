The Prague Stock Exchange fell to minus by the end of the trade
After the early fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
The transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange started trading on its Monday downfall by almost six percent.
This time, it's a drop in stock on Wall Street.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Stock drop in Asia
The dramatic downturn on Tuesday experienced stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices finally erased part of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index dropped almost four percent in trade, but later some of the losses were erased and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, decreased by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Stocks at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index there, dropped by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, decides monetary policy on its own, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, the threat is that other countries will be affected.
American Stocks Blood Bath
The US House of Representatives rejected Monday's financial system support plan, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (up to CZK 12 trillion).
So the legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American stock on Monday experienced a bloodbath and the main stock indices recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent, and the decline was similar in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House had not passed, the index was in a free fall.
Congress has given in: The US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
Voting for him will be early next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters was told by the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Barney Frank.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the notification that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be "sobriety" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on what the market stabilisation package is supposed to look like," said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy off financial companies non-sale mortgage assets that withdraw financial firms to severe losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement of a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
There is still a healing plan to continue, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is because they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress decisions could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law or whether they cannot hold a last-minute session on any issue.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will see a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the aid system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, followed by another $100 billion and later by the final $350 billion.
Bush assesses progress in the negotiations
Although the President may vote in favour of this decision, the Congress may vote in favour.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the two-party effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold parachutes
Senator Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee, said that the legislators had agreed to be responsible for the money programme, to protect taxpayers from losses, to close relief, to time the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the social participants in the programme and set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems with payment.
The government should negotiate new mortgage payments that it will buy in order to reduce the monthly cost of payments to debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist Patria Finance David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"Because it is not known what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and government will split losses," said the server iHNed.cz Marek this week.
If the plan is approved now or early next week, according to Mark, it's not that important.
"It is much more important that this week the congressmen agree that this plan is supported and that it will be consecrated as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement to be approved is most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Scissors: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll discuss how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
Clearly, it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons for a person to get a separate player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the way the future owner uses and claims.
It's probably hard to get a top-notch expensive record player home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products on LP boards do not work and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you have a vinyl with an art rock, jazz or blues in your racks, you will probably dream of such a turntable at least.
The same is true with music on the road, so music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, it may be difficult to test headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, one of which is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides battery support
Some top-notch music players can do much more than just play music, but what most phones can do by chance.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, both record, he has a better, worse camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you'll also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV will take any pictures.
Universality of mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest victims of energy.
Few mobiles can play music for more than ten twelve hours, usually much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap phones, therefore, count on them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you call here and there, get another charger to work for safety - this applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worst will last for at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem is recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not each of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers will deal with the miniature memory cards used on their mobile phones without a reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except (iPod).
All you have to do is fill the machine with music from your computer via USB.
Most mobiles and players are already creating a music library by name of the interpreter, name of the album, genre or, for example, user evaluation.
Some devices display only a tree directory structure similar to Windows Explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles are more capable
When selecting a specific device, take care in particular of battery support, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, control comfort.
If your music is mainly a backdrop and if you listen to it every day just for a short time on the tram, you will need any cell phone to play MP3.
Which he can already do almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much about what music formats your cell phone or player can do.
MP3 will manage all and the complete majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most extensive instruments, and besides it, the vast majority of instruments will be able to handle music in WMA format.
Less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) occurs.
Better mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
All you need to do is visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a good argument for acquiring a music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is mostly limited to high-speed radio hits.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that it is this way of selling music (whether through GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) that will secure the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry a cell phone.
Whenever you get a taste for listening to something, you pick up a cell phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be for a lot of people.
The cheapest one is usually below three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you'll have a very decent walkman.
Most of you, however, will be limited by the absence of an exit to normal headphones.
The best and the most sophisticated phones on the technical page, even with a 3.5 mm girlfriend for ordinary headphones, cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of control with a formerly ordinary tape recorder or, perhaps, a record player is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of a accidentally turned on mobile internet and then a huge account for data transmission.
On which instrument to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy the right card, you'll fit into two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB shall be supported.
Only the most expensive ones can cope with 8 GB souvenirs.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
By capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you better reach out to specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the service is thus approaching the separate MP3 player.
In the field of Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobiles have the same user interface as self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery support (at least 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator who'd make the classics cheap.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
This was confirmed by ČTÚ, who pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in us than in the rest of the Union.
Following recent steps by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go to war.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100 percent.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often the case with the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has stated several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
I guess it's true that a classic operator with his own network doesn't seem to have too many chances anymore (otherwise, he'd probably have a hard time looking for frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a significant reduction in prices to which classical operators had to react.
However, even before Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those of us in the UK sounded.
However, it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be truly successful.
Besides, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Meanwhile, the Penta financial group, which owns U:phone in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classical operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom offers at least half the cost of SMS to its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, there can be a pretty good move and a bet on an untraceable target group.
Because this operator is specifically targeting men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that could be captured in Poland with us.
Vodafone Press Speaker Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service supply."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look too hopeful.
Rather, there will be a launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studnicková, press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
She thus directly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to do so.
Rather, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
For a long time, the GTS Novera group has not been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, so it would like to take another step to become a real competitor of the O2 Telephony in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already made progress in the negotiations," said press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Well, maybe it's coming to a better time.
It seems from unofficial information that the first virtual operator should be waiting for us by the end of the year.
For now, however, its origin is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far we have not been contacted by any subject with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň, of the O2 Telephony Press Department, said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Press spokesman T-Mobilo Martina Kemrová adds in rare line with O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
And he adds, "It's hard for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to be able to think in this short horizon."
Vodafone is more likely to be able to meet the requirements of his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial in terms of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to operators, they are able to pull a rope, they also testify to pulls around the formation of U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTÚ went to the time of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is demonstrated by publicly available information from the website of the Czech Republic.
Now, however, it is U:phone that fits as an argument why a virtual operator is not allowed.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would make high demands on him and his services in particular."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is directly striking.
It is not only the position of the Czech Republic, which, unfortunately, does not have the power to intervene in competition, unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries.
These belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry into the mobile market of a virtual operator would be possible once a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure would be concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential bidders was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," Kristian Chalupa, of the ÚOHS External Relations Department, said in an answer to our question.
I don't think he's going to be surprised by the operative representatives.
It is more than a level playing field from the Office, which is intended to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of mobile phone prices."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is clearly not in the interest of the UOHS.
In fact, shocking on the whole case is the impression of the three mobile operators, which comes from their reactions.
The question, if it really is just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
Just as the exact price of gasoline in pump stations is certainly only part of a coincidence and a hard competitive fight.
"The government has not found any signs of anti-competitive action in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore has an appropriate increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be met by the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTTO, according to which telecommunications are the only market in terms of competition.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And a mobile operator - it makes a lot of sense - to its monopoly network.
So in a certain segment, it has to be dominant.
Even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least warning to the UOHS that three mobile operators are doing the same.
However, the complaints of a number of applicants (including GTS Novera mentioned) show that very similar obstacles are encountered by all operators when dealing with them.
The weighting of the responsibilities of the CTTU is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications, which the UOHS gives away from the whole issue.
We've met him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of the CTTO to competition in telecommunications has failed, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It works when no one's looking.
In spite of this, the operation of some pseudovirtual operators, which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
They are companies issuing their own mobile phone prices, which are only part of the public.
It's usually a multi-level marketing company.
His own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
Prices of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company faces the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resales.
"If there are cases that you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would deal with and could arise in the end of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemr answered our question about this problem.
However, it is unlikely that similar activities would be carried out against responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators, however, are prevented from doing so.
Because of the activities of these companies, they have negligible profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for the UOHS is being opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes above the same procedure, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the OOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not need to be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no idea of anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When We Won't Be Most Expensive
As the text has already fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a marked drop in prices for services.
In virtually every country where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend them more or less.
Jimi's arguments used were practically identical - too small, if not too saturated market, problems with quality of services, etc.
In advanced countries, however, regulatory authorities have affected not the interests of mobile operators but their customers in these moments.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator had been created and others were wrapped up in it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case over like a hot potato.
We cannot get rid of our experience of the impression that confusion in competences is more appropriate in these cases than it is.
But let's not throw flint in the wheat.
If behind-the-season information is correct and the virtual operator really soon appears with us, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators has allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the alarm than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four implementations of a new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the state anthem where my home is.
The hymn was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bjelohlavek.
There are four versions - male or female solo singing, in congregational application and instrumental text.
Kateřina Přížínková and Adam Plachetka took the lead.
The authors of the alterations of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Belohlavek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had already said to the Czech radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who were prominent and popular to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and then with the congregation to make sure that they have a clear lecture so that the text can be understood well to judge," he said.
The Czech state anthem will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech game of Fidlovčka Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Skroupa.
She got popular, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
The first verse of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the Czech Republic.
How's the "new" anthem sound?
Prague MHD takes the chip for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the Prague Transport Company will be registered as the date on which the first passengers will enter the metro, trams and buses who will have an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, he can get about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual ticket (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have to record on their chip card in the info centres and workplaces of the Transport Company at the subway stations Museum, Mostek, Holešovice Station, Angel, Rostyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using Internet commerce can definitely forget the outlet windows at metro stations, where they have to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
The buyer will buy it online and they will record it on the Opencard card in one of the 13 offices of the City Library.
"At these places, the passenger has a barrier with a trained service, which will help interested people with internet purchases and will also record on their card a purchased coupon," said Project Speaker Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries you will be able to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are installed in several metro vests.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and passengers may already have noticed them at Rostila, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
Kupon will check the driver's location of the machine
The maintenance of machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
In suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, the main inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities travel to the capital.
"In trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, guides are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Philip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which forms the driving order of the Prague Public Transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in the cash register by the driver.
On arrival it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the register.
The driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of recorded coupons, nothing is easier than asking drivers for this information," Drápal added.
Travelers who do not drive suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon expires may go back to self-service machines where tickets are recorded.
Here, information on the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The judges wanted a referendum after the U.S.
In 1945, the judges of Germany requested the inclusion of the Forest in the United States.
It flows from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America.
Some groups of Sudanese Germans reportedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
Among other things, it comes from a letter that was kept in a private archive and is stored today in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask in a letter from the American President not to allow the return of the "forest parish" - banned by Hitler under the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation correctly and we want to be sure that American troops come to German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed by the words "People whose fate lies in the heart of the Forest," states.
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia gives supposed Sudet Germans - with knowledge of Czech national nature - the hope of only brutality, recklessness, misunderstandings, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter from the President of the United States ask that Šumavo take over the protectorate for present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and perverts minorities and nothing but contribute to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors can't sign is because they're worried about the vengefulness of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thinking of the Noise Germans, it was enough for a referendum to be held in the parish of Noise on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of postwar history, according to some monuments it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the then Sudetic Germans.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that they would move them out of the Republic, few of them had ever allowed themselves to do so.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was at war as a Buddhist German set up for the Baltic Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a captive camp in Holštynsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they could use Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, calculated that they would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive road safety events in Czech history.
It would still be possible to characterise an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rebíček's office promises to discourage the driver from acting dangerously behind the wheel.
A $150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She should discourage the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to fasten before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign says:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "you don't" is written in capital letters on the espézette.
And then in the pool of blood is the word "pay."
This should symbolize a person’s being able to pay with his own life in a moment of neglect.
The audience will be "scaring" spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents can usually be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver is subject to a system of sugar and whipping.
The sugar for them is that if they go red, for example, they save time.
The whip is a threat of penance or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce Martin Korán.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press and mostly negative ads, says psychologist.
It is already less effective that the boards alert drivers to the danger.
"If static boards are installed to warn against danger, they will likely soon merge with the surrounding area and the drivers will not give it to them," said Korán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely Prejordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Diary of Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all the (occupied) territories will have to be returned, if not all of them," Olmert said to the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an attack on two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places", which lies within the Old Town.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s departure from the Golan Heights, an insurmountable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he noted.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the (Shiatian) Hizbollah movement; they will have to give up the permanent support that Hamas terrorism (Shiatian movement) provides, Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the student agency bus near the Italian Padovy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said Minister of Transport Karel Hanselka.
The accident that killed a twenty - two - year - old steward last week was likely caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although two more seats were reserved.
However, a bus can crash, or it can slow down, even when a steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped to stand according to a technical certificate.
If the bus is not approved, the passengers must be seated.
Remote buses Student Agency do not have a place to stay; which is also confirmed by Radim Jančura's director.
"This has been dealt with by the ministry and the movement of passengers was not allowed at first.
Afterwards they called it off and we came to the point that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The Stewart Act doesn't know.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation resolves this role.
However, no legislation shall prohibit the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the driver of the vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," said less explicitly the spokesman Hanselka.
On the contrary, the head of the road traffic department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the law is treating the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus in the approval is allowed places to stand.
That's it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where the stations are and the maximum speed is limited, intercity with places to stand with higher speeds and distances without places to stand with the highest speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
The expert BESIP on the traffic safety of Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stewards on board the bus sees no major problem.
"There are many dangers in driving, and the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
It's not even sure when the turbulence comes and the plane can hit the head."
"But if the bus stops fast, of course the physical laws apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he also says, and he also thinks, in terms of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
Student Agency offers stewardship services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on arrival.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars by the director of Asia Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We have no stewardess, we have been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with some fatal injury," he said less than a year ago for Week.cz.
There's been an enormous tragedy.
A young stewardess from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died in a link connection accident in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably twisted without using the direction from the lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he interfered with the right front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These places can't be reserved for remote connections, they're blocked."
The company's gonna sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the court's Ortel, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Law enforcement?
Inadvertently
The precision of the movement of stewards on board a bus could result in an adjustment of the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works over the year.
"There was no concrete conclusion, however.
Buses don't even solve much, rather point system, maximum speed on the highway and use mobile when driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would significantly jeopardise the safety of passengers," said the spokesman Hansel, saying that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and labour security authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors do not miss the employees of the bank.
The link between the units of this düsseldorf monetary institution and the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "the central institution of the financial group of savings for the trade in capital markets," we will read in a letter that was received to the public on Monday.
WestLB shall, in accordance with the letter to this transaction, introduce a "skills set" providing long-term returns.
And it is said that such a link could be a decisive impetus to further integration in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when the board wishes to demonstrate the ability to act during a challenging period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which the savings customers know about for its investment funds, and WestLB, however, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the end of August, Chief Deka-Bank Franz Waas heard that in the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with some of the land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no point.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka-Bank, which is responsible for one half of the bank and the other of the bank, has entrusted the board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be business on the capital market or part of it.
However, the interviews have only just begun, the financiers are concerned.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3,000 employees, is not for the first time referred to in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, the merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba Bank seemed to take place.
There was nothing out of this three-party after all.
Shortly after the merger plans reached the public, the Hesen Land Government opposed the participation of Helaba.
Not even the rest of the banking houses were that connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead won Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, there have been repeated speculations about Deka-Bank's connection to Earth's banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba Bank’s Board of Directors, expressed his negative feelings about the connection of his financial home with others.
However, it appears that it is independent of this that it is necessary to bring the various public sector banking houses closer together.
Now, after the elections to the Bavarian House, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to begin drawing.
That's not very good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it is gradually losing potential partners for such connections.
In the south, it would only play second violins even though the financial crisis is still facing much better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association with WestLB was banned at the beginning of the year by the Savers and Jury Banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 80 % share in Helaba.
That would be the case with Nord LB at the most.
But the geostrategic considerations of this species are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions work together.
In June, Merl announced that the decisive question of what commercial model the future competitiveness of the Earth banks, the German Savings and Jurassic Banks should be ensured has not yet been answered.
Everything could also end with the WestLB distribution, which, of course, no one in this institution wants.
That's why the letter from the Board of Directors said that they were trying to find a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components to the Deka-Bank will show time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "the weekend with Italy"
It's for Elena for the first time, for Luca for the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena's gonna be there as his girlfriend, and I hear everything's gonna be different, she says.
Behind them, a five-litre barrel of Kaiser brand, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest prove how deep the tone can deliver his throat.
Elena Lucu slaps first and then kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the station of Puerto Nuova, they will leave this evening at 23.45 four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festival della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
The three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, with Brazilians on one bus alone.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so out loud, Marco Guarda says, it's nothing for Italy.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a leather lining and glasses with wide silver rings, belongs to the three buses.
She's been going to Octoberfest with them for five years. She's only been making three trips this year.
At night there, during the day between the beer stands, at 10:30 a.m.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome drink of Kaiser beer, cooked exactly under the Bavarian beer purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco went to the language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, after the highway towards Brennero.
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus is fast silent, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well. They'll need their strength.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where there is another bus stop on Highway 8 just before Munich and a lot of other buses with an Italian license plate.
When Marc’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7: 00 a.m., there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow hat.
On the left is a Kraut written "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marc's travel office: "conoscersviviagiando.it".
Second, "When the door opens to the beer tent, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't go forward, don't stop, not all the yellow hats on the same bench, move around the room!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tipsy ones.
"Show the security guards that we behave.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Tonight at exactly 11:30, be here again!" Understand?
And up on Wiesn, a room with beer tents.
One member of the group hangs yellow hats as signs on trees, signs and even on the election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As the "weekend with Italy" is known as the second weekend of Octoberfest.
Accurate data on the number of visitors is not available; it is said that about 50,000 people who travel through the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Order of the Munich Police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics in which Italians in front of the British (about 60 attacks) and Rakusana (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments occupy first place.
Especially popular is the Hofbräu tent in Italy.
Sleepless nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has included in its statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis development.
Because the one that happened last weekend.
With the Dax Index, a monitored financial house specialising in the financing of the property Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan from the German bank consortium of several billion to protect against turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with Monday's situation told Reuters that this loan aid will go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from a truly exhausted amount.
Money is said to come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's daughter.
According to a news report, this government financier has been extremely refinanced for long-term projects on which he has borrowed money, which is no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve collapsed by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
As compared to last year, normal income and net earnings from financial transactions decreased to zero, income from increased value of claims and from certain securities and also from the cancellation of credit trading reserves decreased by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only because of the higher revenue from the compensation for the subsequent cost of accounting for the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the interest refund under the tax system and for the brokering of trade for the companies was the 16 % reduction on the income side still moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for traders, which were then separated from the service portfolio and continued to be run by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little profit in conventional state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) projects and was internationally diversified.
From the value of his subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something down and these write-offs will have a "basic material effect" on calculating the profit and loss of the whole group, as some have been left undetermined to hear.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
For 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important funder of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Depfa.
More strongly than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it does not have any customer deposits.
After the collapse of the American investment bank, Lehman Brothers practically dried up the source of interbank loans two weeks ago because banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs the short-term refinancing funds for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros per year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for the foreseeable time and the company is protected "from the influence of international monetary markets at the moment to a significant extent of incapacitated functions".
Other sources have been told that this money ensures refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the chairman of HRE Georg Funke announced that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in due course.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervisory (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors hope.
But in view of the dynamics and incomprehensibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the credit should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Sunday afternoon, according to everything, the bank was facing insolvency, it can't, even though it's premature, calm its passions.
The share rate has fallen by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, they held fast to bond courses.
While preferential debts have virtually not moved, they lose secondary bond courses more significantly.
This applies mainly to Württemberg Hypo's former daughter's bonds and logically post-2009 bonds.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally seemed like an AIF opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood, depending on the stability of the international financial system, after a significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought them into the company by taking over Def.
As long as emission banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity.
But it can also happen that almost no one at present dares to hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming along with this partial increase, it is likely that a mere legitimate hope has now become due.
Especially long - term creditors are likely to prepare a number of awake nights when deciding whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may use the boundary line at least to create a transfer of losses from the previous accounting periods to the later years’ exchange rates for the purpose of future payment of the capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secret of a benta box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltropa's first day at a high school in Tachibana, the girls start to feel: the German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from the mang, and on her new exchange blog, she's talking about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was driven from school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes on a train to high school in Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strongly as at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine, a short session with a teacher called 'home room' begins.
But before I started teaching, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, not in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've taken on an old dress of my host mother, the blouse, the blue underpants and the black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and I tried to put it all right: 'Sionara Wo is still Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in class were squirming, giggling and waving, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangs.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly stepped into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled a lot, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when the gong came in, they literally put me to sleep.
They were talking across the board and they were giggling and asking me about the impossible and impossible -- and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all packed their benta.
My foster mom made me a lunch box, too, and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu pastry.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
These things look weird and taste pretty new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, I guess it's the salt-filled plums, no!
Bent in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made Bent, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that the boy will get to know the boy closer at the snack break.
I read about it in my mango comic books.
I wonder if I'll see it here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
After all, I've loved reading manga for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese a little once.
So it was clear to me that I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly appreciated here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify that they feel the same way when they act like us?
For several years, the "Edge" Internet magazine has published the contributions of famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it if we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to focus on another species and open up questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the outlying terrain because the hardware does not match.
When the rat is in danger, he will do the same as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, he will flee or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists consider comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective survival to animal survival.
However, this is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include a side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performing or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, between them knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that a person is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature could be the language nature of a person: because so much of his perception is related to the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if the knowledge of the tongue did not matter, it would certainly be influenced by the tongue, so that the animal consciousness, however designed, would probably differ from most of the states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to identify the appearance of consciousness in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or, because of a special hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, we are faced with major problems.
Most of my findings relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in the mind of animals regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the case of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick took, focuses more on neural colleagues of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the Nefrontal Cortex for the realisation of visualisation.
What does this result in for your feelings?
I'm producing them from the fact that an emotional system like a fear system is activated in the brain conscious of its own activities.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
From this point of view, feelings are closely related to those areas of cortex that are marked by primacy, and especially people.
In conjunction with linguistic nature, there is a slight deviation of perception, since we can distinguish and categorize states by means of words and grammar, in order to assign them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and the brain tribe devoted to physical feelings, such as Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be able to participate in feelings felt by multiple species.
I cannot, theoretically speaking, resist it, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us to be fear in rats and humans is probably the same: But how can we verify, says Pankseep, that rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
The cockroach runs away from danger - does he feel fear too?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, opposite the cockroach or the brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it to a person, how would we want to prove it to a rat?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I study emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can look forward to progress on a neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't even examine feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward than to repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platinum: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations would soon be run directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability together with Poland to organise ME," Vasjunyk said.
"But it is not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is much more to be done in both countries."
In the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are limping.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work now as quickly as possible," said the president of the Ukrainian union, Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee was called off and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Miroslav Drzewiecki.
He said there is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki, Polish press agency PAP.
"President UEFA Michel Platini has been assured by letter that the preparations for ME 2012 will not take this step."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to forced descent in the last season because of manipulation, and eventually even the beginning of the league had to be moved rapidly.
The indignant Dennis Quaid returns the blow.
She wanted to do an ad for a new movie, she talked about private matters - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex-Dennis Quaid as a pervert of marriage.
He's furious and he's giving back the blow.
The late war of roses with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: Seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having an inconvenient dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan spoke to the American magazine InStyle for the first time last week about the reasons for the failure of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't know about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
For this mental stripper, the PR was Ryan's work for her new film "The Women" - he tells the story of a depraved marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: It is "crazy," said a 40-year-old actor in the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it".
In addition, it is "politicizing" that the common 16-year-old son Jack again "publicly resembles the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since her divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
He concludes his thoughts on the move: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have an amazing family that's doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels are dropping
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights according to one current study were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have decreased again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and, following the rise in prices in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of price increases on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by an average of 6,9 % compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The cause of this trend is considered by the American Express to be a weak course of dollar, which caused the "declining taste of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices has also affected financial centres more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
In the first quarter, aviation prices also showed an increasing trend:
In order to raise kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, as many as 29.2 percent for fuel-intensive long-distance flights.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First-Class classes the changes in knowledge were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 percent increased, and 23.6 percent decreased in the second quarter.
In German national years, according to the study quoted, prices even dropped by half.
One reason for this price drop is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an Open Skies agreement that liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased competitive pressure.
The sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit airlines and also the high number of airlines that announced the competition in the first half of 2008 - it was 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to form a functioning eleven.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein - increase Unfathomable landing for representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got involved late in the game and didn't make it with a batball.
His report was accurately formulated and sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," sychael Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the chambers of the Hamburg arena.
A lot didn't happen in the catacombs, the half-time break ended, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, and he enjoys more respect than a large-scale actor.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant touched and raised his finger on the sign of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of head coach Hamburg Martin Jol.
That's probably what his order sounded like: I'm here with the other goalie!
There was no execution.
"It wasn't looking good here today," Marcel Jansen admitted later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "a more relaxed wish".
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers thanked the head of Mladen Petrić (11) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbasians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will celebrate this Monday 121 years of its existence.
So on Saturday afternoon the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lively updated table on the video wall where their team was listed as a premiere.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
He suspects that the ongoing scoreboard symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is located slowly but not yet able to shine.
"We need more emotion and more dribbling," said Jol.
After the defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the dive in the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to decline by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest score loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow got something back together.
Around 20.30, this most important world stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was with more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst part was in Dow right now American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs' shares have lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, a large investor named Warren Buffett was involved in this company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is required to obtain stock lists of financial companies which could be paid out in favour of the exchange rate, thereby reducing the burden on the State budget.
Action courses in Europe are falling steeply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US investors does not remove doubts.
The stock exchange rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downgrading and withdraws the index Dax.
America's Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank dropped the index of German shares (Dax) deep down.
Despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks of up to three quarters of its value, the government's shares of the aforementioned Munich real estate financier have lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent score of 5,839 points.
Stock markets went to their knees all over the world.
In New York City, a business day began on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors fear that an US government rescue package worth $700 billion would not have to be enough to revive the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, which is 10 809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could express itself on October 1st.
The other European stock exchanges went one way: the FTSE index in London first weakened by 3.2 percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index dropped by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61 units after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index of Sensex lost 506,43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trade ended at 12,595,75.
In MDAx, they lost after the announcement of an increase in the stock of Arcandor.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has written down 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that Thomas Cook would not sell his shares.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known how to deal with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity should not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" was flying through space.
She is now facing death in winter because of the fuel lines that are soon to freeze.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - an anomaly of gravity.
Gravitational washing is an aerial maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is surprising: Flying bodies do not behave 100 percent as a man would expect under the good old gravity law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptised by an anomaly of gravity.
Several experts fear that even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the appeal of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of gravity by means of so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is clearly a gravitational force that can be seen as having an effect on other cosmic bodies.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, meaning that it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, exactly the visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the abductions of tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister, the abductions of tourists are once again at large in Egypt.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
He said six kidnappers were killed in the pre-release shootout.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
The ransom talks are on the way.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELLT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists are said to be free of all charges on the Sahara.
They informed the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media accordingly.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24 release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We are just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and also eight Egyptian guides are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background remains unclear before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted worker said.
They said "it was just a hostage to take over," when suddenly "this surprise" came out.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked for a six-million-euro ransom for Germany; the money was to be transferred by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, with a reference to one of the German mediators, said that the release of hostages stretches because the kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
Men should be held until kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
The abuse of the father " led to suicide"
Several years of abuse by a father led a woman to kill herself, to be heard in court.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-and-a-half-year-old Michael Treese of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that Stephanie Randle's stepdaughter was tied up regularly when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote to Treris in a confession.
It was also said in court that Ms. Randle killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Treise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked at the pub.
Treise divorced his wife in the '80s and went back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was reported before the court that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust organization, was pursuing a ghost of abuse that was committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife stated in court that in 2006 Ms Randle's friends said that she was also very committed to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's believed to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, "I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said to him: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, it probably wouldn't have gotten to the court at all."
"I would particularly like to stress the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime against their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously, otherwise, she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left classified documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two classified documents on a train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the least serious offense against that law, and nothing suggests a criminal intent.
BBC Defence Writer Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was settled internally between the ministry and the government," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police Officer be charged on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Societal reserves face debt B&B
British cooperative reserves may have to settle more than £80 million after saving Bradford & Bingley.
The government provided deposit protection for 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take customer deposits, including 59 cooperatives.
The Director-General of the Association of Cooperative Reserves (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "submissive" that the reserves and their members must pay.
The 14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is in the meantime will be paid each year by all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Compensation Plan Fund for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have acted with discretion... must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the reserves should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on debt will increase to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the reserves will have to find £81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Business Association of Social Reserves, said to the BBC that he was convinced that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that acted prudently during the expansion of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from prudent."
According to the BSA, no backup has been dropped since 1945.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what possibilities there are for protecting the cooperative reserves and their members from an account that could be significant," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover seven months from the end of this September until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since the cooperative reserves are non-shared organisations, this account will ultimately be payable by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates in their accounts.
Milk is going to be fivepence per litre.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey's dairy office has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre from Monday.
This year it is the second increase in prices, after a two-pence auction in February, and comes after a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether or not they want to reflect at customer prices.
Before February's rise, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi expremier denied
The Bangladesh Court rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vadied's application for bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with charges of blackmailing a certain businessman for over fifty million dollars ($729,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption that are being brought against it.
Chalida Zijá, a longtime political rival of Shaich Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Shah Hasina is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her side, the People's League (Awami League), has asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she has been released for an honest word to take a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, under the conditions of her release, if she remains at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Shaich Hasina's application for bail by not needing bail when an examination is already being conducted abroad on an honest statement," said her attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's orders."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shich Hasin is scheduled to return home after October 17th.
She was arrested last year after an army-held interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June to be able to go abroad for a medical procedure.
Shah Hasin and Khalid Zijá both reject all charges brought against each other.
Fear of Armour Vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children did not participate in a recent flat-rate vaccination against armour due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not reach the children in the south in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesman said that despite the promises made by the Taliban, thousands of vaccine workers would not be attacked or prevented from working.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost its court dispute over the review of the Commission’s decision on competition, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB’s Court of Appeal for Competition ordered it to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share had a competitive struggle and had an disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in a trade that prevented NTL from now renamed Virgin Media, ITV buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB caused doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to initiate the investigation.
The head of the Virginia Consortium, Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportional solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation into the American attorneys' affair
The US Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the report on the affair drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to seek justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious complaint, including a potential crime, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to make witnesses testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Justice Ministry stripped nine US lawyers of their functions in December 2006.
That's when the ministry said that lawyers were released for weak performance.
Later, however, it turned out that the release of lawyers had not been assessed worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate the allegations of voter fraud brought against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and bringing lawsuits against the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Ministry, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got fired and eventually resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also resigned.
The Inspector-General's report on Gonzales' role in the affair was very critical, saying that he had "the primary responsibility" for letting him "abdicate" from his leading position and in the event "notably engaged".
Other officials, including former senior Bush advisor Carl Rove, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loafo's reign will be appreciated
The rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who comes to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize said he was "honored" with recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nomination is run by the Coldplay Group, which has come to a narrower selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single, and it peaked in its 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in a ladder for about nine years and sold worldwide by more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on by irregular heart rhythm after collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscrucial streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other terrestrial communications, some famous, others only beneficial.
But also many taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village and it leads north of First Street - without getting on Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and 40 meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic move.
There's no sign of the street names.
She's practically invisible in the normal atlas.
Yet, he has the streets of admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to newize and create a cleaner gateway to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were abbreviated by an alley simply because it was one of the last remains of the time the block was cultivated.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of Construction, which has the street in its power, has no interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the Municipal Community, representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay planned a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Susan Stetzer, District Manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers this option when the street remains in the hands of the city and asks for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The place already owns only very few land, and we would like to keep Extra Place in its possession," she said.
"Proposals could be made for repair and administration, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to relegate a small street and set up seating places, some of which would be used by a coffee shop whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy a street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to fix this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale had proposed a city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Construction Authority, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office was to develop assets rather than manage.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a shallow trail in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's big farm was divided between several of his children and no one was entitled to that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk monument that closed in 2006, led to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the best known as the background photo of the Ramones band's album "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of waste, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the processing of the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, although modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarita - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog entitled Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Rages: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the City in the Extinction Process"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the column "Let’s talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the day and bounded by cutting iron doors of warehouses and blocked windows, where the weeks of old newspapers are being chased in the strips."
Except for a few exceptions, the street looked exactly the same the other night.
The rat ran across the dead end of the street near the door, which once led to the CBGB, where today's expensive clothing store is located.
There were graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty beer bottle next to a fresh dose of discarded newspapers.
A couple of strangers said he didn't think very much of Extra Place, but he suggested he could use some kind of hiccups.
On the contrary, Fields said he thought that some people underestimated the impact of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Bilinguality Debate: Diving into English
In this edition of the section Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for Bilingual Education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker from California and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why High Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively addressing the Spanish voters is a tricky matter.
The education agenda for Barack Obama just proves it.
Obama's campaign points out that "African and Spanish students are significantly less likely to reach than white pupils," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda particularly urges, inter alia, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are learning English only.
The question for Barack Obama remains, however, whether his commitment to Bilingual Education, which stresses that languages other than English are used in class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, charter elementary school in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Spanish from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are learning English.
Even so, in the state mathematics tests in 2008, one hundred percent of fourth grade students reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety - three percent of fourth - grade students reached the highest level in state tests in English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street stresses control and exercise, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Next, and Obama should notice, according to Linda Michaels, director of Sixth Street, the educational approach of the school for those who are learning English only, is "total immersion".
Diving into English highlights the almost advantageous use of English in teaching.
Ms. Michaels, who's against Bilingual Education, said to me, "We've had a huge success with a brand-new student from Mexico -- after 12 months, you'd be in the classroom and you wouldn't know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school as a Sixth Street Prep as a model, what should other schools with large shares of Spanish and English-speaking students look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question clear, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education undermine Obama's prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized things when he declared that people should stop worrying about "English" laws.
Instead, "you should ensure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should rather think carefully about the educational patterns that work than make fun of them and trivialize them.
Oil plummets rapidly due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices dropped sharply Monday due to concerns that even the US financial market rescue plan would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of the termed oil trades decreased in the morning trade on the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 percent to 99.80 dollars per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street as well as by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, and again they jumped into a wave of huge uncertainties in the financial markets.
Anxiety was reiterated by investors on Monday, even after the congressional presidency announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history on the weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by the fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive decomposition, the government announced that the Citigroup Group would purchase the Banking Section of Wachvia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially increased the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital's analysts said that the frenzyd weekend talks that led to the economic rescue plan "are proving unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation worsens, commodity demand, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlooks for markets in global shares, interest rates and exchange rates have become very uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is to what extent the American virus will spread to the whole world and especially to China."
The Bank's analysts reduced their expectations for next year, as oil consumption declined due to a slow growth in the economy and reduced their 2009 gas price forecasts by about 20%.
A wild ride in the second quarter beat the team record
After spending the last eight seasons in the Jets jersey more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned the pointless game into a great ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled their tormented game with cloud clouds over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which marked a perfect afternoon in which their progressive cooperation moved miles ahead.
Favre sent Cole in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one where he fell in the cornerback, and another 10 seconds before half the game.
"It was nothing special," Favre said about all his stakes to Cole.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've had excellent communication, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were throwing, the defense was attacking the Quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis picked up a stray pitch and brought him back 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typed another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked the 20-yard goal out of the field, thus winning the lead 34-0.
That's the most Jets ever won in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe this madness, said, "Second quarter, or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
He dropped many points in the short time section."
Restful Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best distance runner at all, when on Sunday in Berlin’s marathon he overcame his own world record and became the first person to run 26,2 miles long under two hours and four minutes.
Winning on a pleasant flat track in the time 2:03:59 rolled 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he surpassed the world record or at least master of the world at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was afraid - perhaps too scared from a backward perspective - that polluted air irritated his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on start, 55 degrees on target - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a brilliant average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds on the mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have focused on the longer track, the marathon record in the past decade has declined more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a spasm in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously woke him up before it delayed him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - for over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon peaks, relying on guides as if it were a race on the track, and building world records over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half in time 1:02:04.
After the guides left, two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi chased Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles ahead of the goal of Gebreselassie took the last time and fled to Kwambai, who then reached second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended up third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race ended the excellent year in the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 is holding Paul Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Sixty-year-old Mikitenko won surprisingly last spring in the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed Beijing games because of something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that she had ever run, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run to the big head and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31 and Helena Kiprop from Kenya ended third in time 2:25:01.
Pride and Obstacles to the Life of Blacks in a Separate City
Hidden among the vast amusement parks of the larger Orlando, several miles from everything shiny, noisy and brown, lies a quiet city in which the pride and intensity of African American life live.
Eatonville, the first fully black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet playgrounds, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough quayawa, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival of Zora! to present a gift to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she made it a tourist stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project during the economic crisis.
It's still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's losing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on race, many locals remain wary of foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It's got to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the Black Rise and a community of almost 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double compared to the national average.
It is the centre of literature, but also oak-shadowed example of the rural rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And concerns about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She presented her hometown to the world through the heartful books of the Rivers as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city to road No. 17, which leads through the often missed centre of Florida, into the stage of black history and human drama.
With the destruction of the big drum in life and in literature, Hurston's readers were brought to the store by First Eatonville Mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new widow Dash's husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and anything that fits the clock hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville linked to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This clearly wasn't the typical Fodor's publishing company.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper exterminator who often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived without an announcement in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of decent clothes today.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but a lot of them were squirming.
"People always liked to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on the chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut off from the press.
She seemed to be forgotten by Eatonville and the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings.
"I don't think they understood her meaning for the world or her reference at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the '80s of the 20th century.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city along a five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
The break-up of Orlando has already pushed interstate highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, he brought the struggle to stir hate races to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady here who killed her.
They threw a melon out of the car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's requirement of forced integration and his decision in the Brown versus the Chamber of Education case stated that "it is more offensive to my race than to celebrate."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took a while for teachers and pupils to come from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier there," said Miss Nathir.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neal Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless confidence and feelings such as "How can someone deny the delight of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the revival of her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the bookshelves in the bookshelves of the famous Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway, who reintroduced it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the lights of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to his highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and each January many return to the celebration.
After a few years, he resigned from the highway project.
"The five power lines of the highway have risen, you would say it has set off a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Extracurriculars like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church here in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course), was opened in 2006 at the newly embellished and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a dead end in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it's 90 percent black.)
Strange people who come to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville are often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is necessary to have in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church, painted by whites and displayed by blacks in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, self - confident teacher who likes to eat red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
Even so, as the Hurston Festival increased, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston has seen her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds like genuine love for the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police, who he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as 11 - year - old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Cannon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just drive by, think, 'Hmm, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look into history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently financial
Nothing's changed at first sight.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stations and round TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize that they're standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in a glass bee hive the offices over their heads have daily bankers and investment fund managers who monopolise New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Messengers are still running metal carts on the sidewalks and transferring muffin ovens to breakfast meetings.
The Spaniards keep moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, 50 ironed shirts hanging from the scales on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in the front for their morning bagel at the street dining stations, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab between the fourth and seventh afternoons on a daily day.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was on time for this assignment to hide with the late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting on the front line.
Not in front of cashier's windows to pick up or save cash, but in front of a barrier where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to the Macy's mixed goods trade and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
However, against me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called trifts (a little bit like construction savings), money associations and from those types of savings companies whose branches operate only in one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been silently bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went to audition, and when the New Yorkers came home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a bailout.
The employees of the offices and shops, who stood before me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that was perceived as a safe port, making most of the rescues on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluently in the last week.
Some woman at my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and to her skinny top executive, Dick Fuld, with such a familiarity, as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old housewife of my tenant, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food supply.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I moved it, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves defiled after Austrian right-wing fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right hand side of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-hand side of Vlaams Belang, participates in the event presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "Towns against Islamisation".
They bear signs similar to the traffic stamps that show the mosques crossed by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of depriving the Muslim cemetery in Austria of the same weekend in which the extreme right-wing parties achieved huge gains in the general elections.
Over 90 graves on a cemetery in Traun, near Linz, were once between Friday night and this morning badly destroyed and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits have poured on some graves Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that this could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was connected to the elections in any way.
The speaker of the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" with reports of annihilation, which comes at a time when the Muslim post month of Ramadan is nearing its end.
In the meantime, Austria enters the circle of soul searching after the traffic in yesterday's parliamentary elections has deteriorated.
Both far-right parties, which won more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, waged a hugely anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Free Party, who won over 18% of the votes, protested against scarves and burqa in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the food in which the relation to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't go on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials placed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police approved this travel ban last Thursday after giving officials evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, owned by Paul Gadd, did not attend a hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
He said: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kent police asked Ashford's lowest criminal court for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally take part."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as recorded in the sex offender's register.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to give the planned date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he had failed to inform the authorities, he could have been sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible routes after the district.
Kent police spoke: "The Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain, because we have large-scale systems that control potential danger more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is the highest priority for the Kentucky police, and we are working hard to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers so that we can reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls between the ages of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him pass passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22nd, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in western London and at the same time he successfully requested an order from Scotland Yard to register himself as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I am photographing the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, which are detached from the focus on interpretation, will I achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
The second one is human.
Inseparable, if we miss privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see the confidential gesture, the depth of the summer caught sight or the passionate gestures of hands that are carefree because they are not going to get on the stage.
German Günther Bauer swaps in "Flamenco-people" theatre performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less famous face of masters.
To this end, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place under the program Months of Flamenca (Mes de la Photographia Flamenca), "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
These people painted "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and totally capture viewers.
It is not necessary to take pictures on stage to capture the personalities of these artists.
He's wearing his personality and personality inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas" Bauer began a long trip in 1997 to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the selection of cameras and materials, resemble classical photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the picture and lends him the present spirit, which is an idea that Bauer himself reflects and flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not stop surprising and evolving."
What knocks the audience apart is not the act of dancing, singing or playing itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant work presented during these days at the El Fotomat Gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists creates famous characters of flamenco, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebriano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon await a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
Vasen for portraits led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to know them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think there's a portrait of the most difficult genre in the photograph.
A person encounters or encounters people, personalities he never knows or only gives him a few minutes to photograph.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the El Fotomat Gallery on 20th Street, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "tribulation"
It takes place in an environment that he does not yet know and tells of events for strangers, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for 20 years and traveled to Amazonia.
The eternal favorite of Nobel Prizes for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival that the project that currently employs it is "tourage", and that "everything testifies to the fact that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe that I will do it once," he concluded his paper at the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in four days.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutant friend" - filled the theatre Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Felix Romeo, who mentioned him, he had before him a dedicated audience, an hour of time running like water - a Peruvian with an amazing accuracy and a notable dose of humor, remembering how from his original "incredible adventure" from "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and "the power to live more than I've lived" he gave birth to a literary mission; how he whispered "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined", carefully scraping the text, correcting and rewriting; or how his writings influenced Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembrance images" are the cornerstone of his stories.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere fun, a fleeting experience" - he stressed Vargas Llossa with the fact that according to him "acts on people" and "forces them to try to get out of line", and urged the writer to "not subject to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their mission.
Climatelogy loses the ceremony in Pozoblanc - no spears
The performance with the spears, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanec, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the effectants was confirmed that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
That is why the company, along with Fermín Bohorquez, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions have narrowed it down for a long time, two out of three celebrations have not been realized.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the second planned bullfights.
During them the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena on Castilblance.
But this was only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and rewarded for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance was carried out on his shoulder.
On the same day in the afternoon Alejandro Talavante changed two blows by kicking his greetings and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than Toretorian art.
Even worse was El juli, who walked through the bull arena of Los llanos unscathed.
In the second round, he has received strong criticism from most of the audience without a single breath.
They took control of Alav in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza Road Control in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop two people driving in a van and they drive them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Bureau of the Basque Government, they were persecuted and detained by members of one of the people driving in the van, a 38 - year - old man identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsification of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places where they crossed the border of the city district of Armignon.
They were going to stop the van for control, but the driver didn't follow the instructions, so he speeded up and left.
The officers of the car immediately began to chase when the vehicle stopped at the border a few miles away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled to the forest.
The Ertzaintzy officers finally caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, who the suspects were transporting, as it appeared during the search of Iveco Daily's van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish which were subsequently transferred to the other police departments for detailed expertise and weighting of drugs.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "moved" and disagreed with the particulars contained in the documents of the van, so the detainee was also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzainza continues to search for another suspect, who, as mentioned above, managed to escape so that the origin of the seized drug can finally be determined.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was transferred to the police department to resolve the necessary formalities before he later embarked on further investigation.
Heather Locklear's actress was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, reported the magazine People Speaker of California Road Patrol.
The Witness stated that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "swiftly trampled on the gas, driving in front and out the back and trying to get out of the parking lot - several times when she was leaning over the sunglasses".
A Witness who apparently did not know the actress first saw Locklear for a moment after stopping at a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was worried about the life of Locklear".
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the car.
"She seemed disoriented," and that's why the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit to the test.
According to the police speaker, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was eliminated, although "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was visible to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained for suspicion of driving under the influence of a more unspecified substance, and around 19:00 she was taken into custody even though she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The Head-General of the IU and the Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, announced today that the final decision in the case of the former Council of Youth and Sports Council in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of working for the benefit of his family, would depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am an overly federalist, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out the negotiations that the party will have to take in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the Head of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct that Silva had committed, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought for similar matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has "a strict ethical code for all public functions".
"May blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garcia in the film "Sangre de Mayo", inspired by the episodes of the national past by Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, he wanted the film maker to "paint the expression of the characters and the analysis of society" which he always admired in the work of the famous novelography, explained today with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarria during the presentation of the film before a large team of interpreters.
May blood with a metre of over two and a half hours will be shown in the movies this Friday and in the future more than four hours of TV TV TV TV Telemadrid is going to be ready.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garcia, he claimed that he had fulfilled the "childish dream" that Esperanza Aguirre owed to him three years ago in the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming the image for the 200th anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer with the fact that the story would come from the Episodes of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means for Garcia "a unique opportunity" to create an environment with the scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "the cracking Spain, which was wrong in the leader for whom it was fought - the struggle for independence led under the governments of Ferdinand VII to the fall and backlog of the country," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that came to the films of the Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's ghosts - almost twice the May Blood - so he could not film some scenes from the script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as usual - on the scene with actors he usually tries with before shooting and does not choose casting because it feels "demeanor" to him and also believes that "participation of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas and thus find out what is going on in the craftsmanship he deals with".
Many actors chosen for May blood appear before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia with four nominations for Oscar, one of whom received one, is of the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, does not represent a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "it will only appear".
There's no appreciation for this movie, Garcia.
"At first, you think you're working for what's going to happen, but then you realize you're only working for profit, so you'll have to make another extra movie," Garcia explains with more than 30 years of directing career.
Isabel Bayon is reviving the spiritual link of the Sevilla Dancer Tortola Valencia
Seville's flamenca dancer gives up holding another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from Father Catalance (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Mother Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved to London with their family.
She danced modern dance and focused on Oriental dance.
She's been through a life of passion, a pioneer of female emancipation like Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the removal of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepo Gamboa and she proposed this character to me -- it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not talking about telling her life, we're talking about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the beats of flamenco.
That's how the butterfly dance evocated my guajira or the snake dance.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic was also appropriate," she says.
The performance is based on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Guide, who will sing in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La Puerto abierta), and with the teacher of dance Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her former apprentice.
"Matilde represents the elders of Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour for me."
The show also includes music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Pac Arriagy, singing by Miguel Ortega, El Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pajara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of actor Juanfria Juárez, "who is the eternal guide of this kind of artist who are prima donnas with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played for her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she was usually in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who at some point have a huge influence, but no one knows her today and even less appreciates her creation," Bayon says.
The show starts today at 8:30 p.m. in the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Journal of the Newly Married" closes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Newly Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), on the spot where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalucan Government to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Anniversary of Their Death.
The Zenobia and Juan Ramona Trials are about to end with the new edition of this work, the international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun Ray", which was opened in May of this year, and after a tour of various Andalusian provinces, it should be moved to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalus government also ordered eight hundred copies of "The Newly Married Diary" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Perez-Encis to continue to spread the knowledge of the personality and work of one of the world's most sacred Andalus poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No evil intent" and under the heavy knowledge that Newman has left, reveals his unsatisfying vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Even so, he was a boy to all.
"Sometimes what a person feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid he'd be funny or exaggerated.
The father of the film and the country died in a particularly dark time of terror and financial markets, at a time when American confidence is at the bottom, when they desperately seek reasons for pride.
When time is harsh and people without virtue and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter in both lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has worked hard to rid itself of a suicidal diet culture.
The stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man had died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar's director, Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without a stake in his career.
A bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has been calling himself Newman's greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put us all in a pretty high spot," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman today - based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, people like that are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He got divorced once, and since then he's been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who's been faithful, although he's certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger if I had a filet at home?" he used to joke.
May he be accompanied in heaven by pride in the fact that there is a judgment on earth between his daughters and admirers - it is not too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he has embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrificing philanthropist."
Imperfect Olympic Madrid races
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed year 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I ask you, are we ready?
If we're going to ride the race last night, I say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my court he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that if it came to an evaluation and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense starts by picking up a race number that needs to be picked up early.
I don't think that's wrong, but when a person goes there, give him everything (including the chip that's supposed to prevent the overload of the track).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after standing up the right front) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (second nonsense because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy just a little T-shirt because it's less stuff and it's cheaper?
Well, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front lasted over 15 minutes, the backpack had to be delivered there.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something that is not understandable.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put our backpacks down yet, and when it did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait extended for 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general awakening and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have an infection tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not show the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me, which I suppose didn't tell me the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of that.
So I guess we're just gonna have to make ourselves a dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a reception (virtual)
At a conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system on the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic activities such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company’s entire area) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room who are -- even remember what they are wearing -- and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
They can also sort the present by conversational groups.
On the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that he is not part of the group that talks to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going after anyone, and she's telling her she's going to be giving it to her in a minute.
It's all without a blue death screen.
That's amazing.
But of course that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers only had the necessary, without the burden of commercial waste, they'd be five times more efficient -- man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when we consider that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system slowly loses meaning and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer is turned on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around the windows.
What is the use of half the applications that accompany the system?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and I have a little example here.
I took this photo in a restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, she showed an independent study that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new Windows Mobile 7 version was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count until 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computerized.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabulux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on Azur's coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the lights in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in "The Godfather" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to start counting his life roles, we can dive down to the image of a typical muscle with a pointed mustache that lifts the chinks in the cat show.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton man's underwear, attached and without sleeves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabulux Marcel of Brussels excels above all others.
First of all, for his neckless name - even though the people call him 'Marcel' - which is related to sports, because, as the legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, singer lover Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost notable) Belgian flag, which models of the most embalming calves have as detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not specializing only in tank tops.
He also manufactures college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, Navy T-shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Designed pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Though it's too bad they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
The enormous image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, a small figure, is a woman full of life.
Their new fashions are now taking the Cruz sisters very seriously.
For Monica, that means a lot more than just some pretty, famous girls borrowing their name.
In Paris, the promotion event that Mango organized in its new home took place, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion prices that this Spanish company is sponsoring.
She's warm and shy, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came here to introduce a new collection that we proposed for Mango this autumn-winter season, and I also participated in the launch of the second year of "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Opera to honor Valentina.
So it was a challenging but exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango, which you've been working for for for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we drew a lot of incentives from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and layer their clothes, I do so very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked my clothes for a while, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, wake up in my aunt's closets, and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch my dress.
You know, we dancers rely on how we're designed to feel good when we're in our class and when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you'll really get into character.
So everything is connected, of course, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You're 30 recently, have you had a crisis?
No, no, no.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, 30's amusing me.
I find that a woman is ready, has experience, and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks for it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will make my child feel happy and raise him with great love.
As for the movie, there are now several premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to it when they come to the movies.
I come from a theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now, and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La ultimima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
On purpose, how will you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at Naomi Campbell's playhouse, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm gonna go up to the pier like a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes that we have presented - I have also selected two models from our collection for Mango - was irritated and the profit was handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and I, since I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to play for charity, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of the women of the Third World, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers caught repeatedly with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting a car intoxicating or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was already known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the High Representative of the State, which states that it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the drivers behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take the driving retraining course.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Cars (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of road users accused more than once of driving drunk again in this condition will sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded above the permitted concentration of alcohol.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that in the case of vehicles equipped with this equipment, the infringements decreased by 65 % during the first year following the introduction.
In Spain it is calculated that it could save 115 lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: that such behaviour should be dealt with before it commits a criminal offence.
And in order to assist in its implementation, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial cars and public service vehicles have already been installed.
Tomorrow the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peepoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as was the case with the program, a plane of Spanish air force arrived at the Presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico D.F., where the prince and princess from Asturia arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays had to close their eyes so that a follow-up couple could be seen from the plane.
Under the stairs was the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, on the street, I asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, well, that's great, it won't get to the airport at that time to recruit people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to fire an honorable salva.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue colors and a princess, very indistinguishably dressed and with pink hair, he does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. a storm is threatening.
Before they go to the O.R., they smile at the photographers and pose to them.
At the hotel door, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, there is a Mexican television reporter waiting for them.
Best subsidized fashion price
There's probably no place in the world more suitable to announce a fashion price than Paris, and there's probably no better designer and no bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by an amount of EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandra Beansoli, winner of the first year, examined her proposals at Manga's exhibition at the Paris Haussmann No. 54 and almost cried with affection.
Of course, it is the second largest business in Europe and it has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many of the events, along with the desire to thank the designers Valentin for taking the presidency of the jury, have resulted in a proud dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango’s solemnly decorated chair looked even more amazing next to the most famous Chagall works.
Nati, who, with a heartbroken grief over her brother's recent death, showed no sign of anything, put on the clothes of this brand and the jewels of ELAH, which were covered in breath, and hung in her son Luis - almost two-meter elegan - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner to honor him.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, welcomed himself, and as a true gentleman, he stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, for they both offered them to the two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - pants and shirts and at dinner changed into long black sexy dresses, touched the night walk around the Opera with Goya Toledo, showed us the ballroom exams, and, remembering other times, caught one of the poles and suggested "grand plié".
Inés Sastre showed us pictures of her son on her cell phone before leaving.
The next morning we could love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own sheets and towels and asked that no scent be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - counter-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about a chaotic and crazed everyday life.
And not to be too little, they're all summed up in one book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm bell rings every morning at seven o'clock as punishment, but even worse, it is to imagine itself swallowed up in a hasty rhythm that brings present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods of coping with daily exhaustion nor with problems of drifting away from the world of work.
No, it's not a bigger number and it's nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott collected all the "me" options, adjusted according to the taste and timing of each individual, from outside the Yogi position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book.
The anti-tress book is called "1001 mode of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone considers that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, this opinion is rejected by the "guidebook".
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% of natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If there is no adrenaline in your veins that restores balance in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off, and concentrate on reading.
Speaking from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may frighten you, but it's really meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somniocvie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you has been told that he spoke from sleep at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (for example, once a life in high fever), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child remembers nothing.
There's not just one reason why she'd be here.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nightmares, or sleepwalking, but it may not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fever, stress, or anxiety.
In any case, it is a small study phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, speak individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where a child manifests great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult an expert to see if he has a problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it joins another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. when associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by remembering a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the kid too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for peaceful games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or TV shows.
In very nervous children and those who are given a job to relax, it is possible to use relaxing techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
It'll give the baby a quieter sleep.
When suspicion appears, try to remain calm.
Remember that she is harmless to the child and that the next day she will not remember anything.
Useful Tips
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you're going to interrupt his sleep.
Even when he's talking, he's sleeping, and then he's resting.
Remember that if you feel that you are very worried several times, it would be appropriate to ask for advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he sleeps, he's not conscious that he can organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks, and why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
It's not funny.
That's what's causing so much anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeurn... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long, thin period.
Without a particularly big game, the yellow-necked created more chances and managed to transform one of them into a winner.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this confrontation, in which the attackers had difficulty pushing themselves.
After the first attempt of Captain Kauffmann's guests, who shot from a distance only by a hair missed the link, began to have the Illhaeurn slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne with air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to annoy Dannemaria's defense.
On the contrary, the opponent built a defensive wave in the middle of the field and left only Agile Riahi at the top of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, thanks first to the two chances of Dannemaria with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeustern, which Marais took care of, well placed to process the ball reflected after the previous Diebold test (53').
But Golman Illhaesserna did not enjoy it for a long time, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to his dressing room and leave his teammates in awe.
But Dannemaria could not profit from this, and the eleven from Illhaeusnern, who had just retreated a little to "enhance" the defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the last seconds of the match, when the ball after a great confusion flew very close to the log.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he leaves for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip across Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who severely violated the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports Monday morning, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinac in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The last appointed promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and they hope "to come with concrete proposals".
The Presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysian Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in order to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure conditions for the employment and payment of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with inflexibility.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation of the "eyes" (operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of congestion.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
There was a filter dam on Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when, right before dawn, the fuel stores of the ports in Brest and Lorient were burning tires and pallets while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the coast of the Atlantic and the Channel of La Manche, like the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 ships blocked the operation of merchant ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croissico in the area of Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the blockade of the important refinery Total in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until they decide to act, eventually, for a central meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide how to proceed on the way forward and its participation in the preparatory meetings at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the Heads of the State Fisheries Union, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not drop out of anything" and "they won't make it to Paris", said Lillian Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Fishermen from the profession who do not pay the oil tax currently pay about 50 cents per litre, however, believe that the ship's yield threshold is achieved only if the oil is below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes also bowed to the legend of the film and to the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies this year on the delivery of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that hangs over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, retains its supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 equipment delivered, confirmed by President Fredrik Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially with a range of aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has added 41 instruments to Chinese clients within eight years.
According to AIG, 15 % of its assets are being transferred
The insurer of the American International Group, whom the US monetary authorities received over water, is considering that he would have paid more than 15% of his assets in order to pay back the $85 billion he was paid in advance, writes a Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, states the journal, which quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday evening to investigate any action.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory declaration from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp. aviation leasing branch, its 59% participation in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, is supplied by FT.
No final decision on these actions has yet been taken, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly receive cash in order to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the risk that the US authorities will confiscate 80 % of its capital, thereby reducing it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
The biggest downturn in its history (of 684,81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the 11 September terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technological component lost, according to the definitive data after the closing of trade, 199,61 points and settled at 1,983,73 and the extended index Standard & Poor's 500 fell by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Done since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally failed after an unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that would allow a little stability to be found again in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 refused to provide Secretary of State Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Nearly two of the three republicans rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal from the sent market, which sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," says Lindsey Piezza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and voiced fears that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is indeed doomed to extinction (...), the relay will be immediately handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank, p.m.) and to other central banks to fuel the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piezza noted that in the United States "every new day brings down a financial institution".
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the Bank's Banking Authority Wachovia's rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not "only facing the US crisis but with the global crisis", the analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen.
The profit from the voucher for 10 years decreased to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday evening, the yield for 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, the second debate followed, with the task of finding out who from John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The campaign of Republicans and Democrats was not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duel, which was followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in research.
Gallup's institution, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes that the Democratic is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters who are currently concerned, Obama is the winner of 39 % of those questioned, while, according to the CBS survey, 25 % award the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership Thursday through the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," warned Bill Clinton about the weekend.
Seventy-seven McCain has consistently raised his irrefutable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the " naivety" of his rival in the issues that formed the core of the first conflict.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." there's been repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an aggressive spirit, the Republican TV spots have been broadcast since yesterday.
On the contrary, Obama stressed that he represented the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama did," he replied on the weekend of the democratic spot, which tells the republican that it does not take sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the "current American".
"During the 90-minute debate John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday that 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina election meeting were in a heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words like "middle class" or "working class." The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the brink of disaster.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
The Democratic Representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic transparency" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For democratic candidates, the current disaster is "the final verdict of the eight-year-old bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator reiterated that, despite unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans and also noted that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions relating to the $700 billion bailout plan (470 billion euros), which the Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
"Have you noticed that there have been any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital to refuse the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the election rooms at the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demis".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the polls: "What would it be like if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
It does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed to be pure.
According to the opposition, it wasn't like that.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandr Milinkieevich, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leading figure of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who is counting the votes, and we have the executive power.
If any opposition Members enter parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space in television, meetings in the regions and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we are not reformed, we are threatened to become a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the elections, should not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What do you, have noticed that there have been elections?" asked socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There was no foot in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, the ones who are most compliant with the regime."
The night's silence was re-inhabited by the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood That Is Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased, as Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained confidence in the public, who, after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was seriously shaken.
As is generally known, the state reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated during the 1980s by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and a wave of public opposition, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994 chaired by Judge Horace Krever to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to recommend that such a disaster should no longer be repeated.
While Judge Krever gave up his report, some provinces put forward a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québek, Géline's committee played this role.
Following Gélineau and Krevere's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was supposed to run Québec, and the Canadian blood company to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec began his activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was crippling.
Through systematic efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the next few years, we have regained confidence in the public," he says, and proudly adds that almost 94% of the Québek population trusted Héma-Quebek at the beginning of 2008.
Dr. Decary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"We have witnessed in Europe many human cases of mad cow disease, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease," says a woman who has been leading society since its inception in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread with blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Krevere and Gélineau, according to which, when we do not know it and when it is at stake to spread a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, we need to take exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we therefore refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode has shown us that following the precautionary principle made sense."
In 1999, there was a much more accurate technique on the market to detect HIV virus: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the donor blood to detect the presence of the virus itself, not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used previously were based.
NAT tests have reduced the deafness that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our blood technicians may be exposed to the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing and without knowing.
This improvement has significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
At the risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood, one of the 12 million people today is exposed.
"In other words, it means that before anyone gets HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I think we can get or prescribe the blood transfusions needed to heal today in complete calm," says Héma-Quebek, chief of management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of fertilising element might appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by insect sting.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," Dr. Decary continues, stressing that in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Quebec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"Needs are growing because the population is getting old.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has implications for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of the Québecs allowed to donate."
Any healthy person aged at least 18 years, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can only donate blood once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not on average accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where the mud winters are situated, they are excluded for one year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, donor network members need to be complemented in proportion to how they grow old and are no longer able to donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so untangled today that we will only find an hour so we can donate blood," Francine Decary will.
With the annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, flows with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the contribution of our thousands of blood samples from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that we will take over a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplants," Dr. Decary explains, who describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Quebec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive programme to all hospitals in Québec.
Football - Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal round of the first USL division during the second and decisive quarterfinals match, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sonders from Seattle.
The magazine Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After the double-sided goalless first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino reported the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan in favor of Sonders.
Let's remind ourselves that on Friday during the first of the two quarterfinals, the Impact suffered in the Starfire Complex in Tukville in the suburbs of Seattle defeat 2:1.
The impact will die in the semifinal with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota Thunder compensated in the home game deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semifinal round with the total number of goals 5:4.
The impact should collide with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
Canadien's first attack troika is ready to begin the season.
A unit composed of Alexa Kovaleva, Tomáš Plekance and Andrej Kosticina last night at Centre Bell encouraged an attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate attacks.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the collision, scored the goal, Plekanec gathered two assistants and Kovalev collected one match in this fourth three-colored three-colored six-game game.
Kovalev ensured victory by giving the only goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
"I need another game to make me feel good."
"In the first third he tried to handle it too much," noted Guy Carboneau.
"I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice round of applause."
Charest bets on the north.
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Québek, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplementary elections.
"To remove the borders of our last great northern border" is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually binding way at the conclusion of the Québek Liberal Party meeting in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were screened behind his back in a picture mill.
On the three curved canvas ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Extensive means, like in the electoral period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out early elections in the autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy program.
The "North Plan" is the fourth dimension of the "vision", which the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the vision of the "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently mentioned in his statements, he has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North is a "noble with enormous potential", but he did not state the time frame, the level of investment, or the clear priority in future projects.
Above all, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further divorced: in particular, water plants, forests, especially mine sectors, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest's census, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice as big as France is with us", "is in Québek.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he's calling for a national founder's myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, raised the prime minister: gold hunt in Abibi, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he was theatrically silent to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Québek's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Québec has always demanded, was specified by the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one borderline that has long been non-conventional, and if there is a suitable opportunity, I will take this position again in the name of the government," he suggested.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North," he said when he spoke of the North-West transition, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Québec government would be very careful about them and that the project would be useful to them, especially young ones.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about 30 communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelettier and in which Julie Boulett (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be set out".
The development of the North should follow the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamlessly following the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the still shaken themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail raising the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois headquarters into the Adjelard-Godbut dam.
"From Godbot, which founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, which carried out the Free Revolution and the Nationalization of Water Electricity, until after Bourass, which created James Bay, our side was able to create a future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he referred to another authority, this time conservative, and the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I say this only between us, but I plan to be in it," he confided in his member base, which caused considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of calling for elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him to do so.
However, he stressed that his program was loaded, especially with the Federal Council mission in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend event provided the head of liberals with a platform for some nationalistic resolutions, in particular certain "incentives to change the constitution", which went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal side of Québek) specifically requires recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Québec to appoint a part of the Canadian Broadcasting and Broadcasting Board members who would have veto power in the event of decisions taken in Québek.
On the part of the opposition, the Plan of the North was accepted skeptically in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chief Pauline Marois again pulled out the Northern Québek Development Policy launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came into power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck with her, "we would be here today", Marois noted by her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is coming back from the holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored country
It was Vic Toews, an exminister of "justice" (the irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour, who represented Canada as a "hamble".
Thus, to mistreat a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration, this tells a great deal about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us that, as the only one of all the participating Western countries, has not returned to the country of its nationals imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time when the acts that were being committed to him were to take place.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets it rot under the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and especially the Association of Canadian Lawyers, defend Omar Khadra's repatriation so that he can await a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before the torture: little does it matter to her that this young man is later psychologically destroyed, and this no doubt persisted after so many years of suffering.
We don't realize it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so fond of and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morals: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him according to the wishes of the head of the minority government so far (how it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the side that declares virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has renounced the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame is, Mr. Toews, in this surrender, not elsewhere.
Views - Barrick Gold's Orwell discourse
In a September 17th edition, Le Devoire published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched the prosecution of three authors and a poor little publisher for insult to honor in order to create a "transparency public debate" and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honour, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver is completely past that crucial resolution.
Or is it for Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public debate, to bring down anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever happens, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend an honorable sum to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight against an army of lawyers supported by almost empty pockets of mining company.
The tactics of these unequal fights are often the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will stifle the mouth of the opposite party and, in addition, kill anyone who dares to commit the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, she had a public view of the whole thing.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold is active, there is a debate in Canada under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, not in earring wounds.
Mine companies were therefore not enough to open their books, their documentation and to have a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver can explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time disdain the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world only refers to fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it is a very narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, even the Nazis have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public, which supports authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining companies.
The public is prepared to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not within what many see as a prosecution, in which the defendant is to be stifled (in the context of his prosecution of the "public debate", Barick, by the way, has just made an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they are to stop using this term...).
In addition to Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of research and the search for truth, which are essential to every democratic society.
It generally denies the right to quote reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations that form the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not liked by the wealthy companies of this world without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been created by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada.
He has the right to an answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to have a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as it is for a public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures that would limit such an unjustified prosecution.
Operation to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Bush's administration and representatives of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, eventually reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to curb the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of public money saved, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized for non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi House and a representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good report yesterday, minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"It was all done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis that is just taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption of the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, the negotiations have run on maximum rotations out of fear of the effect of further failure at the disposal of investors.
A certain time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed themselves rather for the agreement, but did not mention expressing their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed a new agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at enabling the owners of the maintenance of their residence, and measures on the wages of the Heads of State of Work saved by companies.
"If we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station whether he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, replied, "I would love to see the details, but I hope so."
"The harsh features that I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to spend and that will enable us to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy off the money of taxpayers a questionable claim and the risk and non-sale assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis triggered by the collapse of the bubble in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of the risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and emerged in the freeze of cash and into the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft of the agreement last week is borne in mind by the Republican Members.
Since the Democrats have agreed that for some "toxic" assets companies with difficulties the government will only guarantee, but will not buy them, there is a belief that the in-out situation is being set on fire.
In an effort to bring the conflicting views closer in Congress, a measure was added to the effect that the government would be able to introduce new charges that would help it to recover its contribution if the programme would require it to recover losses over a period of five years.
The new plan will be based on a contribution of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for Washington's help, he'll get the stakes in the rescue companies that will pay him dividends if he wins and he can resell them when it's over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the confiscation of loans related to the plan, as well as to lay down limits for the assessment and compensation of employees affected by the company.
The planners would like to submit the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the effort that has been made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, both in the Republican and democratic camps continued to vote against the project.
"It is quite clear that Washington does not hear you," declared Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Parliament's financial commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, it is not a solution to make money on taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen called the "sceptical board", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed economic professors, among them the three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to be too hasty and carefully examining which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was departing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) due to the crisis of risk credits for the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos announced yesterday.
"In return, we gain election rights in the bank and influence.
And that is what the benefactors and households can appreciate today."
On the other side of the Channel La Manche, it seems that the British government has launched the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Brigley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) constituted loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, he will buy off branches and accounts of clients of the British bank, Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank to be run by the Northern Rock, which the British government has had since the beginning of the financial crisis to re-nationalize.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azur's eyes has long represented his triumph, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor with the charming smile of narcissism get away?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unswerving talent that were his own also kept him away from the powerful category that produces real stars.
But what a runner he was on a long track!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 years of age at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last fatty years of American cinematography.
Less magnificent than Brando, to whom he was like and for a long time he was some rival on the film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and the mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw the whole country in love with self-made man, a fighter in the war in the Pacific, injured in battle, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theatre, in television and in the back of the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who was second in a 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979 and also a sexual symbol, even though he had been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
He also leaves with the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the call of his own show-business, which will remain to some extent mysterious forever.
A decent man, in the noblest sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused a turn of events for movie lovers, while his great role together rivals the black screen of memories.
It defiles more than half a century of constantly transforming American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, the 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation.
From a less ancient past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have come into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, tortured, violent, unforgettable delinquent of Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956 brought Newman into real acquaintance.
Cute gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful pool player in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure created in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, bringing him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face of traveling age, that was him.
And he's back.
In his professional path, different eras compete together.
Young people know him primarily because of the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unusual hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then closed his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several movie legends, which left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its gilds, manifestations and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier viewed him, not without humor, as "a living challenge to subplaying", judging that he too much pressure in his performance on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so gentle.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scoundrels and despairers whose downfalls and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed little of the familiar aspects of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played a major role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sorrow, dedicated his son Scott to an overdose.
His great friend and former associate Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generousness, love of life, these are the main qualities of a dead actor.
If we mention his legendary career, there is also a great civil rights fighter, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of Hollywood's downfall.
We used to see his image on bottles of vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods, which might have seemed rather distasteful to us, although at first it was gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
Newman, rather than besieged by fame, engaged in society until the last minute.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the day, the model citizen.
What was produced in the factory for Zushlag & co. invoices?
Soon, October 8th, he will begin a criminal trial against Janos Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other criminal offences, including the counterfeiting of documents, politicians and their associates are charged with fraud committed in the long term and systematically criminal organisations resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the D.A., they used money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved their tasks by false invoices.
Money from the state and government - a sum of about 65 million forints - traveled partly to the Treasury of the organization Fiatal Balloldal, in part to the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority also informed was that the money obtained in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices that were not the actual countervalue and the commitments made to the association were never lacking.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
Prints on these invoices came from the Jozsefvaros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalas.
The names on which the invoices are to be produced have been decided, inter alia, on the circular road along the northern coast of Balaton, to which Istvána Lados János Zushchlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to visit pensions and restaurants.
They asked for accounts for their consumption, according to which invoices submitted in public competitions were subsequently produced by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and in particular by the Ministry of Public Administration of the Capital.
The invoices were exhibited mostly by István Lados and his associate Andras .
On his "study trip" Lados saw one of the cellars.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, this catering facility was provided for the ninety-member group of Biztos Pont.
Of course, so many people wouldn't fit into this facility at once, according to the company manager.
She was also plagued by formal and content errors invoices issued in the summer of 2002 by a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later by Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The Badacsonytomaja guesthouse had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn’t sleep in it one night, but a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the printing staff with a rich imagination exaggerated when they introduced a company dedicated to hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which the accounts, according to the information provided to the State Agency, did not even edit the documents made available by Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when he was summoned to the D.A. and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the wrong spot."
In addition to formalities, he added, it was not agreed that they had accommodated a hundred people, since they had only eleven rooms that did not have so much capacity.
In addition, the invoice also indicated eating, and their restaurant has not been functioning for a long time.
The zealous invoicing producers did not even believe that the perceived Budapest travel agency organised only foreign travel and the cash payment invoice, which was also inconsistent with the company's invoicing practice, was foolishly cited as a brokering service for Hungary.
Moreover, as the investigation turned out, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents published by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, the company Hotel Révfülöp s. r. did not agree, among other things, on the level of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the stated 25%, but 15% of the VAT, in addition to which only printed invoices were issued by the hotel staff, but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "issuers" corrupted the invoice, for example, by stating to one company how it turned out through the investigation of the state agency, as a work carried out by road transport of goods that the company originally did not carry out on investment advice.
The fact that the invoices issued by Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and XXI associations are false. Šázadi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont also failed because of formal deviations - an inadequate format of the invoice and an incorrect stamp.
As is the case with Ravenna k. s. or Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be made by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time of (2001), when the group from the Fiatal Városért Group was in liquidation, which is why, according to our information, the company’s winding-up commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
The invoices were deliberately exhibited
The second group of invoices is those who knew they were supposed to exhibit a fictitious invoice.
Eséla Budapest Foundation presented accounts for about four million forints for the Armageddon Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Balloldal - Ifjú Socialist.
The head of the company Collab s. r. o. ordered one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account on the indictment.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth about five million forints, which did not have real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organization had already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Other groups of invoicing companies include those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was a designated representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company immediately issued several invoices for the sale of computer technology assets worth about 18 million forints.
According to the data found in the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the cash investment company Cash S. o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company's partner was a man from Romania, who was to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005 also Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredert and accepted their countervalue.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
However, the companies were of benefit to him because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szenthe, who also prepared their charters, he presented an invoice on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generacio connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Agency concluded that Kubatov had come up with 10 per cent of the invoices and VAT.
For the exhibition of fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszagért submitted proposals to the public competition of the Mihalye Tancsicse Foundation (TMA), a community-based organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA presented five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were later found during a home search at the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the count, some defendants are likely to describe the process of production of invoices, as they have already done in the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if he decides to expose everything himself to the chief defendant Janos Zushchlag.
His previous statement is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will expose everything extensively, he has not done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe socialists have made an agreement with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He may have been offended, however, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, i.e. his house imprisonment, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage that they have not yet done, can freely go through or at least wait for the end of their conduct in their homes, he does not have this option.
Trophy Psychology: Why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been able to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and the economy of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people do not want to fall behind in the eBay auction type competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Research was using an experimental auction to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the second group participated in the auction, and the active areas of the brain of the experimental subjects were examined using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but at the auction game, whose important element is to truffle the other side, the whole under the brain’s skin, called stratum, began to function intensely when losing.
This brain area plays, in addition to many other functions, a role in the "self-replacement" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase can be explained by an attempt to avoid a rapid reaction of the street.
To support their theory, members of the research team from a number of economies conducted a financial cross-sectional investigation.
Under different conditions, he was bidred against one partner by three groups.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would get another $15 in reward.
The third group received $15, on the contrary, before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
So the difference between the two groups was that one was emphasized by the win and the other by the loss.
However, members of the "against losing" group were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologist hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena that are visible in auctions of joy from victory and avoiding risk.
After the neurological imaging methods helped us solve the difference between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," observed Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to find a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated, and the reason is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, there is a marked inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the origins of the disease and their underlying diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying diseases: hepatitis A and E intestinal systems (e.g. infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperm, urinary secret, saliva).
In any event, passengers should be protected by vaccination against virus A and B; there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, vomiting.
Then the skin and eye whites form yellowish, light stools and dark urine. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people worldwide will die from a more serious type of disease, liver cancer, and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only 1 out of every 10 infected people is treated medically.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people infected with their disease don't even know, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells occlusion, and so the first symptoms come in many cases up to 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent, in a timely manner, the implementation of a regular depravation.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who have undergone blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease may already prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should turn to a practical doctor if he notices any sign of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infections and preventing cancer.
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, which was organized for the first time by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of their origin and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God works as an analgesic that could have eased the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God’s perception of pain affects a person, reported the British daily Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electrical shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
The technique used to examine the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain management.
Research is the first of a series of studies, attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The exact test was carried out by attaching to the left hand of the test subject a sparking instrument that produced electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to scrupulously observe two paintings: the 17th century Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary and the 17th - century Lady with the food stamp of Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would arouse a certain state of piety among believers, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the first and seemed to them to be a soothing impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner, and during this time they received in four of the following sections 20 electroshocks, while separately following the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were taken care of" and "relaxed, filled with peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain as they watched the religious picture than they did Leonard’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has also participated in research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any powerful image even among atheists, only to find the right photograph.
"We would have to find an image that will be perceived very positively, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
England's Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practification of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," added Wright.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of what effect would it have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they showed them some Madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would it mean to look at the quality of the Virgin Mary to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
On his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find him in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they have been on vacation, what professional examinations are going on and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
Of course, with regard to skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwell dark vision, it is not clear to them the very essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to the confessional Google representative, the company stands even after ten years of secular work only at the beginning of working with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would it actually be for me?" - such seemingly simple questions, however, will not be able to answer the software until they know enough information about users.
Not all internet users well know that the search words are accurately captured during the internet search, even from what IP address was sought and which pages the searchers have moved to.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can for example store their surf history, look back at what they have been looking for and what they have clicked on, which in the long term generates much more directly adapted findings – the same logic will also be based on the Recommendation service, through which the system will offer products and services on the basis of the previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone sees what I'm doing? - they ask users who are afraid of Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the reaction does not create awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only captured, but in justified cases may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which he provided Google with information to the Brazilian government that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the community sites of Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights may still have been able to breathe in May when a hand company in hand with an EFF e-rights organisation successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google cannot be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the Federal Government has successfully fought nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms that it has obtained with a reference to strengthening the adopted child protection law years ago, but has failed to obtain lists of search items for individual users, in particular full lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so controversial: it is scourged by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and their private life will be by starting to use Google services, being exposed to injury, and acting against it with a revolution that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild footprint, gathering together enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation as a bigwig, a "corporations that are now racing", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered to be conquerors of the world because of Windows, however they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by Google, unlike Microsoft, not requiring its users' identification code and not asking for money for its applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software packages act as much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" than the practice of official software.
But it can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with them just one of the most glamorous keywords of recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although they are in the same range for everyone else, we are showing ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, recording music, and can then connect everything to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also write a blog that automatically shows up his latest photo galleries, which he stores on Flickr or Picasso.
In doing so, we can read about a number of exemplar cases that she turns out to be: a friend in the morning when she sees a flood of photos of her mutual friends, she can easily find out who her crazy friend was spending the night with, or the company can fire his employee just because he's on his blog explaining his honest opinions about top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reevaluated today.
The one who lives online life consists of what he shows up to be, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google's monopoly has the option (including Scrooge, which uses Google's search engine, however, deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a large number of people do not intentionally register on the community pages so that they can not be found. Google online applications from text editor to photoeditor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not make up the best possible profile.
Public opinion does not expect too much when Google shows its teeth.
The company has a current value of $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening investment by advertising agencies and services implemented at an ever-increasing rate seriously affect the lives of not only Microsoft but also numerous other software designers.
In addition, however, critical observers find counterpoints of disturbing impression: for example, the top management completely rejected the protests of employees after double the fees for corporate kindergartens, any frequent daily diets of employees were too costly under the management of the company, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google had already bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and would filter out any finding that was contrary to the good taste, in the sense of their agreement, in respect of the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can move the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others fear its system Health, as we can draw up a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous Cory Doctor's novel "Scrooge" describes with Orwell's reminiscences a future in which one can be appreciably well approached only with Google data.
A double killer from Ozde was helped to remove the traces of two young people
Two young people questioned the police in the case of a double homicide in Ozd, who, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to remove the crime's footprints, said the spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of Borsod on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected have suffered and are currently accused of aiding a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to MTI two girls, are being prosecuted in freedom.
Assistance to a criminal offence shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
A suspect from a double homicide in Ozda, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a crime premeditated multiple counts of murder for physical reasons.
During the investigation, it appeared that a 23 - year - old young man owed a 53 - year - old man a higher sum.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditors to a factory in Ozda last Wednesday, where he killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was pre-emptive of the crime, as evidenced by the murder of a gun hidden at the crime scene.
The weapons and the circumstances of their use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros -- about five billion Czech crowns -- was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100 per cent package of shares by the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side even though the Czechs had previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the state is the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount offered to the market in Prague.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the destruction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the Shareholders Agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with about 25 per cent stake, followed by Czech savings with 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from a European perspective
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the European front pages already remind us of the 'second September 11th'.
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster, which is being charged by the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to sew his own side together to support the quick-to-pay bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about September the second.
Part of Madrid's press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, the world economy was brought to the brink of collapse by the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, and the world will eventually pay for it.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after voting in Congress, it is dangerous that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in capitalism history is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
To date, individual states can throw a lifesaver to the money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
Of course, if other banks collapse as dominoes, then neither money nor other improvisation will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move through their national egotism and unify control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the existing monetary institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, reminds Vienna's Der Standard, which fears that, like Americans, they will have to go deep into their pockets and European taxpayers, increasingly real in order to solve the crisis.
The European Union has experienced a crisis that has hit the old continent as a tsunami until it has seriously dealt with it.
"Savers" don't need to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they firmly determined in which case it is reasonable to reach out for taxpayers' money to prevent even greater damage.
An intelligent car mimics the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not for imitation of obstacles in the natural world?
Like a bee.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese fair CEATEC, was inspired by engineers from Nissan squires. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan developed a biomimetic robotic control system such as BR23C, a robotic minia car equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping create a system that can eliminate all precipitation.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is in fact very similar to our safety protection package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, general director of the brand for the field of technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by complex eyes that allow bees to see in all directions in a visual angle of more than 300 degrees.
Engineers were able to copy the function of a complex eye after the idea of a laser long-circuit.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in the 180-degree field of vision, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns into an operation to prevent a collision.
The obstacle is detected during a fraction of a second, then the robotic car starts imitating the movements of the bee and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision changes direction immediately.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in an entirely instinctive manner.
"If that were not the case, a robotic car could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety protection package, within which the collision is now considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
This process shall not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot go upwards, downwards or downwards, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can rotate the wheels.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees in avoiding them, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and slowing down was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, it is an important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, and less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store and react through intuitive logic based on the data from previous manoeuvres, so it uses only a few kilobytes of memory all the time.
He doesn't need a memory with a giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology that can be used for immediate avoidance, which is estimated by Nissan to be able to get into a series of manufactured cars within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, when avoided in the path of obstacles, would lead the motorist to the final goal.
Damned dear child already has a name
The $700 billion bailout package law, which is to be split into several instalments and aims to buy off non-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
Following further talks, which ended only on Saturday after midnight of the Eastern Time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days on a rescue package worth $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, said, according to which only the signing of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson announced the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. in the evening of Washington time (then on Monday at 2 a.m. in Central European time), but no special rise in the stock exchanges did.
On the proposal for a legal norm, the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, to be established by the programme, will be voted on Monday first by the House of Representatives, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"With the progress achieved last night, we are pleased and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme differs, however, from Bush's original administration proposal, in which it was intended that a total of $700 billion would be spent on the purchase of non-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of half of the amount of 700 billion in the first round, which will be used immediately after the Congress decides on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities secured by mortgages that are considered to be inadequate, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special assembly, whose member will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the Congress' next decision.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law, apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time purchase non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and in particular other "eatable" loans.
The ransom may take place as part of the auctions even directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry have informed them.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of means of concern, for which companies will pay a price corresponding to the damage expected.
According to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, up to $700 billion, whether it is a large purchase of bad funds, insurance or the prevention of systemic risks associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the heads of the bank, who are in trouble and waiting for help from the state, can count on the government to reduce their distances - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in the overseas slang.
Only in certain cases will their payments be limited, and these restrictions will depend on the way in which the Ministry provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases during the auction, a tax deduction will be imposed on the gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent directly to the pension.
In the event of direct redemption of non-quality loans, the government will act aggressively in order to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It must be added that the existing agreements on gold falling will not change, the restrictions only concern new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history where the legal restrictions on the remuneration of the Directors-General will be in force," commented the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the banks participating in the programme will be entitled to a shareholding, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and its savings bank are on their feet, they can also profit from this transaction.
The proposal includes a proposal for the President to present to Congress in the next five years setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be reimbursed to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, because this is what the taxpayers' dollars will not protect," declared a Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it was precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who insisted on adopting the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export prices in the industry were higher by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent year-on-year.

Domestic sales prices in the processing industry also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sectors (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in flour and sedary products by 4.6 per cent, in terms of footwear production by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products sector (1.6 per cent).
The price reduction occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as, to a minimum, in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we have measured an increase in prices between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which is of great importance in the domestic industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, notably by the continued influence of the officially established increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic consumption in the individual processing industry, prices increased most in the oil sector (32.4 per cent).
In the fertilising industry, it was possible to see 13,2 % in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products of decisive weight, followed by an 11 % increase in prices.
Price reductions occurred in textiles and textile products (2.5 per cent) and the production of electric machines and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent during the last year.
Prices in electricity, gas and water production and distribution exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7%.
In terms of sector division, the highest monthly increase in prices (0.7 per cent) in the production of tangible assets was demonstrated in August in domestic sales.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0,3 %, in the energy processing and further processing sectors prices did not change due to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices due to the same month of the previous year was seen in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent) in August 2008.
In the consumer manufacturing sectors, we have measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent in material assets, on the contrary, a 1.4 per cent decrease in prices.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, by 3.9 per cent in a 12-month comparison.
Our domestic salary decreased by 1.7 per cent in one month because of the euro, compared with the dollar by 7.1 per cent, compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and 15.9 per cent to the dollar.
Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Gönczová, there is high hope that the US-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around 12 January, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "almost everything matters now only if an electronic system for allowing access to roads is built at sea in a timely manner, with respect to controls".
At the same time, she pointed out that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy has continued to hold talks in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for the merits of the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Party's presidential candidate Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of the two major US parties, on Sunday jointly assured themselves of their support for a $700 billion bailout package, but they are also politicians who demand the demission of the Minister of Finance.
After several days of marathon meetings of the Congress and the representatives of the administration, an early announcement was made on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was concluded on the bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims at relocating the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are considered to be more suitable for both candidates who would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys at the same time as they came to the fore of the economic issue, Obama gained a certain advantage again, and McCain's headline, which he secured after the republican convention of Sarah Palin's nominations for Vice President.
Obama expressed his hope Sunday at the Detroit electoral assembly that the 700 billion package law would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act immediately, responsibly...) to your seats, savings, the whole industry, the stability of the entire economy is at risk," he said before the 35,000 crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview given to ABC television station: "It will be a bit of a hindrance to everyone... but nothing non-doing is simply not possible to go."
As the Republican Senator put it, the proposal sets out the establishment of a committee to oversee the Minister of Finance and the limitations which he has set aside for the top representatives on whom he has insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more important role in the negotiations, but he himself was with the Minister in daily contact.
Parliamentary President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the draft law on Monday.
Overview of the German Language Region
Right-wing camp is unbroken, only voters inside it have become more confident - thus analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats His Father" the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU began its erosion long before his office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and it is these modern citizens that are now turning away from them.
The arrangement of the period is a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process was completed, which could have been assumed for almost ten years: the undeniable hegemony of one country ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed 47.7 percent for the first time since 50 years below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, even in the period so often recalled by Stoiber.
The reason is the modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and is eating up its parents.
The sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a very high rate. Secularizations, educational results, the settlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political implications.
Right-wing camp is undisturbed, only voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more headstrong.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has been most distant from the classical civil levels; people in the free profession, tradesmen, graduates and higher education.
That's why CSU's support is down below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
A conservative Viennese journal is in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The presidents of the parties are restrained in matters of coalition issues" devoted to the confused domestic political situation created by the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the involvement of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not have much time to look at their cards.
The president of SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to deal with ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - in some social countries and in social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice chancellor, has left Fayemann open.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted over for every fall.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted with caution to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition, it is still completely open on the side, these issues need to be discussed definitely within ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Jarokowa: A vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit of Equality, hosted by France, the current President of the European Union, began today in Paris.
Ms Lívia Járóková, MEP for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional bargaining in her message addressed to the plenary, paid attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
He began the summit conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
They have sat among the invited representatives of governments, the European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Euro MPs group, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are forced out of the European labour market primarily by their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma have no secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these links in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma have the right to their European Union citizenship to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their under-quality and separate education," pointed out Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member State, the cohesion of the European Union, with emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, is needed to speed up the processes of school disaggregation immediately, and proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of the utmost importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken down, and the possibility given to Roma children by democratic space must be provided to enable them to participate as full citizens in Europe's future," Járóková demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" the objective of the European Summit on Equality, organised annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the goals of equality and to eliminate discrimination set out at the level of the whole of Europe and of the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the duo-Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the Bavarian CSU.
The president of Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is, as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of vote, will be decided by the party's last weekend of October.
In any case, members of the highly criticized duo have heard that they will not be able to exert themselves in their posts.
So they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "bavorian tsunami" bringing out personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of her career - the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 per cent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, however, its strength was only 43.4 per cent.
CSU was in Bavaria producing 18% of German GDP "self-governance" for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal country still have a key role for the Hungarian economy, a high position, but in the future they will be forced to coalition.
One of the first features of the internal reorganisation is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team, which will launch a probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the monk government with a liberal FDP, with a right-wing group of the Free Voters, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, the candidate of the Free Voters, used the duo Huber-Beckstein to perform the coup, then with the ambitious municipal political process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, Stoiber, who has so far been a fan of background yarns, former Earth Prime Minister and former CSU President, on September 28th, called his political career the most long-lasting day.
On Monday Huber shook a number of sensitive remarks at the CDU address, according to him, they would have been much more supportive of the sister's side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, somehow puts the joint forces on its feet.
According to Merkel, who had difficulty hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions would not have a negative impact on the Berlin great coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the injured CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved 18.6 percent of the worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:positions - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition member entered the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), by the illegalities that took place in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-nation country has long been in need of the opposition for well ten years, the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections, has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who left the constitution following a change in the 2006 elections with a debateable process and the fourth renewal of her presidential mandate, will "allow" several opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODS has thus abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, it was clear that Russia's economically increasingly dependent Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the constantly irritating Russian imports of natural gas, had taken credit and contributed to the improvement of relations with the European Union, where Belarus' political establishment, assessed as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians, did not receive entry permits.
The release was previously highlighted by the OSCE in its evaluation of the electoral campaign to highlight positive developments and not shortcomings - for example, the ban on a third of opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report by the OSCE, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press, especially in order that the opposition could not be present for the vote.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released to freedom and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, when it continues to refuse to acknowledge Georgia's severed South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered these two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one steps back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said our letter, Alexandr Milinevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain the same, even though "she was too anxious to let a single member of the opposition into a meaningless parliament".
In view of the opposition's results, it does not plan protests, rather it tries to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reform.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, they put obstacles to local authorities, but I still see that change is supported by more and more people, even among older people," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'increasing the silence of the cemetery' collapses," according to Milinkovic.
Unlike opposition policy, the Russian election observers were viewed as democratic.
The Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev of the Russian news agency Rio Novosti, said that "people do not believe words but acts", so the absence of the opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, which has established a rotating door on the arrival and departure of employees.
However, as of today, this new measure against the anointed begins to work, against those who stab themselves and then go to coffee during their working hours.
The news against sloths was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Maur Masi Presidential Council.
"The turning door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presentations and more services," the minister said.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
This is reformism," Brunetta also stresses.
We will complete the implementation of the Council Presidency in all buildings by the Chigi Palace.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the staff, the Secretary-General assures them: "It was a joint procedure with the staff and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that, within three months, the absence of public employees for the disease decreased by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people per year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay dynamics – explains the Minister – have doubled over the last 8-10 years due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunette's decree in accordance with a request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration will present today figures on the lower absence from work due to illness – writes the Consumer Protection Association – the nation's 'crucial sloths' is constantly growing.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree."
Taru will be protested in particular against the exclusion of sick leave which depends on activities; the extension of the period during which the sick person can be checked, within what time limits checks will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour injuries, Napolitano: "Resolution prevention"
There will be 2,500 accidents in Italy every day, three people will die and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that we have approximately 1,200 deaths in 2007 as a result of occupational injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the warrant, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths compared to murders.
In order to re-emphasize the attention of institutions, social and information media on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Labour Accidents, set on the second Sunday of October.
"The alarming data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how important the issue of job security is," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the disabled and the disabled for work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his live admiration for the constant common effort on job security, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the victims' families and the participation of the public opinion."
"Naturely, the indignant 'stop' was raised, frankly shared in the face of tragedies, which are causing a stir in the media and public opinion, but daily reality again offers us dramatic cases, even recurring in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives taken in the field of education are of particular importance so that young people facing the world of work gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed, for his part, "that the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolute critical social condition, as it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring this state to an end."
"With regard to the data of the accidents, it seems that they show a positive turnaround, but it does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of the accident is both alarming and alarming," President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli said again.
"We wouldn't want this "strengthening effort" to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, there will be tragedy.
"We believe that there is still too little in general to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can influence this problem.
It is necessary, in our view - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from the school age."
"Another effort is needed - he added - as regards communication and public participation.
But especially there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon, which represents a unique social phenomenon. "
Mercandelli finally declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation anticipated for labour victims and the "removal of support care" to which the system has been given in recent years."
"The aim, therefore, is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneousity or gifting from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, exposed to risk hearing
Listening for a longer time to loud music and using portable music instruments as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to the European Commission's publication today, which in an official report circulated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks Science, which has recently been raised and identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour a day and maintain a device of high volume risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can inadvertently damage their hearing in an irreparable way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"There is a clear risk from scientific findings – the leader continues – and there is a need to react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to review the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and to keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – the executive official of the Eu – confirm that concerns need to be taken, and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, whose origins are portable musical instruments and similar devices."
At present, there is a security European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise are growing.
It is very possible to reduce these damage by looking for solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of the Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity can be calculated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the Commission free for the future of the capital city
Today we start, in March we close, in June we will have sums.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new home behind the Caracall Spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will assess the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with a "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councilman Giannigo Alemanna in June.
"The Commission is fully independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to stress Alemanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political referees who remain Günt e General Council.
It's not about changing functions, it's just about trying to have a place to process a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time frame.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whoever accuses the Commission of futility, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It is up to the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics will burst into tears over everyday problems and on the urgency that occasionally arise.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless business nor a bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not stand for the euro and serve to reflect and involve the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as the starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, so that it is possible to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it needs, and to think in a united spirit of its future."
The future, which, according to the Mayor of Rome, "will not only be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, but also "will include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decided the economy of the United States and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam".
The attacks against Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the nerve: he thinks he'll get to the highest position of the nation, who had two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks do not say much; they are attacks of purely racial origin and do not answer the voter question: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big head start.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper in Mississippi, from the U.S.’s south, wrote a comment: For once in the election booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his voice to.
One page of American mentality, which remained a Scythian until the last minute, will come to light.
Say whatever you want, we'll take care of it ourselves if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, almost certain success of a black candidate seems to be.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, the lives of 4,500 soldiers were saved, and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become for most of Bush's weaknesses.
Whoever takes the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse was felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents openly did not say that they were less concerned about their credibility.
She doesn't feel as isolated as she used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the paper together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists questioned, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as widely as it is understood by the general public.
The American journalist has a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the press is on the wrong track on a national scale.
In the local area there is an executive group of 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the website is going.
The larger publishing industry paves the way for the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of printing.
The "economic pressure", which journalists point out, increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists questioned admitted that they were turning to technology in the hope that for their press, "he would do something good".
The biggest disaster in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that is, the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "safety of work" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
As far as the press is concerned, they're moving 30%.
With regard to "certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation such as Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so the question is to take or leave.
Leaders receive almost always huge salaries and the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month outside of pension and insurance.
As far as vacations are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, up to 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, are often sick within one year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN GROTTAFERRATI, DENMARK OF COPOL
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinauda, has decided not to bring a real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who has requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-offer at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process at his own expense, he obtained a release from his home prison last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this shift (to which he expressed his pm) would allow him to influence his company and to get to the evidence that accused him.
Elite in Danger
This phenomenon appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a large part of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis divides the republican side, constantly more divided among its old East Coast soul, milder, responsive to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to "the one from Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the middle and south states.
A soul that was arrogantly expressed by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this issue is a mere example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be functioning as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in the incubation for a long time, which are tightening in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the renewal, extraordinary market recovery, the dual category of the State-Power in relation to a certain re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but which are mainly accounted for in the budgets of people and families living in the only country, in the only state.
This created a political problem for those who govern it: it means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be significantly out of the game or that it has nothing to add: obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot be decided on a single common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the allocation of funds: when we get into trouble, only the States have economic resources, a lot of financial resources to be able to try to put everything right.
And it also has the necessary means and authority to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances, which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, after all, in full compliance with the increasing importance that the latest economic progress is trying to attach to one factor closely linked to it: territorial ownership.
Paradoxically in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the sieve, increasingly sophisticated technology, amalgamative, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already destined to rule the world, we realized from nothing that our future would increasingly have to contend with such little intangible things as water, grain, oil.
All things who say so may be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded area, the territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has far more cards in his sleeve than he is, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I'm getting to another news item, though, which predicts a break.
Whoever talks about territory, the state, the government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergence phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, realizing that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leaders, particularly economic ones, has proved equally unsuitable and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence, which is trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is an increasing increase in the mass of the population's belief, rather than that their actions are the same as those of the popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of saying that the elite has already overcome their time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership briefly feeds on one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in sudden election "deficits" or in unexpected changes in the collective moods of recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of laborists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps has something to do with it to win the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligences, someone would say their format, have growing problems understanding, that is, representing, which, not from today, is being created in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-energizing, growing, potentially falling too low.
Before this, it would be too much to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can't say that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep the body of a stokilogram glued to the vertical wall with a label of only 2.5 centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American Journal of Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already in existence that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
«The glue base can be seen as a series of tubes laid as an organized pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that enable the animal to ensure perfect attachment.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "slips away from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to air space engineering .
So far, no superheroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to new glue research.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, California scientists presented glue formed from microfibres as hair, which itself cleanses from dust by moving around the surface in order to continue to maintain perfect adaptability.
Medicines: Never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their use changes in the increase or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with certain medications, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm is needed: just one glass of grape juice, orange juice and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, to eliminate their beneficial effects, and to expose patients' health risks.
Grape juice has already been accused of increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
THE IMPACTS – The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in an information bulletin two years ago and encouraged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to take care of what they drink if they are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NON GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that suppress the drugs.
A long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the challenge of Michele Carruby, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These phenomena are usually immediately announced to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will possibly arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative list of medicines you get and if you run into anything unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” stressed the expert for Ansa.
Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize for Economics
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the foreign, economic and political steps taken by Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, on the days Enron failed, Krugman predicted in a comment issued in the New York Times that the second event would, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States, be far more important than the first.
A prophecy that caused few controversy and which, over the years, had been vexed, however, proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked, with the rate of collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, Krugman announced at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Biniko Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "an economist of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of Bush's liberal administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the release of the Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteer workers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window add more, much more substantial, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
The emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, the Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special functions of some models such as allowing to reduce the presentation dimensions of PowerPoint, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility of transferring the PDF component to the graphic design model and maintaining the original appearance of the site.
From this point of view, we can still create documents of "PDF hybrids" that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have tabular processor or text program properties.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: it is possible to work together between different users in Excel and avoid conflicts in changes, and in the text programme each co-worker has one color for comments to make it clearer to identify in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring certain Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should switch to the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/load/3.0.0/download300.html, added to the English version, which has been available since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the subject of freeness can be a driver for expansion in households, it is the business area of the Open Office package that is betting a lot, and it can already count on the various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of a more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw is ultimately a graphic model.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now almost 3 million and 600,000, with a new version, it is possible that this number can be exceeded.
Kohl results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: this is Rakusan Bernhard Kohl, from the team of Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the top T-shirt.
The report was quoted in the pages of the L'Equipe journal.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive on Cera, Epo the third generation, after Italian Riccard Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as him from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the Kochla blood samples belong to those carried out in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the verification analysis confirms positiveness on Cera, Rakusan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohla’s positiveness to the Epo third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he had already informed the results of the Austrian government authorities.
26-year-old Rakusan took the stage of winning after Spain Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansem, and he also won the best top T-shirt.
Immigrants: The New York Times are on the move, is Italy racist?
Italy "as a country of immigrants only in the last house has become the priority destination of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
This transforms a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So asked in a long article of the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case is evident from what the New York Times define as "the paradox of the north": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigration thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
It's not just that.
The new legislation required by the Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the pope and the President of the Republic: "Georio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students with expensive rent victims - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, the renters' unions, renting a single room can cost students up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such dimensions that all layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure," explains the head of the Sunia studio office, Laura Mariani, in this town, the large demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of rising prices that has also spread to residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free manner, not registered, without limited rent, associated leases.
An exceptional intervention is needed for Sunja, which could be price-regulated through the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, from a minimum price of 650 (bande Nere) over a medium value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria).
In Florence there is one bed on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the university, 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double beds.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiens and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in the transportina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, there is €300/450 per bed, between €400 and €600 per room, with the highest prices in the zones of Poliklinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want EUR 250/350 per bed, at least 350 per single room.
Prices are definitely lower in smaller cities, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is the rent for students from countries outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italian.
Good-bye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities are disrupting the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favour of Multiplex.
"A place without movies is as blind as a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documentes what is happening in the large Italian city centers as well as in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multisalals in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosals in central city zones is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the characteristics of real cultural crime.
"It is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotion," says the director of the New Paradiso Cinema, a film that won Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a grand jury price in Cannes, who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness about the way of life that probably the cinema lost forever.
The values obtained by Aneca, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years the door closed 316 cinemas of traditional tip, and the highest account was paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of multiplex is precisely these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 pay more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«Italian procedure has evolved irrationally» says Paolo Protti, President of Anecu, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about insufficient funding for operators: the previous sovereign debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
Sector support would require between €16 million and €18 million a year."
An interesting is the bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closings, which decided to find a starting point by signing a protocol between municipalities and Aneca, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps in favour of operators and the benefits for the public as regards mobility: audiences will be able to reach the restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and in some parking areas.
«This initiative I like» says Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example Bologna by introducing other measures."
However, in order to be able to confront the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema was a topic that was always important: the closing of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to start the "New Paradise Cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the already closed Rialt or Quirinal on Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side.”
Connection between politics and the Mafia group 'ndrangeta, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli."
The charges brought against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgi Dallorion e Rosario Schiavone by the Mafia in Calabria and Mayor Rosarn Carl Martellima, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In irons also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the chief's nominee, already accused of crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," writes the state's representatives, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay counsel to Piromallim.
"This would allow the Mafia group – writes the judges – to officially enter the city offices and facilitate already huge possibilities for control and management of public administration."
Calabrian Regional Commission President Agazio Loiero does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworld are much more important in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangets, heroes who are still undefiled'."
Prisons this morning follow the imprisonment of July last year, by which police have shown that the Piromalli Mafia group has received final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was that the connection between organised crime and local administration was then assumed - local politicians were stripped of their functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrion, president of the Christian Democrats, was elected as the head of the right Wednesday coalition after a narrow election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minnit and accused him of establishing everything for political reasons, but the judges in the Incarceration Regulation signed this morning explain that the Mafia group had even grown up so far as to ask for a change in the A3 motorway project.
From further interrogations directed against Dahl Torrion, writes the public prosecutor, she came out "willing to shift the rights of the entrepreneur, representing some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy comes from the waves, they come in big.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyesight of wheels such as Chevron, who is now trying to reach out to these sources.
The ability to generate energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil decreased around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went sideways, but now environmental organisations and a new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of wave movements.
This amount would be a double energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that bet on marine energy was Energiss, who agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this purpose was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies," said one speaker, who is connected to the U.S. oil wheel, in the Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspaper - and is thinking about opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially given that oil is still in the US in Alaska and that President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, they follow the marine energy trail as well as Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show an increasing interest according to observers.
Technology, the dog needs to be worked out.
Experts are talking about the technology that is still in the beginning, because they do not know what impact marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
However, for more energy production, technologies need to be used with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of paints that are intertwined.
The force of the waves, which moves with the battles up and down, is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these paints.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy gets to the shore with underwater cables.
For the time being, there are four types of facilities in the project phase waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking using six offshore turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of the water during the tide and the tide causes the rotation of turbines, which the generator lives on with this rotational motion.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential for tide and tide, the Institute for Electrical Energy Research said.
Although this is an unrelated factor, the tide and tide are more predictable than the wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely to the energy of the influx and outflow of countries like New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states, that they have already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
