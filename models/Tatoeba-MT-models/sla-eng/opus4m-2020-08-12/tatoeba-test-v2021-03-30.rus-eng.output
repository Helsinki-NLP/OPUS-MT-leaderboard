Can you believe that?
We slept under the open sky.
Don't close the door.

I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can handle the job.

You're two years younger than Tom.
We've got them.
Tom's gonna decorate the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.

Sounds simple.

Put him on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles along this road.
You tricked us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.

The bill, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
It's your birthday soon.
Count it out.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded online.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Have you been drinking?
He is certainly the best fit for this work.
You're making my job easier.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.

I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom takes care of the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They shut Tom off the life support.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry about my French.
What did I just do?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other things.

I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed these cards to my friends.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photo?
Tom gave me both the money and the advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he still doesn't want to sleep.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give that dictionary to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I didn't have time today to do that.
Mary told Tow that she would help him.
Multiple numbers from “person” — “people”, not “persons”.
That's two steps.
You ruined everything!
I think that's why we had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me what the baby's name was.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're a teacher.
Tom will find you.
Everyone's got a weakness.
I hope they pay you well.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I guess I'll be late.
Do your kids speak French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup's giving away fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I taught French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a horrendous, Jewish sense of the Galilean dialect of Aramaic rather than Hebrew, thus showing the inability of claims to have a sacred language that is particularly close to God in prayer.
Eventually, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to get you something to eat.
I'm gonna go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom wasn't wearing a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man like me.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
She had a good idea at the last minute.
There's a lot of air in this room.
Why aren't you in the sweater today?
A pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him if I were you.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems very busy.
And it's very nice to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is this my book?
Rubbish is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't let that make my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to say to them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He reads physics in Oxford.
He kept that fact from me.
Did you save me?
He snores loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do that.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said days would come like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day has come to an end, because of your timely efforts, the people who have tried to help you in your work have failed to put themselves in danger.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in tents on the street.

Mike has friends in Florida.
We were both laughing.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's trying his best.
Why aren't you here tomorrow?
We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't get it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great use to you.
Tell him to be here by half past three.
It's not the god of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it's going to rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where'd you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of starving to death.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I think I'm going to do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some adjustments.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The football player hit the ball.
This book sells well.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that.
Positive nuclear cores attract negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everyone looked at my legs.
Tom was the first to arrive.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not feeling well.
Come to me.
The hotel gave me an account of 8,000 yen per room.
I stopped chasing fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know what my kids want for Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Does Tom have it?
I finally got to work.
Tom in the kitchen, washing dishes.
The temperature is down to three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was overcrowded.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is good for sale.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what that's supposed to do.
Tell her I said hi.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer shook everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is cruel.
I'm having a dream.
So there is nothing to do with anyone but themselves.
I'm from Sidzuoka.
Tom used to burn all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in thirty minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I get it.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.
What did you just come here for?
Postalon's nice.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't take my advice.
Is there something you want to say to Tom?
You don't want a son yet?
How can I lose weight?
I think we should tell him that we're going to be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They were trying to hide their concerns.
There's a big organ in this council.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the light.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never dated anyone above me.
What's the cost of rye flour?
I'd like to have a cold drink.
What do you care?
Each nation has its own special character.
A healthy person doesn't know the price of health.
Did I miss anything interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience was laughing.
You're not paying attention to me.
My ankle's broken.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He is a noble knight without fear or strife.
They hate women.
I don't have much left with me.
Tom was trying to run.
What color does she have?
Go faster!
You're overestimating him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaiian is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was the first one here?
Are you singing in the choir?
Were you home last night?
I was homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
Prices are going down.
I'm glad Tom didn't get hurt.
I've never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine running.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Over and over again, there are obstacles in our lives, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to quit the company.
Do you want to come in?
You and I both know it's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You're just running away from problems.
A courtyard without women like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave a kid alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with this.
I put a bait on a hook.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind was howling.
I've rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.
Tom is learning as well as the other boys in his class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to prepare food for the soldiers.
What happens if we get caught?
I can put things in the box.
I'm going to put order in your bedroom tonight.
He has five languages.
Tom had a tough childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like the way you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There aren't as high a class as Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could count on you!
Tom put wood in the fire.
"Love has never killed anyone." "Really? Ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I couldn't let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving already?
Neither Tom nor Mary have ever been to Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school now, isn't he?
Please let us know.
Tom nodded and headed for the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove me wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Does it hurt anywhere?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why you can trust me.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a shame when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think this might interest us?
I'll think about you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone bothered me.
The river's leaking.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He's definitely coming.
Any messages?
I got a call yesterday from Tom.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.
An accident took their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you bring the towel?
Tell him I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom got on a bus going to Boston.
Falling, she hurt her elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?
They're calling you.
You both made a big impression today.
She doesn't like my manners.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston.
We can't rely on the weather forecast.
She's still young.
Did you follow Tom's advice?
Tom said he's color-blind.
How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you learn English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money on his new dress.
Why is Luna glowing at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You won't need that anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhasransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than me, I don't care.
Is this your first trip to Australia?
The owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
A loser with a break in all three of the networks he's devoted to.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
A pound of fig costs two and a half euros.
There's a lot of animals in the zoo?
She's the pride of her class.
In other conditions, temperature is the most important factor in this experiment.
It's better without meaning than without suggestions!
What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Tom said he still doesn't want to sleep.
What floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have an assignment for Tom.
"How was the accident?" "Nobody knows."
What do you like about him?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Do not believe any of what he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.
She's running.
It's a man.
If the Icelandic language were in color, I think it'd be white.
Do you know where the meeting will take place?
I wish they were happy.
I want to quit my job.
Christianity has many followers.
The carpets absorb the sound.
Tom told me it wasn't possible.
This must be where Tom lives.
Tom's a weird kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I like Ural languages.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes it is necessary to tell the truth.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married on 20 October.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
What would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's studying late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
My girlfriend smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom threw Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold a reconciliation in Jesus Christ of Kingdom power and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went home.
It's not thin, but it's not tough.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
That's amazing.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five in favor of the tellers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Please tell me where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't pretty.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read this before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
They're all doing it.
I often visit relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You must be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in broad daylight.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee very much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is opaque.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll follow you.
Tom tried to drown in a bath.
Tom and I are about the same size.
I said good-bye.
Tom is Maria’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature can change.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Next year, Tom will be teaching French.
I listened to her until the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why does that make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is already behind.
We're gonna miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
I could really use this knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take a minute.
I would like to change that situation very much.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a protein in a wheel.
He didn't make it.
Do you want to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He went skiing in Hokkaido.
“Shut your fucking music and read the book.” “I see my censoring spell still works!”
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You've got blood coming out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join us.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for forgiveness again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never here.
I'd really like to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like this before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought some bread.
Let's hurry up or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they get you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is in danger.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd like a drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
That's why I didn't have to leave.
Mary got better after she got sick.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
Nobody likes me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
- "You told him?" - "No, he found out."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I speak French.
I'm just sure you were just thinking about something.
Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a crying iva.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
You're a cop?
Tom screwed me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
The wind was still at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him so.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Look, don't slip.
Mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just got off the phone with your teacher.
I'm used to lying down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
You know what that is?
Ottawa is Canada’s capital.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go to your father and ask him.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
Members of the tribe moved along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one cares before what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
When are you going to remove the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Is there any point in doing this?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but he's strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find it, please, Toma.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he's a joo.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free, and today I'm working.
Take your coat. lt's cold tonight.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom mad?
What a terrible man!
The cardboard hardens the papers.
Don't be mad at him.
You're way out of your league.
The curse was destroyed.
The great-grandfather Tom was born blind.
Tom above you, isn't he?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's easily afraid.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't scared.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Click the button.
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore boots to her knees.
That's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was very rude.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He's lost his sunglasses.
It's awful bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time, Tom was the first.
They're all different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Plant a tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna make it better.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long handles.
Tom was in sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?
Tom turned off the alarm clock and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I was trying to warn Tom.
The train was loaded.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It'll bring disaster to your family.
I'm very nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary was trying to sell her house.
You should try not to sleep.
My mom's been very helpful.
Tom has a snake tattoo on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?

My father painted the mailbox red.
A lot of people ignore laughter.
Besides Tom, everyone in the family speaks French.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
Do not pay attention to them.
I know you don't like me.
The police found Tom dead on the wing.
I'm not as lucky as you are.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning on buying a house?
On the cat's desk.
Tom says he doesn't want to come with me to Australia.
I came, I saw, I won.
Life isn't always fair.
I saw Tom take your keys.
She was devastated all night because of Tom and Mary's fight.
Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your trip.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe that.
We've seen a lot of unusual plants in the botanical garden.
At times, a small gift may be an expression of great love.
Do you prefer blonde or brunette?
I didn't get on the bus.
That's why I didn't like the movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning a party.
I'll get someone to help me.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
Is that Chinese or Japanese?
Fire.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
French isn't that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was gray.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
Will you take the train?
That's what we think.
How could something like this happen?
You're actresses.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and legs are always freezing.
How can I translate words that are not in any language other than mine?
Could you put this on tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom's very angry with me.
I used to wash my head once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I won't lie to you.
Coffee's on me.
We're husband and wife.
The Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
In October, leaves begin to fall.
Melanie said she liked to swim.
What saddened you?
I'm too busy to talk to you right now.
The captain runs his ship and his crew.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where did you share the screwdriver?
Three prisoners escaped.
Praise be to Allah!
Do you think Tom knows?
This time I'm crying.
Tom acted like a child.
Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were a romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do this right now.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to confess to.
Tom was expected to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Do you speak Greek?" "Not yet, it's my first lesson!"
Why did you give him money?
Tom bought something for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you talk her into it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She's always up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the very depths of the audience.
You'll live.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman as president?
He came to see you.
I'm glad Tom did that.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's a cookie I baked for you.
England is like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
The bark of that dog doesn't scare the baby.
Don't resist.
Tom has keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the upper arms to get up.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do whatever he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us the anecdotes.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
A lightning bolt struck the tree.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the caste.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it hard to learn Greek?
Tom's coming with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You speak Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't hang up.
Tell him to stay out of sight.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
Do you want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I don't have the strength, I'm working from morning till night.
What time are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He aimed at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to move on.
She stuck her nose in the glass.
In English, the verbs cheese and estar do not differ.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Texting, driving, very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you take off your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The black fairy was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fomo to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to be wasting my time.
I was very calm.
Everybody's got something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I told him you came to Australia.
Is that what you were looking for?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where can I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a snowstorm.
The book on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against desire.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom hardly ever asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told you Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long has it been since you've been here?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning on going to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which one's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than I am.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't love your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much taller than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Foma's gone off the door.
My dad's an English teacher.
On Christmas Eve, Tom and Mary gave their granddaughter a bicycle.
Hold on to your laundry.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate it into French.
How many glasses on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she's innocent.
Maybe.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom recently got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know what you'd do for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can a vicious circle be used in evidence and is highly appreciated.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I was speaking to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and I couldn't get these morons to understand their own language.
Should I leave?
I was stupid enough to believe that.
She really did it.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours, my mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
Owls are nice.
Tom's illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of a job.
We're perfect for each other.
It's French, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris away?
How long has it been in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frieda Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there's gonna be snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to use the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you if you pay me the same.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance like that.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to be paid to me.
She's got a crush on her.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's pulling Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazyest one I know.
Mary's already gone to her room?
This time I'll forgive him.
I like Chinese food very much.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuelan.
Here's the count.
He insulted me publicly.
Tom won't win any more.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for direct heating.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out now.
May I take a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to be married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I certainly didn't know where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom burned the bling.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much is it?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
A glass of rice weighs about a hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger, Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom for half-third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tataeba all languages are equal.
The infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Run, you pussy!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
It's a huge network.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say this movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no invincible ones.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're messed up.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you move her?
Does Tom speak French?
He learned Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, we'll go to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated it seemed.
His gray eyes sparkled and sparkled, and his usually pale face revived and was covered in yellow.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands are blue with the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to engage and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children prefer to play than to learn.
He was accepted as his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking politics.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
Did the mustache suddenly come into fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to waste so much time on it.
You're indignant.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's costume is the pirate.
That's the truth!
Let's go to the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
That's why I had to invite Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you a fan?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She's become a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he thinks he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezubius, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
You had other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gess.
To tell you the truth, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought to trial, it is generally accepted that twelve persons be present in the jury court.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
It's been another day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to get an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom plays trombones.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world famous for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these spirits?
The castle's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want what's best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self - esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice faced, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war, a tumultuous noise, sharp enough to break her drums, and loud enough to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published each year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My car's broken down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That rock was so heavy, I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom asleep?
As it turns out, it will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look up to the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
Opejana climbed a tree.
The language I'm learning is very difficult.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can't you solve that question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Soto do that?
In the twenty-story building.
If you're not coming, I'm not going either.
You don't happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you gonna give something to Tom for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he'd followed my advice then, he'd be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as an ass.
I think we can count on you.
She knew she wasn't right.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary was bringing her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell because you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little tendon.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd better stay.
So a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place reliable?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect that's why we have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go on foreign soil.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom stopping?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
There's a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom's here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's a lion.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of a rat?
How long do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it much.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped him do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These gems are precious.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be an opening.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Fom's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I were crying.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a minute.
Why are you so undressed?
Milk can be used to make butter, cheese, and so forth.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her cousin?
When you drink water, don't forget the ones who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary's happy.
I know you want to see them.

Tell them we're going.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?

There's no answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I had a negative headache.
Tom, you're on the phone.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do it.
Tom told me he was coming back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
It's a box of holes.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.

I woke up and she wasn't there.
We have a lot of food today.

I went to the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
Bear black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard to approach the President.
If you're hungry, you eat.
I was terrified.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six-three is eighteen.
"Scala" is an anagram of grace.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a rally against racism.
You did it fast.
I need to take the clock two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.

I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I sell clothes on the Internet.
I could've done it faster when I was younger.

They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hat.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.
That's a lot to take on.

There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take your medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.

I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train will take about two minutes at this station.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think the safest place would be?
I know your father.
I heard you scream.
He's the boy who drew this painting.

Last night, the temperature dropped below zero.
“You can’t wear it.” “Why not?”
Tom didn't do well.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean that reflects my dreams.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer to walk, not drive.
As it turns out here, it's impossible to know.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't recognize her at first.
The number of votes was fabricated.

I think we're almost ready.
My wife came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?

She's above her sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
The most beautiful colors have the sharpest spikes.
You'd better hide.
Tom follows the instructions.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What color do you like?
She says she's feeling very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom does not know how Iraq differs from Iran.
So they said not to do it.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I've been waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
He saw the helicopter himself and took a swing.
I'm with you.
Do you want to end up like him?
I've been thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
It's almost your turn, Bashar!
You're useless.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I went to Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom's gonna be working this weekend.
Please tell her I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s efforts to tighten arms control were intertwined with powerful weapons lobbying.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to put it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've had enough time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud of my father's good cooking.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain the situation to Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one was paying attention to me.
That's why there were 13 at the time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're bigger than Spartacus!
That's how he came to be.
Why did Tom need him?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bitter.
There wasn't enough time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network, gear up.
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networks provide information about a person before meeting him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What is the point of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black spots can be removed.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his lazyness.
Tell me you're joking!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom got expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than I am.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleared the street from the snow.
Tom and Mary should do it together.
They offered to help us.
Tom decided to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are great friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's kind of a celebrity.
Jimmy knows all about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting's hanging on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want that dog.
Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
I've prepared Tom's dinner.
Russia has become the second superstate.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Spread this powder in a glass of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those lunches that are sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for an apartment in Manhattan is about $4,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only survivor.
Are you going to buy that car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have any siblings.
Let's see something else.
You think that's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to be done here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to consider his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You're not gonna turn off the radio?
I definitely don't remember what Tom said.
Tom's an expert player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom's got a vivid imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?
Yesterday you left the bar just the moment I was going to put everybody's drinks at my expense.
Tom told me it really worked.
I want to play chess.
I support you by 100 percent.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate to wait.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these photos?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him off his feet.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
You're the only one who can handle the money.
How does it relate to each other?

Tom couldn't concentrate.
I like this place.
Tom doesn't have any money for a new car.
I didn't know what happened.
They can't escape.
Obviously, you've changed your mind.

There's no calories in the water.
I think we should get them to work.
He doesn't need advice.
Did you go to the store?
Please help me translate this document.
Tom's acting kind of mysterious.
It'll cost a lot more to fly the plane.
I know both Tom's brothers.
That's a big help.
I hope you're lucky.
Tom and Mary have changed a lot?
I don't know when he'll be here.
Since Tom's leaving for Boston tomorrow, today's our last chance to give it to him.
Tom and Mary don't want to dance.
We won't need it.

Put my name on the list.
Tom escaped from prison through a tunnel.
I wanted her to win.
Order it now.
What crime did they commit?
In a fit of rage, he hit the table with his fist.
I want to tell Tom myself.
Give me some time to think about it.
Could you send me more information by e-mail?
Let's talk about anything but that.

Tom's not like us.
Thank you for saving me.
Tom said it wasn't the only reason.
Is that mine?
It's a tower.
Who taught you French?
I don't think I can fix it.
They say the mayor's taking bribes.
I don't have any feelings for her at all.

What are you doing?
I've never seen her help my father.
That's how I know her.
There's nothing more I can do.

The train station is ten minutes away.
Who are you to decide that?
Look at the cat.

Nothing compares to ice cream in the summer.
I saw her play the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like driving?
The car wasn't moving.
Mary knows she was wrong.
This skirt is too tight.
We'll try to keep calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke fast.
So Mary was not to be deceived.
The baby's in the crib.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom wiped out the offer and rewrote it.
You could've been hurt.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you're working.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary wouldn't let him.
Tom hasn't done anything all week, he's just complaining about Mary's pain.

I'd like to be Canadian.
It only happens sometimes.
We all pray for Japan.

Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You're free to do whatever you want with your money.
Do you want anything?
She left before I got home.
Tom wasn't the only one who got arrested.
You could at least knock!
You're only making things worse.
I think you should get some rest.

Tom needs you very much.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Papiamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to cut my hair.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember what they're all called?
I'm eating couscous.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom changed his mind again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine is good for sale.
Her clothes got a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he wasn't right.
They were pulling lots to go first.
Maybe we should ask him about the road.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said it was cold.
I like spending time with my friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.
If you take the baby out and point your finger at the moon, the baby will look at the moon, and if you do the same with the dog, she will look at your finger.

I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.

I suggest you put the comma here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do it.
She's got a very tight schedule.
Tom speaks French, too.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
Tiger lilies flourished in the garden.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
We're here to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in a toy box.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, everyone ignores me." "Next!"
He's got one goal in life: making money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
You have a letter.
Grandpa Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the mike.
Tom spent the night in a hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom's indecisive.
A nuclear baton!
I'll postpone my departure if it rains.
It's got to be perfect.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
It'll cut my ears.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
When mixing the three main colors, you get black.
Get in the mood.
What time do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want the neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
Is Tom still going to be in the hospital?
I want you to be with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You have to respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I'll pray hard.
What will you do if the war starts again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold fever is the California gold fever, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I get to know new people every day.
I want to go on a date with him.
You let Tom down.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom terribly.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's suggesting you do that.
I forgot that it's April 1st.
Please stop singing that song!
Toma was bitten by a dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The river divides east and west.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Is that why it was so scary?
Tom invited me to stay the night.
I don't think it's Tom's fault.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do this.
If the ice warms up, it breaks.
We could have done it.
The doctor said that that's why we need surgery.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who's gonna knock on my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to see you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so stubborn?
He stuck himself in his Chinese language teacher, but with all this hormonal stuff, he stuck himself in almost every other person he met.
I'm happy to let you know that I'm fully recovered.
I've written a lot of proposals for Esperante.
I like the aquarium better than the pastel.
I can't make an exception.
He thinks fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to an attorney.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father loves a fisherman as much as I do.
Hey, it's me.
Dan has proven himself to be a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better at cooking than I am.
He swims like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to buy it.
She brought the broom.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father’s successful car business.
She's in the sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus minus gives you a plus.
In the basement of a corpse.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel alone.
Ankara - the capital of Turkey.
I went to the gym.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane’s farewell speech grieved us deeply.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You're looking gloomy.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't help but smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is a recognition that you didn't even know what you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought it through before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's faded.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come too?
Does Tom make enough money to live in the city?
Interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He did not seem sure of his answers.
I've heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There's so many of them.
He could not give in to principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You'll probably have three hours to do that.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anything.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's exactly what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
There was nothing wrong with my mind.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He was jumping from one theme to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I accidentally put on Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned all the way back to the small ones.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Be a little bit.
I want to talk to you about something.
Bank's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather great?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take off the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't make me kill you!
Do you like it better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
You're not hurting us.
You may not answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you tell the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
You really want me to tell him that you killed his father?
I got a call from your teacher.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were moved by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I have a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom's my friend.
In the hope of remaining ignorant and free, the nation expects what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't know the color.
Tom poured the water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are good animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you find Tom lazy.
We need to tell him not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's a sight for sore eyes.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
So it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something has to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's staying in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That's the second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom's a close friend of mine.
Don't do two cases at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom's asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repeated.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I almost forgot about the congregation.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to the neighbors about the noise.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As soon as you meet New Year's, you'll spend it.
There's not one book in the library in French.
Every summary is dangerous, especially that.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write that as a hiragan, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you the way I do.
Act like you're old enough.
Can you juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't stand animal suffering.
I think Tatoeb's stalling today.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is a mess.
The conference room is now busy.
Potato chips are bad for your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's tired here.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Get the rope!
You've spoken so often yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken into orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war starts?
I told them the bank didn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sympathetic to Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Papers on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill must be paid to the first number of the next month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an extortion attempt.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The argument ended with a fight.
I didn't take it.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave a message.
You chose the wrong person.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
They canceled the meeting because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a mule cart on the way.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents, and he speaks English with his parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
It was hard to find Tom.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you lack patience.
Several events marked the dawn of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be said.
He got out of bed.
Trains follow schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are a lot of people who think it's impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam gonna be today?
What motivates you?
He gave Leila his computer.
Roll up your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can become president, but it's probably not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
First on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long before the train arrives?
How long before this train arrives in Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were dating each other.
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm.
I baked him a cookie.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Put it in French, please.
Get the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
It's Tom who told me what happened.
Hair and stuff.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's everybody's favorite.
Compare your answers with Tom's.
Tom has a weak heart.
That's why I have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't get it at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows his flaws.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are a lot of broad avenues in this town.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got flaws.
I wonder why that's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one from Boston.
Will you back me up?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
Titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting's been delayed.
I'll recognize you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Soo a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get it together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him at home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy was running to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
She received the highest marks.
Tom can get hot.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do this.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of an outside domocrat.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me some notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
Now it's only half past nine?
Tom went to the store to buy some milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look so good.
She took her own hands to warm them up.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
My car's covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I talked her into marrying him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane got into the hold.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary fainted.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hello," said Tom.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running away.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the congregation.
I've been somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: one day he'll be transferred.
You can't get a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We're related to him.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started winning in her new office.
Let us take care of that.
I believe you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
My parents don't like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I hold your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to be worried about kissing.
The show needs to start watching when all seasons are over!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go skiing?
You were in the hairdresser?
It's a devastating prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the balloon pen.
The only way to find out what happened was to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
Everyone knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to release the brake.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was blown up.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you have children yet?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
They like them, Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom's a cocky idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks throwing away products is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
That's the nicest thing I've ever met.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
You know that boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The thief will steal the cow.
Tom's not a good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was nothing but a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to come to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me for who I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily's lips?
Why don't you go over there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I need to stick together.
I've heard nothing but good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare to us.
I saw the car blow up.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never dump my PlayStation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I like going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to bother him.
The officer gave his men the courage.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like this right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've cooked meat at home in a grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom's got to be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you, I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple of acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalog.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Do you take a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus took the holy fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get off the bus before it burned.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars died in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Oh, you're so bored here." "My boy, everything is trying for this world..." "Here I am! Your Majesty, Hanon and his servants have taken the island of Koridaj." "Hmm. What can we do..." "How can it be written that only Linc can resist Hanon"? "How can we do that?" "How can we?" "How can we?" "How can we?" "How can we do that?" "How can we do that?"
Do you know who sings that song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're good at this.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?

I saw the boat sink.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll back you up.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not for sale.
Who's your neighbor?
My father usually watches TV after dinner.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut off your apple pie, I made it for you.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it in time if you leave now.
There was no particular problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin pills from my headache.
You're in my heart.
He robbed me to the last penny.
Don't laugh!
Love doesn't obey anyone.
If you come to Tom now, you'll probably catch him watching TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to hurt them.
I'd better go look for them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made a selfie without a shirt.
Whose kingdom was this church built?
We'll be able to put you in jail soon.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
This is Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your glasses.
The rainwater's leaking through this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
No one's suggesting you do that.
He works for this company Monday through Sunday.
Mary forgot to shut the car down.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting with John in the same cell.
I didn't want to swim.
He had a beer.
In our time, it's hard for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Toma, wake up!
I'm gonna tighten my nose.
I did what I promised them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She went out of her mind and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The rabbits are very sweet.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What are you trying to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burning rubber?
This isn't what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom ran Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom's patient.
She didn't buy any bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's gonna try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's gonna go deaf.
Tom said that wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad to the party.
Her hair's wet from the sweat.
I'm just buying soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The onboard guide is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, isn't he?
All the rocks in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her.
I've got it all worked out.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in a room with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix this, aren't you?
I don't know how to hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical sign for bromic acetic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a courtier.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
Are you planning on staying long?
We had an emergency meal, and we left right away.
There's a big garden out back.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start each meal from the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The ring was opened.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to see you all to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me I wasn't sure.
May I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's take the car.
You're distracting me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach is coaching this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What made you think I didn't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you like to eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday party.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
Elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native French language.
It's not a fancy coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought that book.
Naiveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom's kid lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She's been quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very nice, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep in cradles.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
The one who never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when it snows.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've got my imagination on.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine translation.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
Prisoner released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that they made a mistake.
It's a soft climate in Japan.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that one day I'm going to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom just pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain's stopped, we can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna leave when the phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always step aside from the road to the right.
We're asked to introduce ourselves in a row.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing as relaxing as a hot tub.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice like a melodious siren song for me.
What about being married?
I thought Tom might help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like her.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French is not getting any better.
How can I best get a passport?
You may be able to help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom hasn't been paying attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's more light out there.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but it's gonna be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is that a big one?
This medicine will help you.
Cut the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't trust anyone.
She's a fan of Sex in a Big City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted this.
Take good care of him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What's the matter?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom used to say.
She cut her face when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
That peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom's not thrilled about that.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost inconceivable that a scientist of this level would make such an elementary mistake.
He doesn't have any evidence.
You don't look so good.
He used to swim very well when he was young.
I'm writing to my friend.
He's very good at tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the kitchen upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
That's why I don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like adventures.
Tom's in the library.
Were you in school at the time?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who that was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
There's gonna be a heavy snowfall tomorrow.
We decided to postpone the meeting for the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnivals.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom's muttering.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
So Mary and I need some rest.
He went to bed.
It could've been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I sleep a little.
You'll get there someday.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom makes three times as much money as Mary does.
I've been drinking milk.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to cooking, no one compares to Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg in the shark attack.
I baked it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we can.
Next year I'll be three times your age.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's a little above Mary's.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue fits your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do that.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up the guitar game.
Now I'm married.
It was just a few times.
This time you've come too far.
It's working.
You're going to see Tom before you leave?
Nothing surprising, Tom replied.
We want to rent an apartment in the city.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches above Mary's.
I'm glad you suggested that.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when you were a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why does he need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a second-hand car instead of a new car.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's breaking up.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give them to him.
Run, or you'll get arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it his policy to meditate every morning.
Have you checked your calculations?
He tried to make a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I went to see Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom actually meant.
No one understands me.
There are so many stars in the sky, I can't count them.
Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask you to do anything a few times.
Let's wash the dishes tonight, whoever loses the paper scissors!
I'm so unhappy!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He ran and spoke Russian — at least that's what he told me.
Tom is a third-grader.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall dad.
The train was overcrowded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You don't know Boston well, do you?
The band started playing.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
She's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?
Tom didn't want to be a rat.
He was born at 7 a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We only have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has made a remarkable impression.
I helped carry those bags.
They've got plenty of time.
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he's gonna say yet.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife all the time.
Finally, she succeeded.
It's outrageous that they weren't insured by the fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The exam was broken into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Oh, you're so boring here!
Reading a book is comparable to traveling.
Tom saw Mary go into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
A Japanese man would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
There's a lot more we can do.
Give me one, please.
I don't bring naughty children.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She has demonstrated her talents.
I wish that could be possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky to be alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play the lead for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been serving seeds all day.
From the accent, I realized he was American.
Maybe that's the problem.
Was that a joke?
Mercy!
Tom obeyed.
All the people of my generation feel the same way.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke rules many lands.
Well, at least you're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It's not going to end well!
He looked like he hadn't eaten in a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
If it's not a home sale, then maybe it's a new way to get to know the girls?
Tom got the coin.
Why aren't you in your room?
If there is no God, all is permitted.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your seatbelts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've waited a long time for this.
I rejected the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It'll take too long to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
You built all this yourself?
I look forward to a summer vacation.
Can you put it another way?
From here on out, he looks great.
Wooden houses are easily set on fire.
Let's roll Tom's party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
It's very comfortable to bleed.
I'll make a report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a hoax.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for his arrival.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoe size.
I need to think this through.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to make it right.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in her skirt.
What bird can't fly?
This has to end.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexey?
You look like a girl.
Here are some photos.
What's going on on Channel 10?
I hate spinach.
Mother's making lunch.
Tom is a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to give in to emotion.
We were shocked to hear of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just noticing the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your own fault this happened.
It's like clockwork.
I know where you're going.
You catch it all in the summer.
Let's roll it up.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing that.
The janitor interrupted the conversation.
It's on a cat's desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a heavy smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I wonder who'll help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has hereditary illness.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can help you with?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
Investigations started last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What made you think you couldn't?
We drove back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you out of your mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's throwing his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking to a calf at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
Yeah, anywhere you want.
They didn't make it in time.
It's now seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said that to Tom.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
Dinosaurs died long ago.
I usually go up the stairs one by one.
Tom's got it for another year.
I'm at the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom, get out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You're gonna pay for what you did.
I'm going to lose everything today.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom only learned to drive in his 30 ’ s.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon adjust to the village life.
Keep the bucket close to the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
There's a river deep down here.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you this a hundred times.
I'm so cold.
Perhaps you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
To write words separately when they are to be written in a sloppily and in a large way in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the leftover rice?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left shortly after that.
This book is worth reading.
Tom and Mary took the classes before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The wife's not a boot. You can't get off your feet.
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
I teach Tom French.
I like learning other languages.
Mary's got curry eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom is planning to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
What did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like the fruit.
Tom lied.
He's a car salesman.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate the rooster.
They were shooting at me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave the gun to Mary.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first ones to get on the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
This must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.

Now I understand.
Give me time.
Do you want them to help?

I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said she was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.

Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer Mary's questions.

Someone sent us a gift.
Tom and I have been married for three years.

How long later did Tom die?
Do you play guitar?
We hope that we will not need to do so.
We've got the situation under control.
Who's there?
