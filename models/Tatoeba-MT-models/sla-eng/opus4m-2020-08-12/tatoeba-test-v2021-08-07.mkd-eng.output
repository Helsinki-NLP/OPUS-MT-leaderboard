I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound ridiculous.
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit him in the jaw.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three brown spoon sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I gave up.
I'm growing livestock.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like the wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I love learning French.
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you've made.
I flushed one.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd get it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something wrong?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism — Religion or Philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes calorie?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everybody happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I took my head off.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I should go get changed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed my room.
Are you cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatojeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on his face.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a slaughter.
I slept in the coon.
I slept on the bus.
I cut my sandwich off.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this wonderful?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasm?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this right in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to bend over.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I suspected.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't have caught you burning and you being the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
There can be no coincidence.
So, no, no.
It can't be!
It's up to you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It would be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
Doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
I'm on it.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to deal with.
It had to be made.
It must have come from somewhere.
It's up to you.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It's nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what it's like.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake if you borrowed Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's callous.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a clepidal.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a cripple.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink the water.
We better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're getting close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what interests me.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I've been thinking about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was getting hurt.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom was gonna want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
I thought you'd found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
So don't you hate him?
I thought he was tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you could swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than I did.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the toilet lid up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna finish my job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not that cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong for me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday, my head's shot, and I'm so hungover.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
It's healing me.
It worries me.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
Maybe he's acting weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it'd be hard to pull it off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm out.
I came back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It probably won't be worth the wait.
It rained two days ago.
It resulted in a lot of difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
I sincerely regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's about to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended that you check for any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medicine that you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's about to leave.
It's so much fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
We're on foot.
It's a simple matter.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They've torn it apart.
It's just a pain in my ass.
It's been raining for about a week.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's extremely warm this week.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
You'd better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's closing time.
Study here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than then to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily tell them apart.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's how you need it.
It's evil to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's getting dressed.
It's sinking.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get even colder.
It's gonna happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
That's good.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel that someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
Doing so without much help will not be easy.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's not a big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not a regular pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds really strong.
Sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's stupid.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's hot!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark out there.
He's still on the market.
It's still working.
It's still not right.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spiced food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
It's so strong.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
This heat is not maintained.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very easy to understand.
It's warm in here.
I don't know. I'm guessing.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would last.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned down Tom.
It was an honor to be asked to give a talk.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It's been an arena day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
It's been an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
Such conduct was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
It was fun yesterday.
He's been sleeping all night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I had sinned.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been proved that fleas living on dogs leap higher than those living on cats.
It was so magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
It was so cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He blew a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unimaginable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Butter.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
That's not gonna help.
He's doing a good job.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you right away.
I used to look after you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I'm already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything I needed written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed by something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been briefed.
I got robbed three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.

You're my lucky man.
You're my pride and joy.
You're not Japanese.
You're not Canadian.
You're not invited.
You're not following.
You're one of us.
You're proud of peacocks.
You're under oath.
You're wandering.
You got in front of them.
You asked me to help.
You're baking bread in your ovens.
You beat her.
You're borrowing books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these suggestions in mind.
She can be trusted.
You can chain me up, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
You may leave now, sir.
You can leave and stay - whatever you want.
You can handle it.
You'll manage.
You can handle this.
You can have mine.
You know how to recognize children's voices without problems.
You can make your job easier.
You can rest.
You can sit down now.
You can stay in here.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
You can study here.
You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny that.
You can't deny that.
You can't do what you think.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
You can't help us now.
You can't leave a baby alone.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that happen.
You can't marry Tom.
You can't prove anything.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're getting the data fast.
You're cooking a turkey with a light bulb.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could've said no.
You'd make a great mother.
You better ask them first.
That you've found them.
You better go help him.
You'd better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You'd have done the same for me.
You did a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about that, didn't you?
You've already done it.
He did his best.
You don't need to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You got hurt, didn't you?
Do you happen to have a key?
You ain't got no idea how long.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
That's my dick you know.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't need to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything rusty.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't know business.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not actually big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You go pick up Tom and then come back.
You guessed one thing.
You're wrong, people.
You guys were right.
Your hair is broken.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
You got a guilty conscience, don't you?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You've been a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have kind eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I pay you my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay as far away from him as you can.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very nice lips.
You have very perceptive eyes.
That's right.
He just got back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Kids, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your pretty eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You want your life, don't you?
You're gonna be okay.
You'll get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be famous in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get them back.
You're gonna get a mustache.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're coming with me and a dot!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're gonna have to study harder next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit tight.
You'll never find her.
They'll never see you at that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
She looked beautiful.
You look familiar.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look really good.
What's wrong?
You look imagined.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave your word.
You're disturbing me.
You might be needed.
You can go anywhere.
You might have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
You must have made it very easy for you.
You must've jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show up first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You've got to watch the kid.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You've got to study hard.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You need to buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You should make him listen.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.
You didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth every meal.
You should go to a dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints have upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fed up.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're such a hater.
You're acting weird.
You're a good girl.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You're really good.
But you lied to her.
You really need a shrink.
You really should have let me get a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're such a nerd.
You're smart.
You're a discerning man.
You're a wise man.
You're mean.

You're experienced.
You're right.
You're beautiful.

You're doing great.
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
You're hurting me.
You're not talking to me.
You're impressive.
Now you're in charge.
You're in power.
You're incompetent.
You're influential.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're weakening something.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
You're gorgeous.
You're disturbing Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that horrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You're out of alcohol.
You've got too much work to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a tight-ass.
You're perfectly safe.
You're really sweet.

You're very passionate.
How negative you are.
You're a little rude.
You're kind of rude.
You're so stubborn.
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
You're such a nerd.
You're such a pig.
You're supposed to be helping them.
You're teasing me.
You're terrible.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
You're the only one who met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.

You're welcome to wait here.
You're among friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're wrong, Tom.
The eyebrows look strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good to remember.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse is pretty accurate.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is ugly.
Your role here is so important.
Your policy is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are quite handsome.
All your stuff's here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's been unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call you when I was in the car.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were gonna text me the other night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to already know the answer.
You look like you're getting cold.
Looks like you have an infection.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to say.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You should ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Don't overdo it.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You should eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You should get a good night's sleep.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.
You should go to bed early.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
You should pay your rent in advance.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try writing your respects.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you're driving a bike.
You should write Tom a thank you letter.
You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very safe.
You made your ankle.
You're so beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're in reverse.
They've drunk you.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
We missed you.
It was of great use to us.
You're right from the start.
You've been making white again!
You bought Mary something.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
You've gone too far!
You have a rash.
You've got enough to worry about.
You got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me give Tom a message.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You've made Tom miserable.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been putting this off for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to survive the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not like you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You were great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the painting.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna win.
You worry too much about him.
I wouldn't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
