Welsh MPs are concerned that they "will look like Muppets"
Some assembly representatives were shocked by the proposal that they could be called representatives of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans for the assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentary representatives from all political perspectives are concerned that they could become the subject of a mockery.
An MP from the Labour Party said his group is concerned that the term "simulates with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on Welsh twp means dumbass, and pwp shit.
A parliamentary representative from the Wales Party (Val. Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group is "open" to change the name, but that the MPP in the speech can quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is pronounced similarly with the pronunciation "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee that is currently preparing the law to introduce a change of title said: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will be titled will be on their own."
The government law of Wales in 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that came across broad support for changing the title of parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what will be called MPs in the assembly, the Committee has been favoured by the term "members of the Welsh Parliament" or the MWP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Parliamentary representatives propose alternative options, but a struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who are expected to submit a proposal for a change law within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, the MPs will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on country name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in title is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced as churches in Harlem struggle for survival
"The older people I spoke with said that in the past a bar and church could be found at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today there is neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People are hanging out in another way today," he said.
"The bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay."
When it comes to churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think it will "be found again sooner or later".
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments that would accommodate people who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "so the day will come faster when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who moved into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Church of Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held services nearby, took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the helm leading a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since Reverend Johnson's parishioners had planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called carillon “the bells of the poor. ”
The expert who played carillon in July used the second term "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who has been playing on a larger carillon at Riverside for 18 years.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's been going on in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which have been brought by layman church leaders and other episcopal dioceses.
The sacristy, the parish’s governing body made up of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July because of concerns that the diocese would "try to shift costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old during a dive for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour and a half Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then drove the group to the attack site to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was about excitement over the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn apart.
"I made fun of everyone coming out of the water: 'A shark is in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for the purpose of conducting the investigation and safety of the bathers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition of chains such as Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of shops and engaging specialised sellers.
As part of a large entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow in parallel with the decline in sales on the market of clothing and home equipment, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 shops across the country and extended to additional stores next year if proven successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use the space on shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the number of cosmetic products offered to 3000 products, including for the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
And the existing range of companies L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those of Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first to be opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second to be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network purchase and return to daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, said that the outlets would look more and more like stores as this supermarket chain tries to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced Argos outlets into hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because it bought both chains two years ago, making it hard to sell food and making the acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s joined a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended in a dispute over the distribution of income from the pharmacy in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical work in 281 Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including in four stores a range of luxury leather care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks Commercial Director Sainsbury said: "We have changed the appearance and impression of our cosmetics suits to give our customers a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in the special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and accessible locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change of old purchasing habits."
Peter Jones "sad" after Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract
Dragon star Dan Peter Jones left to "kiss out of rage" after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer chain and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The host of this Morning (37) show on Instagram announced that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon star with Peter Jones to cook out of rage by pulling out of a joint profitable business at the last minute to focus on her new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "angry" when a gold girl television during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant that there was no longer enough time to devote to their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
This job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was one of Holly's biggest priorities.
This should be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to step down amazed everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
There's a lot of goods at Marlowe's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning, one of the stars in Britain’s most profitable investments, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in the products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes and the possible additional delay in starting the line.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three kids Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as chairman of the board in March.
Couples spend vacations together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV show I’m a celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked at the expense of criticism he would receive in the paper because of comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and because he had such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
"Why did President Trump make so many concessions?"
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
"I haven't made any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But negotiations on denuclearization are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not notice a "appropriate reaction" by the US to North Korean disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted that the United States still did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic attitude in his speech at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"He threatened us with war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the cessation of missile testing, aid in freeing hostages and bringing the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it is all a bit problematic," Mrs. Sumbun said.
Although Save the Children has a team to travel to Palo, it is not certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
In view of the constant shaking of the ground in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not something common on other parts of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palou, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best of times, travelling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A ship of hospitals anchored in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's decayed structure was the basis of President Joko Vidodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But Joko's state administration is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are held.
Joko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge scored a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeat in the Premier League game against Chelsea in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal score of 1-0 for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before kicking it against the opposite pole.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper edge of the net.
In the end, the ball ran away from Kepai Arrivabagya, who jumped towards her and entered the net.
"It was difficult to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kanté coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led at 1-0 in half after hitting the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning somewhere in the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense, and with his left leg, he hit the ball in the net on the opposite pole next to the goalie Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the state's disaster office said Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the ruins of buildings after an earthquake of 7.5 that felt Friday and caused waves of up to 6m high.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was initiated after a female body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
Police have called people from the area to call if they've seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in the beginning, but I would like to hear from everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and police have said that the procedure for informing the next of kin of the victim is under way.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back into his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants were now told that it would take several hours until they could return to their homes.
The officer allegedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
She keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked directly outside.
A large number of cops were standing inside the fenced area and overseeing the housing block.
Of all those who have any information, it is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, citing minutes 247 of 30 September.
The Statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument found in the middle of a debate on "the breakup of history"
His persecution would be a poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr Crick's attempt "stupid" and "I'm trying to break history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate currently taking place about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way the 19th century thinks and part of the history of a person that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more late 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressure.
Whether it is a fully credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worthy of honor and marking."
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man named only the name "Yuan" was found dead cut arteries and blood-covered near a stand at a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou announced the South China's Jutarnji List on Sunday.
The pig farmer was about to inoculate pigs on May 30th 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
Apparently, he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the next pig was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a 250-pound pig bit a farmer to death.
Evening news from Guiyang said a cousin called "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
Security camera footage shows Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje Novosti that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rarely the case, the attacks of pigs on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her wife on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kilogram - old pig nailed a Welsh farmer by the tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After eating a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
All they need is to show them respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floods in the area of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa blew at 05:00 Eastern time at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure area is created and moved towards the West Bank of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa approaches the Baia California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northward towards the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause strong precipitation in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, mudstorms and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of precipitation that will amount to about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above much of Arizona.
The floods are possible with a rapid deterioration in conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
There is no advice to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunder showers would bring local storm winds and dusty wind.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
There may be collapses in a quantity greater than 12 mm, which can cause less mud storms and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first fall in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings before Monday's end and Tuesday's coverage of the wider area.
The heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to an area where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched and will last all day on Wednesday.
Large temperature changes across the United States are possible in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the backlog of summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most central and eastern United States, it is expected to be warm in early October from 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high possibility of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks a tense testimony by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political hearing continued, and reporters interrupted a regular programme to announce the turnaround at the last minute Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Board that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state touching her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his zealous testimony that he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Friday's hearing was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching the content in the offices.
To give you a better impression, it's about an audience that's a lot like the one that watches American football or Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest audience with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC has taken second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There's a lot of interest left after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in a drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, they recorded the protesters shouting at him as he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee's hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood there with his eyes shot down while he was besieged by the demonstrators in front of CNN's cameras.
"I am standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to this land?"
They said to him: "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office issued a statement before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Committee was supposed to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidates next week, as required by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her exit plan from the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit in a second interview with her on the front page, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other's customs fees is "total nonsense".
Wade Sims' murder: police arrest Dytheon Simpson, suspected of the death of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of homicide, Baton Rouge police administration reported.
Officials released a video of a conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and reported they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, the CBS branch, reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported admitting that he shot Wade and killed him.
350,000 U.S. dollars bail was requested.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge announced on Friday a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the federal state police fugitives group Louisiana, the federal state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for implementing the law for "consisting and seeking the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
A player on a wing 183 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "desperate" and "shocked" over Wade's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano dumps ashes on Mexico City
The ash emitted by the volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans Saturday that they were not approaching the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash for 24 hours.
The center has followed multiple beatings and tremors.
Images on social media have shown thin layers of ash on windshield cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increased activity of volcanoes located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake of Magnitude struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalonian separatists clash against the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocated independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the protestors to mark the Catalan polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began throwing eggs and paint at the police, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights also broke out later during the day the police used batons to calm the fight.
Over the course of several hours, groups advocating independence have been chanting "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and against them the unionists shouted "Long Lived Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that seek independence did not subside for a year after the October 1st referendum declared illegal by Madrid, which the Catalonian separatists celebrate.
A large majority of voters opted for independence even though the turnout was low because those who opposed the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
The groups in favour of independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narcissus Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, although a close victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalonian independence parties are having a hard time holding a swing this year because their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict prompted politicians both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who announced to the investigative prison since the end of last year that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candiding for the European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after getting hit by a car in the house
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after being hit several times by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the front door and the building were damaged.
It's possible that at some point an arrow from the crossbow was fired on the car.
Menge's hit brought Livingstone victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0.
First goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston has won.
The new Scottish Premiership League Club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat since the 18th match at the head of the Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team lined up with Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in the premiership guests this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading league club with eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers within the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Livingstone, meanwhile, has increased his winnings to six games, and chief coach Holt still hasn't suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed a chance against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they hit that shot, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on his way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could just point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept a blow with Craig Halkett's head towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the guests
And that's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone came up with an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to assist Mengi who hit the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers were mostly in control of the ball, but faced a bulletproof domestic defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
It continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
The legs of goalie Rangers Allan McGregor got in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow took a big hit from another organised Livingstone attack.
The long additions failed to cross the Livingstone goal line, and they were not awarded two 11s – after Halkett's confrontation with replacement player Glen Middleton and one for hand-playing.
"Great" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and Livingstone score.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed expectations on that entry path.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to large clubs, but great credit goes to Holta and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in the lead of an excellently organized defense, and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worral take a breather during the entire game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set up with a good game under Gerrard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, they only opened a hole in the home team once, and it's kind of an invitation to pull on the Rangers in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany – aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They differed in their views on issues involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of presidential supporters came to see him.
And hundreds of protestors of Erdogan's opponent – a large number of Kurds – raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the division that some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others attack as an autocratic.
Road crash in Deptford: a cyclist fatally killed in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on the road with heavy traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the driver's escape from the Chiders Street accident, about a mile and a half from the Saturday crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Due to the accident, the roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and it is recommended that motor vehicles avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration reported that six police officers were injured in riots in a man's prison.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and continue.
Special "tornado" units have been brought in to contain riots involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were provided with assistance for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “A specially trained prison staff has been hired to solve the incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be committed to the police and that they can spend longer behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the intervention police were called to prison to address a serious situation in which staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (possible benefits for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen at the beginning of the following week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the Desert Southwest with the remaining force and carries the threat of floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings of floods Monday and Tuesday in the area of West Arizona, across South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday by the rain and cross it directly on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported in its tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones brought tropical storms or depression within a 200 - mile [120 km] radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre envisions 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm on the Arizona border.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rock and the Great Pool there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For those outside the threat of floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these precipitation could be beneficial because drought is currently taking place in the southwest.
"According to the American map of dry areas, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, second highest category," the weather.com reported.
The hurricane's journey first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm came upon the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, the coast of Mexico will be approached by a tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to floods.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from Baja California peninsula to Northwest Sonore ranges from 75 to 150 mm, up to a maximum of 250 mm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and South Utah by Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or her remains is the very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening floods and mudstorms in the deserts of the mountain ranges.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police administration reported that a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstock.
Police officers have called in everyone who has a recording of the event.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered the anger and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "took the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and firmly and emotionally dismissed the charges of Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at a hearing about the charges she filed.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's vote is to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in the public service," he told gathered supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of the Republican elections in half the presidential term.
"For five weeks, we are separated from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democratic mission was to "create resistance and obstruction".
A Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were dragged by huge waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when at dusk waves of up to six metres hit the coast, dragging many of them to their deaths and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami followed the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency for mitigating the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it carried cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami crossed the sea at an open speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palou.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent blows continued to shake that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In a statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two hundred-fold force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased tsunami power.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely disrupted and we do not have information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," says a Red Cross statement adding to it and staff and volunteers heading to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came at the moment the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the upper floor of a building panics people down on the street about the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused the blackout that caused the interruption of communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, she began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other necessities.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit evacuation centres in Palou on Saturday.
Tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala have successfully arrived in the city of Pal in which employees are placed in the Tarpaulin tents placed in their office yard, they have forwarded the destruction scenes on the road," Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great expertise have been prevented from arriving in Palo.
Under Indonesian rules, financing, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province's level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'OK, it is a national disaster' we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the next night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on the Pal, friends and families of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigated the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, the saviors freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragladers for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roe Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon remembered that after news of the demolition of the Roa Ro Hotel, which had spread to the Paraglider community, whatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray hook, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26,750 US dollars while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who filled an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, says a press release from the Newport police department.
In Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement, the car driver emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man came "in the race to Brink's employee behind his back" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses have noticed more suspects fleeing the scene, but police have not reported the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
On Saturday, on Twitter, he announced the change: “The living will be officially known as Kanye West. ”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used it as the title of its eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest show on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being a shortcut to his current artistic name, West earlier said the word had religious meaning for him.
"I believe that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”, West said earlier this year in a discussion about the title of his album with Radio Leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It started with Kanya, which means “only” in Ye itself – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, Jay-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a dash and a dash and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promised not to use the army against citizens
Mexican President Andres candidate Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people".
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in that square on October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people at the moment leftist student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young criminals.
The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the area of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it invests in research in the area," said an investor in artificial intelligence and an expert in the area of Kai Fu Leeu who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans on artificial intelligence, although the US in principle lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"A double increase in the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next major discovery in the area of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"A double increase in investment could double the chance that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US," Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee's book: "AI Power: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that beat Othello's best American player, and later he was the director of Microsoft's research department and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from the university to work on the research of artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctoral candidates in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation's Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science provides financial resources to people in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and Other State Organisations provides financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and that has blocked Greece's opening of accession negotiations with the European Union and NATO.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia and Greece that its northern neighbour's name represents her territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubts as to whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum voter list was, "How would you like to join NATO and the EU in accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying in order to allow Macedonia, one of the post-Yugoslav countries, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 13 hours.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined a referendum on the country's name in Strumica on 30 September 2018, which would pave the way for NATO's association with the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kvardarkov set up a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje and received chairs outside tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the elevated heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country in which the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the output must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it took office last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense to score a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, hitting the 65th minute.
Argentina's attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defense players and then made it to the open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then outrun several more on the edge of Brighton's space.
That's when he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English first-time attacker returned the ball to Aguerre who threw the right-hand ball into the right-hand side of the net and defeated doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulty with his foot," reported Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage at the Premier League meeting.
That shot was scored in 29 minutes.
During that game, Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's field.
He's done a wonderful job adding the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sanne pushed the ball a few times before leading Sterling to the statue.
Sky Blues' attacker threw the ball into the net just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City is fighting Hoffenheim in a group game of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the game, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes for Sunday's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National League of the West, get into play.
On Friday night the Rockies won 5 : 2 nationals at least secured a place in the wild-card game, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The nationals still have to announce a Sunday starter, but they're supposed to offer Scher a game in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher room on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-hand man from Washington achieved a score of 18:7, the average winning race (ERA) of 2.53, and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds shifts this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During the talks on the importance of the turnout of Republican voters in the general elections, the president wriggled to comment on Brett Kavanaugh's election as Supreme Court judge.
"Everything we have done will be tested in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
Their intention is to regain power in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, so they want power and control, and we won't give them.
Democrats, he says, have a mission "to resist and disturb".
"You have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt and lying".
He called Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee by name, causing loud public disapproval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document -- it was really bad body language, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
It does not tolerate the presentation of personal opinions
I wasn't too surprised when momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of representatives of the Labour Party who have been told that they are not welcome – and all because we have told us what is on our mind.
According to my associate Joan Ryan, they behaved similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The announcement of a meeting of the Labour Party's Nottingham East on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Labour Party meetings of the Main Council on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, there are many meetings going on in a different tone nowadays, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten if its fulfillment ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since the associates I thought we shared similar political opinions from me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and a position I would never otherwise agree with – whether it was a national security or an EU single market.
Whenever I address the public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – there is a flood of offensive words on social networks that call for my recall, who give up the centre's policies and tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I've been sent are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One aspect of this political era that has most disappointed me is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each proposal for non-trust or change of electoral rules we are becoming an increasingly narrow party.
Many times in the last two years, they've advised me to bend my head, not to be so loud and tell me that everything will be fine."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school multidisciplinary classroom to fail, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councilor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, nor in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing at Brexit, which will negatively affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electoral units, whether it's the members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political benefit will deter me from acting as I think it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heading for the summit
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennet's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the scale and the only ones unbeatable are ten teams.
After all, the ultimate defense and the better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tested at every game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: “Congratulations to Ayru, they took advantage of opportunities better than us. ”
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise results, and Jason Baggott took advantage of an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership by eleven years before, at the very halfway point, he scored and made an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr to 17:5 before the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt to realize Baggot reduced his advantage to five points.
Then came a long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott they took on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by trying to get Stafford McDowall to realize Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got the yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, and it was an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card to bring down the climate that didn't have the ball; with the line for the penalty shot, MacPherson pulled the laying behind Ayra in a full swing of the breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent a side player to Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
A Still Game star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to appear, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the "growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will assign her an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a naval center full of elevators in La Paz.
There's a flag of ocean color on the public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are winged: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring him back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in Chile's favor during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as is longing for the re-floating of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1st, following a five-year procedure, these hopes may be at the highest level in the past few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A multitude of Bolivians across the country will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the surrender of a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are almost back in the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearings, meaning that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting the interests of Bolivia, the last four years may have brought them back.
"The question of access to the sea has gained the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried every good will in Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at one point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the court's position that the court made an unusually quick decision.
Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "interrupt 139 years of disagreement with each other with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales -- still one of Latin American's favorite presidents -- used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up the rights of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said there would be no nuclear disarmament if it could not trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm nuclear if he couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
He made comments at a point where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says sanctions have continued due to "free imagination" and that the US's opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pyongjang taking concrete steps to disarm first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to give up the arsenal that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of large head coverings is on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely cover the sun, do not look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion track presented a line of crazy huge head coverings for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and delighted the fans of style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have been disrupted by Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention to the runway.
The example highlighted was made by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide quilt-like quilt that has completely taken over the model's heads.
The other globular accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these supplements were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-end pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a big fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats perfectly fit the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a rim about 60 cm wide, which has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind an extremely impractical hat that conquered social networks on the fashion runway sent another great creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
The extinguished orange Rafia bag, decorated with rivets of Rafia and white leather lunch, was an exhibition copy in the summer collection Jacques' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
A stylist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told Faceae: “I expect large hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The Language Skills the People of the World Need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results of exams, with additional weight given by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are working to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of school selection.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the most language reviews were made by independent school students.
A total of 68% of foreign language students received excellent grades.
The data collected at 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent rating in Mandarin, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today languages are considered as electoral subjects as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more imperative in preparing young people for careers.
Because more and more jobs require language knowledge, these skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, those who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will experience the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with foreigners, which gives him an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 % of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know the language well enough to communicate on it, and France is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, 15 % more.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will choose languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools he will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professional in the area.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which students can prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future holds.
There can be no disregard for the fact that today's global language business is very important for the future of each country so that it must also reflect on education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools
LeBron will play Lakers' first tracksuit in San Diego on Sunday
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Laker's coach Luke Walton announced James will play in the first pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But there's no telling how many minutes it'll take.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers official page.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers pre-season, which consists of six games.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign at numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned events that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does Trump's West Virginia rally start tonight, and how can you look at him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time, tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's event in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, which sparked controversy over the charges of sexual abuse, and the Senate's confirmation decision has been pending for a week until the FBI investigation is completed.
But the primary goal of this series of events is to help Republicans achieve the advantage for the November elections.
Therefore, from Trump's presidential campaign headquarters, five meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Most of the Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the turbulent campaign," Reuters an anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign said.
Tonight's Wesbanco Arena event in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month. In 2016, Trump won more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the ranking in the polls," said political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team leaves heart in the field before Sunday's individual fights
After three one-sided sessions, a couple's fight Sunday afternoon might be exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to turn.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a saying that is particularly true in sports and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the wheel of happiness now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are ahead with four points, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouraged by his paired game with Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points after a whole day's game.
Spieth played deadly from thee to the green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading cheers were getting louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spieth came to an unsolvable outcome.
After the road he won the 15-hole game, there was a similar cheerleading roar in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can reverse everything.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for those players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
A European strange but irresistible couple has a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari show that it is those players who are to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than these two who can seal the victory of Europeans as the sun sets over Paris' Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both win at the same time on different holes.
Yet, it is too soon to speak about the Europeans ’ victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noreen and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One bogey and two double bogeys at the first nine holes in the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole they couldn't dig from.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch games of couples closely because you can see the interactions of players in pairs, hear the tips that give and those that don't give, as well as study the strategy that can change in a moment.
Europeans have so far played better as a team, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary combat, which some, especially Stateside, have suspected.
Europeans in the last day Ryder Cup enters with guidance from 10:6
Europeans come in with a significant advantage over the United States from 10:6 on Saturday in pairs on the last day of Ryder Cup .
The dynamic duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods brought four points of difference to Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy she missed in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs with a score of 3:1 .
The American team has shown more fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk teams need to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debutant from the European team to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, known as "Mollywood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points in the game in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they proved themselves superior in the game against Woods and US debutante Bryson Dechambeau with a 5-4 victory.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games made some brilliant moves, but now he has 19 defeats from 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose took a break from the morning fourballs to get back in the game with his partner, Henrik Stanson, and suffered a 2–1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans did not do everything as smooth as the south-east of Paris during a pleasant day.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points Sunday and set the scale high for their American team.
First they defeated Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2–1 in fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with 4–3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of Ryder Cup the team that was behind four points managed to return to individual games, although Fury's team only needed an unresolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days behind schedule, it seems Sunday's counterattack will be difficult for them to fall.
North Korea announced that there is no "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill last year", for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, from the United States we have not received a satisfactory response," he added.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we have no faith in our national security. Under such circumstances there is no way that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's "progressive" approach to denuclearisation that would gradually abolish sanctions in North Korea, his statement is significant because it has not rejected unilateral denuclearisation as it has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim made a promise to work on "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States conditioned that Pyongyang give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on denuclearisation before that and increases the pressure with sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war", added Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is only a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri didn't mention if there were any plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump that the president of the United States was talking about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister noted that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae had held as many as three meetings in the last five months and added, "If denuclearisation had been sought by South Korea and not the US, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt."
Regardless, the tone of Minister Rio's speech differed greatly from that of last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that targeting continental US missiles was inevitable after Evil President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that they still have a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea carries out denuclearisation.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have voiced their view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "Implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until full, final and verified denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding the nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
He met with Rio at the UN main assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea set up a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" related to the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course in which they learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night's sleep in an effort to fight against an increasingly widespread culture of learning along with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of the course came after he gave a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find this out just now, in my senior year of college? ”
She said no one told her how important the dream is, which surprised me," The Telegraph told SETimes.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
The professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the Paul Barreira Health Service said the University decided to introduce a course after serious sleep deprivation was observed in students during the week.
A one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a dormitory where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to find out the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects success, and how important sleep routines are.
During the course, students also learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Cheisler.
A culture of pride for all-night learning before exams still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleep also helps in combating obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student in chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler come up with a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend his course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by display electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1: 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's hit wiped out Steven Gerrard's missing defense and ended the game by winning Livingstone with a score of 1:0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first victory in the feast after the triumph in February and the result 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team is now behind eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and didn't seem to even the score.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingstone climbed to third place with only one event of difference behind the Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after a line judge named Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight alterations on his hips and so huddled beside Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same figure of Livingstone that the Hearts took action last week and would be delighted that his well-designed figure choked every attempt by an opponent.
The Rangers may have had more ball in their possession, but Livingstone made more with it.
They had a chance to score for two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game, which opened up space for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the prisoner missed the opportunity.
Captain Craig Halkett intercepted Keaghan Jacobs' deep free blow, but his defense teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise blow to the rear.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have sentenced him to 11 minutes after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not respect the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers were able to point only two balls at the goal, but the former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly had one blow to Lassane Coulibaly's head and the pitomial blow of Ovie Ejaria was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute game of Livingstone slowed down the game, no one can deny it.
The Rangers missed using Jacobs' deep return ball again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his cool and chose Menga for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an immediate effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingstone continued to draw visitors into exactly the same game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long blow after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively shut Jacobs down before Lithgow made a broad run from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again asked for an 11-year-old because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes this time.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter · Global Voices
And now here's a page from our Almanac on "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the birth date of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger’s counter has also become the main stronghold of pop culture, for example in the 1950 Bells of Colorado, where the main roles were seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radiation in minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system that it recognizes bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes removal of immune system cells from the patient and their alteration to the laboratory
The cells are being treated so that they can "recogniz" protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject into the patient
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune system cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “recognizable” protein called HER2 which is common to many cancers and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune system cells from the patient and their “learning” to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after visiting the Saturday Night Live show, engaged in discussions about Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the title "Make America Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was surveyed during the Saturday Night Live show following a breakup in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president 2020.
After performing the third song of a night called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the title "Make America Big Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the recording of West's speech on social media was transmitted by a comedian named Chris Rock.
You don't know if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
Also, West complained to the audience that behind the stage, he was being overturned for the hat he was wearing.
"They harassed me behind the stage.
They told me: “Don’t go anywhere with that hat. ”
I've been bullied!
They said I sank," says Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the bottom?” and said he would wear his Superman cloak because that means I can’t tell him what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try with love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused the public’s dissatisfaction at least twice, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person said for the magazine: “The whole studio was silent. ”
West was called at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
West performed the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, amazed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia."
But the director of Karen Hunter's Twitter show announced that West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, a rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially known under the name of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, which is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late musical legend Prince changed her name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.

Star Series Game of Thrones Kit Harrington Pointed to Toxic Virility
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-wrestler in HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the Game of Thrones.
But a 31-year-old actor turned to a stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of such TV roles, boys often feel that they have to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague of Rose Leslie from the Game of Thrones series, admitted he wanted to face this problem "very decisively".
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What did we teach men as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that TV, thanks to very masculine characters on screens, could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born and what has been learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel that they have to have these particular lines of man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not record the sequel to the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer and said that he "completed with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will be performing a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that had happened to him during the shooting of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife by filming that show, which gave me a family and a future life," he discovered.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in a fantastic series that won the Emmy Award.
A couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/SIDA: China reports a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China announced that 14% had increased the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted across parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
Every year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a major one.
Studies estimate that 70 - 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to face this problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has given up data on the GOP senators, calling it "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Attorney Maxine Walters denied Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal data from three Republican US senators on Wikipedia's website.
A democratic representative from Los Angeles assures that these claims are spread by individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as by websites.
"Lesses, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information on the network appeared on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
A conservative website such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address revealing the source of the data belonged to the Waters office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, reported The Hill.
"These baseless allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
‘A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is not at all responsible for leaking those data.
These unsubstantiated allegations are totally wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's been accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and stable."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticisms the Democrats were giving to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing in the general elections against Waters, also tweeted.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed "major authorities and law enforcement authorities" about these false allegations.
"We will make sure that perpetrators are discovered and that they suffer legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Again on assignment" – not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights spies
It is now common in every new British film to search for messages about Brexit, and it seems that this is also the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel is called "Johnny English" for the first time in 2003 and returned to the big screen titled "Johnny English Rides Again".
Will the twisted own satire of how clearly worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English with his eyes and rubber face again has permission to complicate the situation, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a freaky secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to the "reduced" glamour, reminds Inspector Clouseau, has a breath of character Mr. Bean and somewhat reminds him of the guy who sang a note of the opening of the opening of the London Olympic Games 2012.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and what is the image of chaos.
There are one or two convenient moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Inconceivable Mission" themselves offer elements of comedy.
In my opinion, Johnny English's freaky stories are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent gags embodyed in Mr. Bean's image.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a generally accepted fact.
The hacker entered the most secret British spy web and discovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, who, unfortunately, briefly appeared as Kevin Eldon.
It filled a glass of the Prime Minister's patience, the arrogant and belligerent character who's experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to show the character who should represent Theresa May faithfully, but she didn't exactly get the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as director of a fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome gogos here because English teaches to spy in rocking style.
English quickly leads to the government's emergency meeting, where it meets Bough again, its former partner and its eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander, played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletova, embodyed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the vicious Jason Volta being played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous experiences: disguised as waiters of the incandescent French restaurant, they cause a huge mess by smuggling into Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes a complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything has been done properly for this last sequel, but however attractive and flimsy the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
It's quite a mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English movies, I asked myself again, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
Labour Party denies working out a plan for the British to work four days a week, and they get paid in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the company's employees' bosses to pass on savings made by the AI revolution and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "be integrated" into the party's economic programme and plans to favour the interests of workers.
The union congress has supported the shift to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it is an effort that fits into the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this trend.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the hands of "personal directors" and "profit" in municipal companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their overall role because the Labour government could make "declarations" on the basis of the irregularities noted.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in management boards of companies and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10% of private company capital would be given to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and questions whether the conclusion of the agency could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility that the FBI would discover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said going to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after these statements were made, and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, unwavering, unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should be strongly accused of changing that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett firmly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything's changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything on poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay VIP tickets), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, emailing to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful means of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people free concerts the right way to convince people to call for action, or just another case of so-called "clictivism" – where people feel that signing an internet petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have sought to achieve a number of different goals.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive to world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and contractors in the United Kingdom that advocates "helping children to develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda with the aim of ending malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Foundation "The Power of Nutrition", an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the most common questions on its website, which reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult journey . . . someday we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, as have great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances by Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the performances at this year's New York event to be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke announced, according to weekly Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's engagement in Syria is particularly where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that Russia in the Middle East is the reason that it wants to sell energy in the area as it is in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
But in his view, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those present at the event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which is presented in the US as "a voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, stressing that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, and for Russia, he says it "uses the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as Trump's administration's intention to increase its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply fuelled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says federal senator Massachusetts
Federal Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of running herself.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which implies a woman at the head," The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying he is "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet she tweeted Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a study by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in the 2020 potential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of family violence that occurred Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, is comparable to other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are returning to," Donald Trump told the audience at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that is silent about both her son and other war veterans said that "they are returning a little differently, returning hardened, returning wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholized state, says Dan Bennett, spokesman for the City of Vasili.
18 federal states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that reduces asylum to victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the county submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support a asylum-seeking policy challenger, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the US Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but US officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which comes a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and family violence problems.
A new asylum policy in the United States changed the immigration committee's 2014 decision allowing immigrants without documents to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County's state attorney, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such a obstacle violates that principle," a report by a friend of the court said.
Lawyers further argued that policies that reduce the entry of immigrants harm the American economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "guarantee the necessary labour".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"A asylum is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June's policy.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems even all the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palou as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palou.
‘Emergency vehicles every minute of import of the body.
The government of the needy is pure water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, reading through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were crammed.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the open because of continued severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was depressed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "mistreatment" by means of "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long ad in the US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a paid addition to the China Daily newspaper in Iowa's most-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6th congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials in a Reuters statement described as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliations at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, China's main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing has harmed US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "is now doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what the paper was about.
Kavanaugh's debacle distanced voters from mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans stand by Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were very excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, said for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher voiced suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon)'s last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, quoted a newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang: “The Novembers are coming! ” as Republicans who control the Judicial Committee prepared to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond expectations," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say they are already on a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among women in suburban and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that there might be a negative reaction if Republicans continue with confirmation.
"It is a real mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about the way the Republicans approached it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, said to news.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined towards him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in the truthfulness of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they trust Kavanaugh safely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations Ford made, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for download of Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee Open Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal network storage" or PO.
It may contain contact lists, obligation lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision on who can access which information fully to users.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help keep Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project contract, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to make their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not it will bring about a complete change in which all their business models would turn completely overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media release Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptova "is a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the First World War Priest Victoria Cross · Global Voices
Celebration in honor of the only priest of the Church of England awarded with the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the September 29th 1918 award in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he had received that recognition.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across St. Quentin's channel “through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the battlefield and machine guns. ”
Later, he rushed to the front lines and led the squad forward with "amazing courage" before chasing the Polish cannon without anyone's help and maiming three of his troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve, and it stimulates humility. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Peppu
Imagine this staying up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches in order to eventually disable you from monitoring the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the United Kingdom they appeared live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in the UK remained in shock when the transmission was interrupted by Piglet Peppa.
Many were not at all impressed by the fact that they remained awake until the early hours of the morning because of the struggle.
One fan described the interruption of transmission to children's cartoons on Twitter as "a sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication to Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Yuppie, "Peppa Pig."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from Great Britain in the future.
"When I consider replaying, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But the transmission is there at six o'clock Sunday morning and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't.
I can promise you that next time it won't come to that.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which is what we're going to do, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
A twenty-four-year-old said that until he left for high school he was not aware that "they are not all like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics was less important to him since he became a father.
A regular longtime show host, Kirsty Young, took a few months off from her illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt "less valuable" during his childhood than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others have been the real things that have given me power and strength to succeed. ”
He says he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates for LGBT and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy to live openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you are so young you go through so much," he looked back at his first Olympic games when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later. He said it was hard to find someone the same age and experienced similar ups and downs.
In June they became parents of a son whose name was Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than golden Olympic medals.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was did they get tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing out, and only after he stopped breathing and died did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I only knew that what I had dreamed of all my life to jump in front of a local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the selection of the first song " Proud" by Heather Small who reverberated in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games and on which she always urchins .

Mickelson out of shape on the bench on Ryder's Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to take full shape to avoid an awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who played the record 12th time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and developing his game at the gym in the hope of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding terrain of Le Golf National, where a long uneven terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the terrain itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is facing the precision British Open Francescom Molinari champion, who won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man more than he could say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence has brought certain intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Danac debuted in the Valderrama match in 1997, where Captain Sevé Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage over Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a close contrast to 141⁄2 .
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a close difference," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the team 2018.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full strength tomorrow.
Get out on the field and do it right.
Nothing's over until the floor's on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's what remains of the focus.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who is standing in front of us, the biggest players in the world."
Thrilled by the performance of his players on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of an ore in this.
Tomorrow it's time to face a different beast.
The main individual performances tomorrow are something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, they're on the final exam of your golfer skills.
It's a message you have to convey to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to give their best.
Now leave your teammate because he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those big turns on the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up being a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question that Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that rush starts in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our show and placed the boys as if, you know, we were going to try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and facing Rory McIllroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship put back on hold
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be launched in 2014 to replace the old warships from the cold war, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The release into service of the ship Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the brand new frigates of Baden-Wuertemberg class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit citing the military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, ordered by the Navy as early as 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, it will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships that are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its power abroad will already become obsolete by the time of entry into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would make a warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because Baden-Wuertemberg ships will be operated by crew of about 120 sailors half less than on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is dramatically too heavy to reduce its efficiency and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project including crew training is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is actually "out of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as old ships have been put out of service and there have been no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation eavesdrops on the secret life of a bat
New research carried out on the Scotland Heights property aims to discover that bats use the landscape to hunt food.
It is hoped that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-smelling and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what species does.
Then a map of the habitat and report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation consultant, hopes to find out what habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects shelters and habitat losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to prey capture.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats inhabit Scotland live.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there is much more that we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us to understand better what they need to progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before the start of maintenance work inside buildings, since unintentional destruction of a single bed can kill up to 400 females and young people, likely destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it's illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative for the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their population is progressing. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges brought against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which issued those charges.
An attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently that's when he paid her $375 000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video that he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the indictment was filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," says a five-time gold ball winner in a camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is fine," the football player added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns," Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said a footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years".
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in a hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the football room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99%" is a "good guy" betrayed by that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that he had an agreement.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and that she was photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she "was afraid of retaliation" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
A thirty-four-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she is still traumatised by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing into Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro crossing.
Brexit: UK Will "Repent Forever" for Losing Car Manufacturers · Global Voices
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of waiting at the border in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cause job losses.
Burnaston's plant, manufactured by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my view that if Britain leaves the EU in late March without an agreement, we will experience production delays in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have voiced fears of leaving the EU without an agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Minii factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer relates to the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the principle "right on time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars that are ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at the border industry says could lead to delays and shortages.
Toyota at its Derbyshire factory could not hold more supplies than needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, I say, not only the maintenance of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 told today's programme.
"The evidence not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful supply chain."
In Toyota, they could not tell how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the union of the Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after those jobs have gone, they never return.”
The government spokesman says, "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight over Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and any obstruction of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire the deputy state attorney and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, has been spreading gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid overlap with the Senate Judicial Board hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's lawsuit against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would argue: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences is not a consequence of the aversion to "theatral behavior" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are spreading."
She then suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organises more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have analysed the figures."
Brief speeches will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it possible often, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and it is precisely that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled press.
EU Health Minister writes to workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The minister of health sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to offset the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
However, the United Kingdom government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
A line player from the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury on Saturday's defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a score of 31–27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the stretcher and sent it for further searches.
A representative of Tennessee State State State University told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had stepped out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no "detail of the type/range of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of play experience, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday he had a total of five downs before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 downhills in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee in the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee in the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
That step will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that a higher fee will be charged to foreign customers in the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to secure more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high salaries.
An increase in the fee will be charged by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee to be collected for the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issuing may be up to three per cent.
The treasury expects the move to raise 120m pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become “spirit cities” especially in the capital city because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the fee to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not using the country, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on price-effective properties to fix "the shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the end of nothing-provoked deployments.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to renewing the British dream that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end-of-the-line ambition" is one day to become head of Scotland.
Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently ranks third in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer, he moved to the Light Stadium after re-run St. Mirren at the Scottish football championship last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, this opportunity could only be realized if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's post include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former Allo's boss, Athletica, says he didn't feel scared because he inherited such famous names in such a big club, after previously refusing calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross is only finishing the third year of his management career, after the period during which he was assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and led St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the winner of the title champion next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," Alloe recalled.
"I really believed management was what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I've done well, made good money and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on Saturday, according to research
The summer heat wave increased the income of British pubs struggling with finance, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars achieved an increase in July's income by 2.7 per cent, but income in restaurants was reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the fine weather and the participation of England in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues grew 2.8 percent, with restaurants being even more affected.
A 1.8 percent drop in the income of the restaurant in June only deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are used mostly have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mainly served also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, and food sales fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for vacation and catering, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events are still the greatest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to cope with difficulties, although the decline in sales of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food business owners, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the share of brands.

One in five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
News has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, opens secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
The survey, which included 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instas" accounts reference to the web location for the sharing of photos.
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they were using a cleaned "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to say "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), showed that 40% of students aged 11-18 have two profiles, half of whom recognise that they own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice of athlete" on the Scottish Athletic Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as the ineligible director of the annual Governing Body Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run sports to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a 200-400-metre race at the 1996 game in Atlanta, out of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a passing ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today he is practicing agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the Internet on the advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
A company for the production of traitors with its advertising that compares mothers who suckle their children with cows that are aroused by the husband is divided opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of products that are said to be "the first silent bearer of the world," Elvie for Consumer Technology published an advertisement inspired by ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music saying, "Yes, I'm makin' myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not the name, it's my breasts."
Then comes the chorus: “Push out, pump up, feed the baby with it, pump out, pump up, milk my ladies. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "disgusting" milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another comments: “Absolutely traumatic for a mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A totally lame commercial."
Others defended advertising, with one woman admitting that her song was "stupid".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Betraying milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers who produce milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like a ‘cow’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced all with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor, however, is completely silent, there are no wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-fed bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie's traitor is so revolutionary a product that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put betrayal and all its challenges at the centre of attention, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor would bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's traitor made it to the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be placed under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were documentless immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
Risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before a congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors without an escort.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested earlier had not been recorded in criminal records.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the home of sponsors in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we continue our search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
According to shelter workers, with a view to speeding up the process for children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear through a videoconference call, not personally, to present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely it is to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good - bye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would "conform to that and deal with them".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" from terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western lands" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel stronghold created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Accord has prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with Russia's support on the province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the commission should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, the recall and the scandal end his presidency too soon.
What would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of a viewer's fatigue right now.
Since 2014, the outlook in the shock period has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of impact, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed the audience with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the evenings of broadcasting the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designed Survival" drama, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, “Because it makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's an amusing value to chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on abortion originating from the Roe proceedings against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite with the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you realize that for the sixth hour you have been watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used deep background sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's clothing jacket worth $15,000 (“a garment full of arrogance, ” writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, of Mr Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"A part of what he makes you think of him as a reality show is that he feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "The pawnshop", about the rotating cast and the daily complications of Trump's show (combating with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to fall behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he was in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai at a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by the end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside pours into the most uncertain mid-term congressional election race
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the remodeling of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the same race.
This recently reorganized suburban district of Pittsburgh points out a Democrat named Conor Lamb last spring who won a seat in the second district in special elections.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-painted after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally framed in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a fight to finance a campaign between the main party fundraisers, the Committee raising funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a widely monitored special March election for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The United States weighs on whether El Salvador should be punished for providing support to China and then withdraw.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the management team of Trump's organization.
State Department officials have decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "a recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Middle American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to continue at a similar gathering last year, which was considered to be an improvement in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and had actually suspended any consideration of the punishments for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on an anonymous basis.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing you know, it could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which is now subject to very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is preparing to step forward again before the voters and perhaps eventually with the jury of his peers.
There are a lot of silences "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trum's inevitable fall -- or those similar to him in Europe -- is inevitable.
All of us must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only that the West stood up to him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or late.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflation.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since these newspapers reported that he secretly proposed recording the president last year and speculated on his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How are we going to respond if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he has been confirmed for the Supreme Court despite convincing charges of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will call Mr Trump to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're gonna fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with the cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapidu from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify as a member of the G Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the beltman Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use the score as a jumping board for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
"We came into the game believing that we could achieve something and we pulled the point.
We may have been able to steal the game in the end, but, in general, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday's another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The boys are good and the boys are really enjoying themselves; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the costs of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start the conversation," said Holly Snyder, the Vice President of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you to come up with a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Take care of your legal documents: Prevent legal battles from taking root.
Engage healthcare professionals to identify a reliable person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to select a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at your fingertips."
A man shot several times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home after nightfall.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials reported, and an increase in deaths is expected.
Since communications were interrupted, aid workers could not obtain any information from the province of Dongala, an area north of Palu, closer to the 7.5 - degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palou after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches more than 300 km along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggal.
The nickel mines are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Moravaly, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit with tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh at the northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the town of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018.: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of family violence and resisting arrest, a report published Saturday by a state policeman in Alaska said.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the question of the plea of guilt was declared "innocent, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A violations, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of family violence and possession of alcoholized weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and in the coming days an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There's videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palou when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people who have not been sentenced to federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to attack a bicycle path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted severe bodily injury, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, which was imposed in the southern district of New York.
Both points lead to a possible death penalty, in accordance with a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal grand jury hit a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of murder and extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnic,” said in a notice of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last tried a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York, 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence.
A conservative member of parliament says that Nigel Farage should be in charge of the talks on Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a demonstration at a conservative conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptic because one member of Parliament Theresa May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone told the Birmingham rallies that the United Kingdom would "come out" so far that Mr Farage was Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is stressed by the Torys who are leaning away from the remains that are joining a special protest against Brexito in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of the attack on supporters of Brexit, supporters of the remnant and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihull that he wanted to "refuse Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been given the title and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel the Chequers."
Voicing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
The conservative and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also in the procession, addressing the press with the words: “I am just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a note to Mrs May, she added: "Premiers retain their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the group that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the question of trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it won't work out for you."
In an enthusiastic message to the audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of being betrayed by Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Many activists waved "Toryevci v. Brexit" banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus" plan, for an uninterrupted state at the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports a Democrat from Massachusetts was talking about her future on Saturday at a close association with citizens in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's been at the centre of speculation for some time now so she can stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Hollyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which implies a woman in charge."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death toll of basketball players at Louisiana State University (LSU) Wayne Sims who happened Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20th), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they posted a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early on Friday near the campus of the University of Southern.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and possessing weapons and killing Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student 198 cm tall who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches in 10 first plays last season and an average of 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after order guarantees him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a major role in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to enter the market at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel on the wheel, for which Ferrari driver reluctantly left the free interior in danger of lagging behind after a double move in defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was seven by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while relying on his tires to reach a fast finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally got into the boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day since Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he's a gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve a formational finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad speech from the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a meeting Saturday for insisting that she had not released a letter to the public from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate had proved that people were "evil and nasty and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - 'ah, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had arrived from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release her story to the public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for."
However, her denial was not met with the approval of the president, who commented at the Saturday evening meeting: “Let me tell you something — it was a very bad speech of the body.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see evil, disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the president said, Mediaite reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 λ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a victory in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5 . 3.
In the early minutes, the Giants took advantage of two shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equations, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard evened for Dundee before two of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's goals ensured victory.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Elite League for the team of Adam Keefe, who came from the background and beat Dundee with the result of 2        . 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening of the game arrived in the fourth minute, at 3:35 sharp, with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the leadership by hitting Beauvilleer four minutes later.
In the early opening of the game, Sullivan's home team returned to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt made it possible for Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished their first third lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals regrouped, and Bouchard once again brought them to an equalization in measuring the forces naked at 2737.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team was already halfway through the last third of the game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five matches, host the Milton Keynes team in the next match Friday.
The air traffic controller is dying to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died as he ensured the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many have disappeared as if after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Heavy earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the airport control tower of Mutiara Sis Al-Yufri, which was rocking hard.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart is breaking because of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says there is limited access to the cities of Dongali, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to increase, as many bodies are still under ruins and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, agency spokesman.
The waves that reached a height of up to six meters destroyed Pala, where a mass burial would take place Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove an ambulance every minute of import of the body.
The government is running low on clean water.
There's little shops robbing everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is driven as missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
An airline that owns an airplane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being driven as missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said they cannot trace one of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in a hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane flew very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water that was cutting through their waists to the exit in case of a plane that was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair the docks also helped rescue using a boat to blow people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, but that none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a time check on the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up a case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of incinerating a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said the location information was obtained from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous allegations, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "he lied because his truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is an enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The singing group "The High Breed" from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and hip-hop make it popular again.
Artists like Fuguees and Commons are reborn in Great Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "another black woman".
A couple deny being racist, comparing the charge with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEE ONE MORE BLACK WOMAN," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a note to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "disadvantaged" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice because, she claims, their former nanny, who was an African American, was doing her job badly, and that she was expecting the Philippines instead of her, she was transmitting the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and seeking damages of $350 a day for a period of six months for which she was originally engaged, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple objected to claims that racists, saying that ending Maurice's employment was reasonable to do because of the fear that they would not be able to trust her later on because of the insult.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife only received two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and was in "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly sentenced a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It’s hard before publication to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very funny what we now know about Paddington's enormous success."
Said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't a braggart," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything happened as some achievement of your own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was observed that way.
Though it was his work and his imagination, he always credited the credit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Hope regularly called to say that it is really bad and that they believe it will not get away," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say good-bye to her.
Which I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications her doctors gave her to maintain her heart function slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died just before she boarded, and then it all went out.
All I had to do was sit there and wait and know what was gonna happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in mourning at the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers -- who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge with a view to preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with an infectious smile waiting for a bright career.
"They all remembered him by his smile.
They always said his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before he died, however, he left his job because he was in “a really dark state. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found a brother after this one took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have a negative effect. ”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards "so that people would know that there's someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence you have to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He was at the very bottom of Christmas when the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye, he didn't want anything else."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “All of this leaves a big hole in the family.
He's ripping us off.
But we'll keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI launches its investigation.
"I thought we might bring a little unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for in a time and scope limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "disintegrating" in the middle of an ingrained party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was prompted by a choice of moments.
The midterm elections arrive in just five weeks, on November 6th if, what is expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the election for the country's highest court.
George W. Bush constantly invites the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break the vote and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea 'fall' led by Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Referring to data from the U.S. ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 refugees last year compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are stricter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more charges that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't make a public comment.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South that are still technical in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed more broadly to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed the US sanctions for failing to make any progress since.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not possible to disarm ourselves under such circumstances first," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric", says he is incapable of service at the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Judge Brett Kavanaugh "histically" and said he was incapable of service in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman, if she ever did so, would be called 'hysteric'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Board on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated defamation" organised by the Liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if he would try to call Kavanaugh off if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi stepped down.
"I will say the following if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that she is concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh's decisions against the Act on Accessive Care or the Law on the Adoption of the Originator of the Roe v Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would reconsider any Supreme Court rulings.
"It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say 'isn't it wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticisms, anger that has been gathering for months and years can't be gotten rid of without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the executive director and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed the technique that, when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said: ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated me, is that, once I cried for unspeakable anger, an elderly woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they'll think you've been hit."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them Snow White and seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had already gone further, it was lagging behind in fundraising, and it vowed not to enter the race unless it collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave men $1,000, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of the people who supported her, by the frustration of the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and by the anger of sexism that her throat was tightened.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalled the media's reaction to it.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the US and China has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, US president, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new customs that have affected $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has fought back in some way each time, and recently, customs have been introduced from five to ten percent on $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised that the US will respond with a blow, and the world's second largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by making demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, US trade war pressures can provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for triggering economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a science co-co-operating for strategic thinking, who focused on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 .5 in the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole of pair 3, sent the ball into the water at the first strike, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been shaving in all rounds and has become one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started this format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was expelled by Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team, with 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became a European with the most winning tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop tears.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
It's all about the team, I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said, full of emotion after a European victory.
He relays the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won Sunday's legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2–1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rachm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now he's got a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistics of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 headlines, are right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend fighting to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were playing top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have given Europe resistance.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
