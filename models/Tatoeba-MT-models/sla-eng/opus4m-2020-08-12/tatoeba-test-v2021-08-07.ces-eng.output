According to the Tatoeby Directives, members are encouraged to add sentences in their native language or to translate them from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose words that sound naturally in their native language. When we write in languages other than native, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate the sentence only when you know for sure what it means.

I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to ask for a receipt.
I forgot my pen at home.
I forgot my wallet on the bedside table.
I forgot my password.
I forgot to pick Tom up from the airport.
I forgot Tom can read French.
I forgot to turn it off.
He forgot his briefcase at home.
He forgot to return the keys.
He'd sell his soul to the devil.
First of all, I'm without a crown, second of all, I don't have time.

The principles neutralize the acids.
I'm the last one to know the truth.
I lost in chess again.
You're lying again.
You're back to your old ways, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talking.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We're asleep.
My heart stopped.
Will someone stop human trafficking?
He shot himself for his unfortunate love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot you both.
They dragged her into the basement and raped her.
While I was reading, the phone rang.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already awake.
You can stay with me for now.
Don't disturb anything yet.
Did the police arrest him?
Did you arrest Tom?
Shut your fist.
I don't get paid for this.
I'm not paying for this.
This is what Tom's gonna punish you for.
I can't do it for Tom's actions.
You're not responsible for Tom's death.
For Tom's mistakes, an entire group was punished.
I love you for that.
I'm not getting paid for this.
In three months Tom was already dead.
They paid me $5 for the bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back later.
I'll call you back later.
He'll call back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, okay?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call an ambulance!
They locked Tom in the basement so he couldn't escape.
I closed the door so they wouldn't hear us.
I closed all six windows.
Close your book.
Please close the door on the way out.
Shut the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We'll sing another song.
I rang the bell, and I waited.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She loved him.
I love the ocean.
I love you.
The arms industry brings profits, but also suffering.
We have the rest of the day to ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What's butter made of?
I totally don't agree to be treated like this.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.
She seemed to be quiet.
I thought I was fighting a war.
I thought I was having sex with a beautiful girl.
I thought I'd changed my job.
I was dreaming about the onion.
I was dreaming about a friend of my workmate's.
I had a dream about Tatoeb.
I had a dream about this day.
I had a dream about Tom getting up from the dead.

Tom didn't seem to notice Mary was there.
Tom seemed to have everything he needed.
Tom didn't seem to understand any of what you said to him.
Tom didn't seem to be alone.
He seems very sleepy.
I think Tom's responsible for Mary's nervous breakdown.
It seems too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night.
Looks like spring's coming very soon.
Looks like I'm still sleepy during the day, but it looks like I can't sleep at all at night.
Looks like I did all this for nothing.
Looks like you're happy with yourself.
You seem to have the same problem as me.
I don't think anyone understands me.
I don't think anyone understands me.
You don't seem to be taking me seriously.
Looks like he saved a lot of money.
No one seems to have noticed anything.
Looks like the war's not over yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do this.

Tom seems to have less and less confidence in him.
Looks like Tom doesn't care if it happens or not.
Looks like Tom's telling the truth.
Looks like Tom doesn't remember any of us.
Looks like Tom's asleep.
Tom seems to have lost his purpose in life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
He seems to be losing his motivation.
Here's a picture of my school.
Here we need to use the clutch.
We left home early this morning.
I'm afraid to take a bite of this subject with her.
I'm reluctant to ask Tom for help.
Healthy relationships develop slowly.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
He's keeping her from work.

He asked if he'd come.
Let's ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
Ask your mother.
He made a noise, so everyone heard it right.
Turn up the radio a little bit.
He got old, he got lazy, and he got divorced, but he also got rich, and he became famous.
He tried his best to stop thinking about her.
I didn't like him from the beginning.
Turn it off, please.
Get lost!
She's gone.
We live alone.
We've been living in this town since 1960.
Do you like living here?

Try not to take so much.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try to explain it to Tom.
Try it again.

Disappeared in the crowd.
It's gone off the surface of the Earth.
Get out of here!
They crushed it.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Knowledge of oneself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.

I'll read it again.
It was snowing from the sky with rain.
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at.
They messed it up.
They sing in the congregation.
She was singing a song, smiling at me.
I wasn't attracted to her at first.
There's a cat under the desk.
Two boys came out of the room.
The news of Tom's death made me sad.
I've caused him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me, I'm disappointed.
The mature apple fell from the tree.
I'm hurt.
It's a mirror. It's a mirror.
The mirror is cloudy.
The mirror broke.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he got home.
They ruined my life.
I'd cancel all the slaughterhouses if I could.
You cancelled the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
She pink-faced her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from that book.
You're getting fat.
I wouldn't make fun of that.

I took part in the debate.
I took part in the search.
I'd stay and talk, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We stayed quiet.
Stay home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and close the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay at the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Curiosity over me won.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get out of the chair and help!
We'll invite you.
We can do better than that.
Can you do it on your own?
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
I chose the path of the slightest resistance.
My phone's ringing!
The bells rang.
The bells started ringing.
They screwed up.
I twisted my ankle.
We'll get used to everything.
I'm getting used to it.
The habit is a different nature.
I used to live alone.
I'm used to winning.
He's used to not having hot food every day.
You'll get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
