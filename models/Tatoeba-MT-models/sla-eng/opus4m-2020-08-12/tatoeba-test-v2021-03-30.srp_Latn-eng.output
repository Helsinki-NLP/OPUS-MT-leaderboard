Tom's gonna get better.
Tom works in marketing.
They're a quintet of tin tobacco tools.
I don't care if our team wins or not.
How far is it from here?
What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little depressed.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps moaning about how she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it fast.
She didn't even blink.
What did all this mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean something to me if you could do it to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the job done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappoint me.
It's no big deal.
How much will I take?
I'm teasing you.
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head, and if you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left the keys.
Where did you get that scar?
You wouldn't think by her looks, but the story of the kid who ate two cakes was from her childhood.
I can't live that kind of life.
Tom's hungry as a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everybody's crying.
Octopus Paul was right.
He loves football so much.

I'm not ready yet.

Do you think games and learning are compatible?
I think that's totally funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What year is your car?
The bill, please.
Make sure the cat's outside and the door's locked when you leave.
It remains to be seen if I can get there on time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom got his fingers on the table nervously.
Did you go out last night?
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrumental music.
You should thank Tom with a letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.
We have one victim.

How can I protect myself?
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.

Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.
Tom wants to work at the same hospital Mary works for.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom.
Another store is about to open in Boston.
I was shocked.
Tom's well-being.
Tom told me this morning that he and Mary are moving to Boston.
Can you save me some cookies?
I'm allergic to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolates.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat the soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna let this go.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried this before.
Did I drop that?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because she's a male chauvinist pig.
I've been all over Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have a high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Is this what you told Tom?
Everyone's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where'd she go?
I think you can do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.
They have improved security procedures and are now better prepared than before.

I can't help it.
Her boyfriend wasn't supportive.
The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That may not be easy.
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I passed every test.
I'm sick of you whining.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll take a look.
He's very busy now.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kylie Minaugh since June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
Yesterday I went to bed without brushing my teeth.
Danger lurks at every corner.
When I was in high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're getting careless.
Is it necessary to make so much noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come and run with me.
Drive faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't escape the past.
Please excuse me for being late.

Do you have a dog?
They'll be fine.
The family had dinner at noon.
I thought you were going on a Boston bus.
They're gonna clean my room.
Tom and I aren't friends, we're just colleagues from work.
I don't see who that is.
Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were as cold as ice.
One day it'll be mine.

Don't stop.
Tom managed to escape just in time.
I love watching you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
I can't answer your question with any certainty.
God save me!
None of us have seen Tom do that.
Let's talk about possibilities.
I was just about to suggest you do that.
She decided to go and study in the United States.
It was really inspiring.

Next time, I'm sure it'll be better.
The text's been reworked.
We're all trying to win.

I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Jom brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Medieval Reef, a mountain range located at the bottom of the ocean, at depths of up to 4,500 meters.
Yeah, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do it?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament has been dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree to that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came to the window.
It was something that led to a flood of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's heavy.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never repented of that.
She was intrusive.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes.
I wasn't worried about that.

Did you tell Tom this?
You'll ruin your sight if you play games all the time.
I'm an Earthling.
I can read foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are gonna happen.
Say hello to your friends.
What, you still can't drive?
I forgot.
It'll take me a while to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not going to land.
You're kind of right.
Even though I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
It's as simple as beans.
I'm doing a lot of things well.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We'll pay you a visit sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
You're wasting your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was on purpose.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequences.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you going to do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better if you don't eat after 7:00 at night.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.
You were right to shave.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Tom lives downtown.
Don't be impertinent.
Things are very different now.
I'm curious.

I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
You're contagious.
We need your help.
Is Tom notified?
Tofu's doing well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I don't feel like swimming.
She's as pretty as her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some room.
It's not standing.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come on in.
You won!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so difficult to imagine that the motions of the board were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I reacted instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you hang videos on YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you fully recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining.
Tom's sick today.
That's what both of them like.

Come on in.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You've got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Start counting.
You can never come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his faults.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come back tomorrow.
He ended up in jail.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink the water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom's saving up money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called favoritism, and if she's promoted, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.
Tom's really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I'm here.
We are what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut your dirty mouth.
Show me your papers.

I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.

I'm on Tom's side.

I love this song.
Tom was John's best man.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a bigger friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a molar.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're absolutely right.
They can never achieve it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance at that.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom's laughing, Mary.
It's almost 3:30.
I don't know if that'll be enough money for me.
Can you pull up the curtains?
Have you ever tried it?
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied up his seat belt.
I thought it was yellow.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firmly against compromise.
Everything has a price.
Tom picked up Mary.
I may not be sleeping tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
Jawbreaker is a round multilayer candy like a pearl.
What's your problem?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everyone was laughing.
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't fight.
Just be careful, Tom.
I'll get it.
I'm in better shape than you.
Maybe they're around the lake somewhere.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Get out of here, Tom.
It's impossible to say for sure.
Tom never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Go ahead.
It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One of the senators called the president of another country, I'm officer of the old intelligence services who would like to regain the old empire of that country.
Would you like some more tea?
The nail pierced the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you a question?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things are over.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sam was Layla's dance partner.
Little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt about it.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wasn't gonna do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit tight for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher is furious if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope it's dry weather.
Could you take a look around and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm only listening to you.
He's rarely angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from his duties in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't look so pale.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom's proposing could save us all some time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of that.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love at once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this at lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We have to respect our personal rights.
What's that thing with your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he didn't.
Yumi's gonna be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother's a Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's nobody like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
The limbs are numb from the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
Did you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary's a Catholic, but her boyfriend's an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't stretch.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
It took four kilos of gold to gold the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to get numbers in his head.
Keep an eye on me, and I'll keep an eye on you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak plainly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income is down by ten percent.
It can be hard to go around an unknown terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, I ended up doing things at random.
That's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're shrinking.
Can you talk to me?
Turn the TV down.
I wear short-sleeved T-shirts in summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis's tent?
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I'm just on my way.
She spends three bucks a day on lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad for lying.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, the porn will be made with that.
Canada is an ice hockey country.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving up so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is without a doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I shouldn't have said that.
She joggs every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a really bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
I didn't do it either.
How much is a bottle of beer?
Tom is so rich, even his servants have servants.
That's too bad!
I'm tired of arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
That train's passed you.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
Better nice than strong.
There's trouble waiting for you.
There is no word for "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We've been talking about this all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I wasn't told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather kept me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I've been honest and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You're getting fat real fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a second.
I knew I should never have interfered with your stupid business.
We've been working together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving up to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I are headed for something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without any difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
I just won't do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid addicts on color thinners.
I liked that one.
Do you like rollercoasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom smile?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends teased her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was going around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you stop by sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look how big she is!
Mary's the wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having a hard time talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna make it.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black grand piano with dramatic fingertips, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches off the trees last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't help but feel partially responsible.
People have been good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
I could come with you.
Have some.
Come on in.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
To join the choir, it's necessary that you know how to read notes.
Tom took a nap.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful to everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human being to always take precedence over the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was present at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stupid, insensitive kids can sometimes grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like it to be with you.
It's the police's job to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hate of others.
This is gonna make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
The monks could play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Drive to work for an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm a natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us view such views as pure madness.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any of Mary's letters until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with a lot of trouble.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
It's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
The mother and daughter represented two generations.
He's drawn to himself that he has to work in the garden two hours a day.
Apples and pears are donated, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting report is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes for as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
It was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "But do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." "And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review to Mac." "Yes." "What did you say to her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Phillips' screwdriver was convincing, but not seductive; and that Rerity was severely charging things I thought she should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People have been nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I'm only going to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He turned on the torch before he went into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's truth to what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of you whining.
Get out!
We've got two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm looking into it right now.
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
The two sides will be giving speeches this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the cast.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That guy needs help.
Defend yourself.
He caught a cab to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's an impostor.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
It's your election.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I've seen the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad I'm leaving.
The eagle is the emperor of birds.

Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've misunderstood this.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm grounded.
The cat lay stretched out with the entire length of the sunlight that penetrated the window.
Walk or bike to school?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't exactly impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Maria knows that her main weapon, her beautiful face, and her young body, are transitory values.

He's trying.
Two states negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That's what sleep needs.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very kind of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I instinctively reacted.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked breasts and barefoot.
She's just out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's take a look at it again.
Sounds like treason to me.
That's what you need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote "Grab the hot dogs!"
Drive slow.
What a man you are!
Double measure, once cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to many people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get any sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You're never on time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll make sure I don't disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make progress.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We've got to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was moaning from the pain.
Everything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
You're embarrassing him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom is rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope he's gonna be okay.
The wind has calmed down.
I have a mirror in my bedroom from floor to ceiling.
I wish I could've thought of that.
Don't make a sound.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-check festival took place in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.

Tom means the same way.
That's how you act important.
How long have you stayed?

Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.

I changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thinking creatures, only if they got that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.

It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.

Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.

You look fat.
English, you have to learn one step at a time.
He's better off now than he was before.
Tom and Mary differ like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment to him. One such desire is also a desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become completely sick from eternal life, and he would yearn for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.

I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes daily.

I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a bum.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.

I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message to Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you find out?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom tricked you.
He's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
As a child, many violent criminals were ruthlessly torturing animals.
How long are you gonna be mad and yelling at us?
How much does that really matter?
Shall we have an appetizer?
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom confessed to that.
It's hard working with you.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
It takes a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom is very considerate.
When are you going to go?
This report wasn't written very well.
She points out that this last move by the government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.

I wanted to help you.
You've been really nice to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just an essay problem, it's all these destructive questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky guess.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were there for me.
Try this.
Clean up a little bit.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do it either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I got badly burned.
Stand back.

Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get serious.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into it.
Hang on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled a thicker end.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started to learn English when I was 12 years old. I was then interested in languages, but not to that extent. I now speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't take it.
Anything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're thorns in the eye like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm sorry.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Learn by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
He won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Have some.
He's talking about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused, he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
Reaction isn't always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.

Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice, it's very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the filename before you try to recover the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.

I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom was getting ready for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Don't be a wuss.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom get a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was a big supporter.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.

I was very shaken by the news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer a cup of tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There's no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
I can't believe all this.

Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a mail?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give it to me.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was beautiful.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved slowly forward.

Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.

Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
That's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not taking part.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do it either.
Did you pass the exams?
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typo error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom's got a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got bad hair.
I've seen enough so far.
That's what I hate.
We're gonna miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could come with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you disarm the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.

How many times have you been here?

Please, shut up as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to face this.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where'd you find the keys?
Have you ever posted a video on YouTube?

Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.

I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep your mouth shut all the time?
He took off his clothes.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
He's driving a posse.
My right hand is numb.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a big success.
Have a seat, please.
Does that happen often?
A little birdie told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I quit.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.

Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you hand me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more diligently.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do that.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend wasn't supportive.
I didn't care.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for kids.
That's been hard on me.
What did you figure out?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a typfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was on Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a petty man.
Control yourself.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Several trees fell during the storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her before.
Everyone smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I give up.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.

That helps us a lot.

I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?

Word spread fast.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't know how to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
The costs will rise soon.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.

Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you guys okay?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.

Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom's named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm gonna take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.

Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
What makes you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She wrapped her hair in the papilotnas.
He's been released from military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge liberates us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends is coming?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play many times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might be trying to convince Mary to do it.
She's making a mosquito an elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me a pen.
Just tell Tom I called.

Are you done washing dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do it.
Tom's gonna pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.

Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.

As busy as Tom is, he never forgets to email his shirt at least once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.

Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.

I'm gonna take a nap in about an hour.
Now I'm pretty happy.

It's been a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was watching closely.

Tell us the ghost story.
Check everyone.
The session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.

That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese to thin pieces or to small cubes.

I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.

I knew you wouldn't know how to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad for lying.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Is this what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with it will happen eventually.
That's a good French rule.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never got over his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
They all sat down.
If you have nothing else to do, then the number of the Greek islands.
She's always wearing snotty clothes.
Is that gonna work out soon?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The gifts of Vishnu are called the Vishnuans; the Shiva are the Shiva.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I completely lost my mind.
I never regretted doing it.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Romani?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things people make I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned down Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This is beyond all bounds.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy on Monday.
Both my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "if not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move over.
We should study.
We don't have a choice.
When it's time like this, it's best you sit home and don't go out.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During the observational experiment, Tom couldn't describe any pictures from his living room wall, even though he lived there for two years.
It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
They all held their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you work.
I hope we'll visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at 3:30.
I'm still a little tired.
To seek to maximize his own interest, happiness or security seems very natural for a human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes out of here.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not nearly as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we knocked down and discovered it was 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken up.
Boston's a great city.
We hope that people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're scared of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still doesn't have the experience for this job.
Can you help us?
You want to chill out?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of being a Serb, with their historic highest achievements - the slaughter of heads and genocides?
Do you know you're disarming the bomb?
Where did I leave my keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna take a look.
I wonder if anyone could help me, but I have a cell phone that just shows a message about a mistake.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You're underestimating me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak fluently to Hindi.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one's died... yet.
Can we, people, boil grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two blacks.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom was writing on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
Chances are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and tranquility, are a real masterpiece.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'm never gonna mention this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's being careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo at half past 11.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Watch out!
Tom couldn't give any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I was just on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole country's buzzing about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not a good time.
He's not a child anymore.
I try to air the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the boringst person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(not P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
It's an exception.
Tom came in a little early today than usual.
A horse could be eaten.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which one's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train on the way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
You're working slowly.
I didn't do it either.
The stories of Snore Sturluson tell, among other things, that Christianity in Norway was spread by violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourselves at home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gold chain with hearts is a necklace that will "shake your world".
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining hard.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
The dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do the right thing the first time.
Marie jumped in the river from the window.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary are always walking around holding hands.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look how big it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality is checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to draw your attention to one or another thing about you, your attitude or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a big mess.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt you for just a moment?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intention.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.

Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He canceled his last-minute meeting.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Mary the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of Norway's population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's perfectly normal.
They say a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is $5.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he slept heavily.
I never thought of that.
Keep it down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
He wouldn't like it.
I'm really curious.
Tom double-parked.
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do about Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
I didn't see anything.
Any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest on the capital invested were several million.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys were laughing.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I disagree with you completely.
Do you keep this place for anyone?
How are you these days?
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea has risen, a sea of people.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.

There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hate us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works around nine o'clock all the time.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'm gonna take a shower.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that pleases the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should run the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans took precedence over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
It makes me very angry.
Is there still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very kind of you.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom's tough but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate a sausage with a potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a layman.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became a victim of a conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both as rich as we'd like.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his bad point.
You're one of us.
He's in the grave with one leg.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Why are rabbits' ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to work things out in the process.
This one's so cool.
I was just enjoying myself.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this essay.
We hate Tom.
This one's so cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
It's a very big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get away with it.
I just want to get out of the way.
Don't let it slip away from you like this.
Be careful.
She's in her first year of college.
I asked for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My liquid knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we stop that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the bassoon.
The secretary of the United States, John Carrie, broke his right femur in a bicycle accident Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of midwives, they're kilo kids.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are creaking.
Have you fully recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
An accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom didn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be a little more modest this year.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house yesterday for dinner.
Look at the size of it!
It's true.
You're very uneducated.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now's a great time to buy one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You don't have to judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
Tim is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are these plans, then?
The kids are asleep.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and blew up a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Phase one's over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even extra money.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the boringst person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn at your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna be fine.
It is important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not being liked by anyone.
The brakes are creaking.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was 13.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and have a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go out with Tom for a while.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A female chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing you can do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it all wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where'd you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.

In this phase of world history, in America there is not one such thing as an independent press. You know that I know that. Among you there is no one who dares to write his honest opinion, and if you wrote it, but would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I get my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper for which I work. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks, would find yourself outside, on the street, looking for another job. If I let my right opinion appear in just one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours. The job of a journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie, to slander, to slander, to comfort the monster in front of whose leg is lying, to sell this country and to our people for our daily life are playing the same potential as an independent player.

There's no need to worry about it.
I want to see you.

Something wonderful happened today.

Let it go, Tom.
I'm not gonna tell anyone that you did it.
How long is the Nile?
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Let's stretch our legs.
Are you done?

We haven't had enough yet.
You underestimated me.
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
He's a criminal, you know that?
Tom's getting married next month.
For what?
Are we safe now?

I must say, I envy you.
We need to be quiet.
Maria refused the offer because she thought she'd be better off at the bank.

You were made for me.
Are you busy here?
We're out of food.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
What's a married life like?

I can't even imagine that.
I have no intention of changing.

Stop talking.
I can't forget that.

I've been waiting.
This money will really help.
It's all the same before the law.

He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
I didn't care.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I'm not buying it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everybody says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about the plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
He looks young for his age.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to trick?
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
What have you done now?
I'm sure you can do it.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
There was a new snow avalanche on the road to Eceskaret, Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night and it is not known if anyone is trapped in an avalanche.
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix my own car.
Zini!
Please hurry.
Tom nodded.
Do we have to tell anyone?
He's flooded with cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more of a psychological problem than a physical one.
He's out.
He started yelling.
Tom could have been better.
Tom got fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't get carried away.
That meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about it.
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
I don't have any homework today.
Tom and Mary get along just fine.
When can Tom come home?
I see a reflection of my face in the window.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could have spared me coming here if you had told me I shouldn't have been here today.
This is going to make this so much easier for us.
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to college in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the toilet seat up.
Shall we see Tom again?
You're gonna have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours a day.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Tom will probably still be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I don't fall for it.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted that he was a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Are we starting soon?
You can't go into that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the entire manual for work on 321 pages in breath.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.
What's your eye hurt?
How old are you?
Did I get that?
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked in years.
What a beautiful house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It was getting dark.
Don't get in Tom's way.
I really like to practice.
You have to go to school.
That book costs 3,000 yen.
I just started working here today.
She doesn't like to be told what to do.
The fashions are getting old and dying.
Many words are borrowed from foreign languages.
Tom never forgave me for doing that.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Basically, my dear Watson.
History is written by the winners.
I'm deeply ashamed.
The writer of the book "Last Mexican," James Fenimor Cooper, was the first nature conservation fighter.
We should start over.
He has great experience and his competence has spread in several areas.
That's enough!
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What's all the fuss?
Tom's confidence was shattered when his boss took it off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I'm probably not gonna watch this.
Come on in.
Did I call you?
Most are afraid to set a great goal for themselves because they fear that they will never reach it.
I'm naughty.
I know.
That's all I care about.
They were sitting on the grass, playing ukulele and singing.
I can't imagine life without books.
This building is blue.

It's a really nice day out there.
This must be important.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
It is the third city, in size, in Serbia.
What year was your car made?
Sit tight.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What am I supposed to tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't go on like that in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's learning hard.
It takes a lot of imagination to try to add a new sentence here.
Things might have turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked.
Finish this.
He came to see you yesterday.
Tom's having a bad day.
Don't answer that.
Did the red rose bloom?
I'd like to leave.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Pride tends to become pride, which is a close breed of madness.
How long is Tom gonna last?
The rainy season begins in June.
Who knows what's gonna happen tomorrow?
I've changed my schedule.
I wish I could paint like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.
We limit our luggage to ten kilos apiece.
We'll never go back there.
It's been years.
They established the Air Force Joint Command where the Director and Chief of Staff were, respectfully, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his ukulele and started singing.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try it.
It's a mess here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's so bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
The lie got him in trouble when his boss found out the truth.
It looks good for its age.
I really like my team members.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister, Mary.
I could've used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll make sure I find them.
I could lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what to do.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we know.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really that happy?
The fuse's dead.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows how to knock real fast.
She sometimes writes to her son.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried about getting lost.
I think it's best to be kind.
Africa is the cradle of mankind.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite lecturer was Jackson.
I'm not the only one who didn't like that movie.
Don't you remember the question?
I like it when it's cold.
Don't jump!
I didn't know.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm compassionate.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a petty man, isn't he?
Better a kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You have to speak up.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Did you have lunch?
How much is this gonna cost me?
I'm a hero.
There's a female version for every man.
Are you talking about us?
Mary felt hurt when her children couldn't make an effort to contact her on March 8.
Tom was saving money to buy a car.
I'm not surprised at all.
How much money do we need?
This model can be combined with any color.
Today is June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
I just got here.
All you have to do is practice.
I've been so busy with Tataebo again that I almost dehydrated.
We have to do this.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass playing ukulele.
Before this decision comes into force, no one will move a finger to solve this.
Do you have something to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
It's become a habit for me to do that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom doing at work?
That's what the doctor needs.
I want to be a man again someday.
Why is it so complicated?
What am I doing here?
Tom often wears black.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
Danger lurks around every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom sells cars.
Anybody want a beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I have an idea.
Tom bought a hulahop.
They'll know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
Mom transplanted the flowers into the garden.
Tom's not confused.
I get the impression he's pretty arrogant.
Tell him I'm innocent.
It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
Her dissertation must be written in English.
Now I have to go.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
After she won the lottery, she went out shopping.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Go to sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
Intelligence satellite is capable of monitoring many of the ground's activities, listening to communication lines, registering the operating frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.
I doubt you'll find it hard to get a driver's license.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Mary are playing chess with a set of hand-carved chess figures allegedly from ivory.
If the order already exists, the system you can receive and send an email will function.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take off your coat?
I'm really proud of that.
I think we should focus on other things.
Did your girlfriend like the flowers?
I'm a little new at this.
This should work.
Nancy's from London.
I'll call.
It is the largest third city in Serbia.
FIFA consists of 209 associations.
Everybody's been waiting.
Tom told me he lost his notebook.
We've got enough here.
We drove him out of the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
I'm homeless.
I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going on a Boston bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could've used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs over the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I like what you wrote.
Don't look so pale.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope Tom's predictions come true.
If we'd gotten here sooner, maybe we could have saved Tom.
Why are you leaving?
There's gold in the green forests.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom was sitting very still.
Norway has a lot of old empty barns.
She worked so hard she eventually got sick.
I'm not the fashion guy.
I can't forget her eyes.
Show me your papers!
I've never tried this before.
Sugar dissolves in hot coffee.
I can't believe you lied to me.
Tom writes nice.
She was prescribed a medical cannabis to relieve unwanted effects of chemotherapy.
Come see me after work.
Are you involved in this?
So you want to learn another language.
What day is it tomorrow?
Tom put off his drink.
Maybe he'll come and see us tonight.
The air conditioner's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
Would you like some more mashed potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Such a project naturally required a budget rebalancing.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay my rent.
I didn't do it either.
There's a guard outside.
I'll be in my neighborhood.
We'll go over it again.
I'm not nervous about that.
It's fun.
Girls like to play houses.
I wish I hadn't done that.
The train arrived on time today, as always.
Do you want to talk to Tom for me?
Norway is my new country.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Has anyone told Tom about this yet?
Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not the right guy for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this distraction?
Tom could convince Mary to do it.
Was I really that happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What did you do today?
How much will I take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm leaving early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what that is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get out of here!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you being childish?
We could have saved Tom only if we had arrived a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have something to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I'm supposed to buy a new coat because my old man's licked.
The troll wall is the highest European vertical mountain wall that has 1,700 meters to the bottom, of which is 1,000 metres of vertical cliff.
I'd like to introduce you to Tom.
There is little doubt that cutting in the already shaved system will have dramatic consequences for industry and municipalities in rural areas.
You were offended by that, even though it didn't have that meaning at all, and it was supposed to be something funny on my part, but you didn't see it that way.
Who's got time for this?
I'm still asleep.
Tom's a day trader.
My stomach hurts.
We calculated that we could get to that place within two weeks.
I passed all the tests.
Mary works as a waitress at a nearby coffee shop.
Let me explain.
I forgot the baby-watching device.
She reacted to it.
I'm naked.
What do you have there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
Have a good week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sports.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing flannel pajamas.
I'm scared to death.
There was only one little problem.
I'm all alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't sure at all.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The planes are landing at the airports.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always looks dissatisfied.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overreacting.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at 7:00 in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us overcome this.
I've already been paid.
They're all stuck.
Did I call you?
Come Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't stare.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the shrivell, indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I've been all over Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't stare.
You asked for it.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm devastated.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department laughed at her for her clothes.
They've either been through it or gone through it.
I'll get right on it.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy a walk along the road of pilgrimage in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you watch it?
Are you busy here?
I choose between two options.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at 7:30.
We didn't do it.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, pass me the salt.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have any paper I can write on?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We were just having dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of Christmas sales books, and it's hardly going to get thrown out of position by some book.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make so much noise?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
Get changed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people have gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well-prepared in advance.
I don't count on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls wore weed skirts and had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?
Tom's the only breadwinner in the family.
He may have already left.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for cross-calculations, insert and use simple tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I've been reformed.
What's next time?
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was sophisticated.
This sad story was written at the time Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove it?
It's a dead end.
It's so easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I'd rather not be involved at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what both of them like.
It must have been terrible.
I'll lend you a workbook if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as me.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do you want to meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
The pin is a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the personality and the blood type has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I did check some things.
I don't sing.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The data transfer working group, led by Ben Mani, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say if you step on a rainworm, it'll start to rain.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Tom knows he knocks real fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up like that.
I give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
I might need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one came.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That'd be okay.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me right now.
There's no established policy.
Write down what I say.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
She was saving a living head.
I think we should call a doctor.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom in the act.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you up to with all this?
Mary makes a living by sewing.
Could you hand me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementaryly, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to get you.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
The drugs are usually not to be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people, no matter what time they are, don't lose their beauty.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty amazing.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
She was dressed in red.
What does a sociologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope is lost when you experience a difficult situation and a senseless stiffness.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is pure energy output.
It seemed to me Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dance?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really that individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialty?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't have influenced it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
Tim is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never been camping.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian isn't easy, but it's wonderful.
That's what I think.
I prefer a tent with a storm blanket, along with cross-bars for wind stability and snowy applications, and this has to be a two-layer tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we meeting?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's been fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's interrogating the patient.
Tom had his drink.
This is a justice lair.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I always knew that.
Don't bludgeon.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in their own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We split up on the corner.
Are you mad about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that work out for me?
Did you sleep?
They tried hard in court.
Is there a reason you're keeping these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I have your dictionary?
No one else has been hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started studying French last year.
Tom was sitting on the bench all day writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
The money's talking.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I double-parked.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I was about to come looking for you.
He's leading a stormy life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.
Anatomy breast implants, however, can also lead to breast deformation if they rotate to the side.
Where'd you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did this.
She tried.
Tom was a little dazed.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports to take a closer look at them.
I'm not as rich as we'd like.
Get on board.
Tom's still pissed.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet isn't your personal army.
I could come with you.
Sadly, he moved from Almighty God to become a powerless, dirty, small and insignificant man in the corner of a small province in a vast empire.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says it's gonna rain tomorrow afternoon.
Tom's a real gentleman.
I saw the snake.
It's useless.
What planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we have a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind's coming from.
Women are the most beautiful thing in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is charged in advance.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes it most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
Yesterday, I finished my bachelor studies on Duoling.
Tom was attacked by Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
All I'm gonna say is, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom's being listened to because he's convincing.
My suitcase isn't packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were suffering, waiting at least three months before they got an answer.
Do you know anyone who passed last year's exam?
Mary took the day off for the trip.
They live on a high foot.
Tom got out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen this guy before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't support me very much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything, just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human to sin, to forgive is divine.
I passed all the tests.
I just needed some time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black jeans.
Must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this seat taken?
It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the change.
All parking spaces are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
Use the device until it alerts you to charge the battery and then fill it 5 hours to reach maximum capacity.
Tom's still a bachelor.
You're getting careless.
No, don't do that.
I had a house when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not gonna ask Tom to do that.
They were all standing.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you hand me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy.
Did he fulfill his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my house?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually have for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said was gonna happen.

Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things must pass.
Get in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't have a wish for it.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom looks a little repulsive.
I loved the fact that my wife knows how to cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times as much testosterone as women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck because of something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt about it!
Looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You disappoint me.
We'll get right on it.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The fuse's gone too far.
Are we safe now?
Tom says he's gonna do it someday.
Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's tricky.
She wears gold chains around her neck.
Electronics provides a more gradual and simple adaptation of air flow.
Have you heard that he's finally back home?
During the clear days, we see Mount Fuji in the distance.
It's your election.

It's a multi-phase process.
I think you've been very generous.
Tom might have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.
The assembly is adjourned.
Tell me what you wrote.

You know, don't you?
I'm trying.

That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat at the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete faith in you.
Have you ever listened to such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He threw the ball at the goal!
It's a big day, son!
We were filled with joyful anticipation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'll forgive you, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Wipe your lips with a napkin.

Did you tell Tom Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.

Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.

When they experienced the French Revolution, citizens became free people, liberated traditions and churches, praising freedom, equality, and brotherhood.
I didn't think it was appropriate.
Tom offered to help when everything seemed to go completely wrong.
To translate it or not is a moral choice of translators. Things sometimes sound better if they stay the way they are in the language they're made in.

I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm pathetic.
How long have you lived here?
Do you think the situation will improve?

Scientists believe that finding always comes as lightning from the sky.

The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's accurate.
I've never seen that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their proximity was mysterious, given that they only met three days ago.
I've done that before.
What year was your car made?
I tried to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would be good if I put on another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the chiffoner.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
Under what name?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Where on earth have you been?
She smiled.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
Chances were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom Mary did this?
You tried.

Tom will wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.

I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.

Let me see your prescription.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes fights between families spread through generations.
It's all because he's upside down.
Tom thinks fast.
Comments have to be on the subject.
Don't get carried away.
The programme sets the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Are you feeling okay today?

Tom counted the change.
I studied hard when I was in school.
I said no to Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert mirage.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you being honest?
We'll try it your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one was watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never repented of that.
Tom was as angry as a lynx.
Tom might have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends teased her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very soon.
We all did it.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay off my debt.
Which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.
His speech was, to put it mildly, a disaster.

She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to help yourself?
I could go there now.
Everyone cheered.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have any perfume?
Don't play the monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
Make a face like that make you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.

Not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's so hot in here.
Have you fully recovered?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to have survived the accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because it's too crowded.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom's gone.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Drive slow.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cat, please don't cross.
Just give me a chance.
What's making you smile?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm amazed.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
That's great!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was on Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I don't think about it.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you come by sometime?
We all did it.
What have you done now?
Answer me right now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget to do our homework.
It would be nice if you waited for me.
They were sitting in a circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We're just in time.

It's not connected.

We finally have all the names of the fields in Norway and it will be of great help to our users.

I want to see you!
It's on your left.
Where's the bathroom?
That's not like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our work much easier.
Tom got involved with people who had a very bad influence on him.

It's up to you to choose.
The world network was invented in 1989 by Tom Berners Lee.
Maybe Tom will agree to do it.
Don't put your elbows on the table.

It's a big day, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep an eye on him.
Be home by 7:30.
That's not all we have.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I recommend you visit the British War Museum in London.
He got a lucky cat's birthday from his workmate.

Do you like it or not?
Life goes on!

I liked that one.

You pay me well.
Tom said okay.
I don't want to discuss this right now.

Tom's right this time.

A lot has happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I give up.
What's on your mind?
I gave them a anniversary present.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really that happy?
Do I feel like it?
That's how I figured it out.
Tom wrote several hundred articles and several books.
Come on in.
What do you mean?
Tom recorded Mary's phone number.
There's a good chance we'll win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can only walk for about three kilometers all the time.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a garbage man.
Beer's good.

Tom's stalled.
If you don't understand, you have to say it.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll yell.
Don't cheat.
That's another one!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
The mileage depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What have you done now?
The sun was shining, and yet it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.
Tom could get lost.
He begged me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.

I'm very proud of that.
What did you tell Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three pre-defined modes to achieve optimal results.
That's encouraging news.
You shouldn't be out now. lt's almost 11:00.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Projects like this never end.
I prefer orange apples.
Here's a secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let it get in your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What year is your car?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those among you who are likely offended; that was not my intention.
I told you it would work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Criminals should be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom seems a little nasty.
I shot a bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote myself.

You're asking me questions you already know the answers to.
I didn't see anything.

I'm not that happy.
Anybody want a beer?
If anything sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
I won't say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I get a cab?
Tom signed Mary as a check payer.
Open up.
Tom is very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
Neither can I.
Do you like rollercoasters?
If it's not okay, then it's not over.
Let's go, folks.
Are you being sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't make fun of others.
Have you completely recovered?
I'm proud of that.
Where did I put the keys?
There's an obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Mind your own business!
She licked the spoon.
What did you figure out?
We know that's not true.
We're all gonna die.

Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to smile and endure.
Cigarettes cost two Marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
This is how it was supposed to be.
Tom got nervous about you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I have your dictionary?
Tom ate a whole box of chocolates on his own.
Can we do this later?
The truth has to be told.
Do you like costumes?
Haven't you done enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart about that.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it with simple words.
That's just coffee without caffeine.
Tom pulled the stopper out of the bottle.
We should get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom sleeps all the time.
I really like your music.
This is Kopacana!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else is using this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
Tom never thought of trying to convince Mary to do it.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I completely disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
There's nothing going on with me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom hit the switch.
My children need me.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it wasn't enough.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We've got enough seats for everyone.
It was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get lice.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom gone by noon.
Tom looked terrified.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
It won't help if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going on a Boston bus.
Tom still doesn't have much time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is it all settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No. What's the matter?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
The pen I'm writing with belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary stayed good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom muffled his smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom is the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
I guess I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Stay away from my girl.
I'm sorry I even tried.
I'm not bitter at all.
Yumi is one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking off her clothes.
Both up and down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
I'm firmly against this.
You're underestimating me.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes in French.
The police haven't ruled out the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The hard work paid off.
Tom asked me if he should help Mary or not.
I was just thinking about you.
Signal lights are used to transmit Morse code.
It doesn't go any further than Main Street, but you can catch number 31.
The worst is yet to come.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
A lot of people already hate you.
If I'd known your e-mail address, I'd have written to you.
Tom could beat anybody up.
I'm trying my best here.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
The government has fallen.
Tom drank a sip of wine.
This is gonna take forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I completely disagree with you.
They're gone.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write efficiently.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in one day.
It had a much different effect than it was meant to have.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all stopped.
The book's sold.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
It needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I have no doubt he will succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My father's grandmother enjoys the tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They've fooled everyone.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must show their credentials, registration papers and license during the inspection.
Tom looks like a girl.
Do we have one of those?
How does that come together?
We don't get along well with our neighbors.
Do you like writing?
They decided to get married.
What's Tom drinking?
Exercise has a lot of benefits.
That's what scientists argue about.
He's trying.
Tom told me his father died.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be cuter.
Tom has a strong German accent.
Tom asked Mary to scratch it on a piece of her back that she couldn't reach.
He's over there.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
Does Tom have a key?
Tom's getting ready.
You always do.
There are situations in chess where it's worth sacrificing a figure to gain a long-term advantage.
Young children should learn to sympathize with animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a picture of your house.
Tom put off his drink.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
Spice's empty.
Tom's decided against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't have done this without your help.
Don't answer that.
If you did it for me, it would help a lot.
He was naked chest and barefoot.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm completely broke.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a second?
Don't let it get in your head.
My right hand's numb.
That's enough!
I sell coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped in the water and didn't take his clothes off.
I'm a little crazy.
I'd be happy to say yes.
Every bird flies its flock.
Do you want to see the total eclipse of the sun that will leave Svalbard in the dark on March 20, 2015?
I sleep tight.
Did you eat anything?
Emma was very impressive at the party.
What did you just write in the notebook?
I know it's illegal.
I studied hard when I was in school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.
Do you live there?
I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They differ like heaven and earth.
Tom was all alone.
The cavalry has arrived.
They've all been asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents anything.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, the great and multinational one, in the great Tver region, the size of several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What have you done to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to knock on a typewriter, and he told his teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'll go outside and eat.
Can I talk to you outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I did a good job.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this in mind for you.
Tom's selling the car.
He started screaming.
Tom was clearly upset.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really that happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a thousand-dollar hat.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom worked his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what both of them like.
Something's come up.
Help, police, help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom will miss you so much.
What's your name?
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this distraction.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is kind of an exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have many friends.
We don't know what he's bringing tomorrow.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
I'm amazed.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to come camping with us next weekend?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Drive safe.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People tell me things.
Cheers!
Tom's in his pajamas.
Did Tom believe your story?
I was very tired, so I went to bed early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom's a salesman, too.
I want to feel important.
We'd give anything to keep it from happening.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everybody's standing.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
You can never get a piece of shit so it doesn't stink.
Don't rush.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my ears red?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, the chance to work on a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and prospects for advancement.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Is it all settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still only a product of human thought independent of experience, is so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
That's what he risked.
His wife patched up his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always grumpy.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've grown fat.
They're not mine.
I'm doubling the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of an interview was made and published across the Internet.
Tom got drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we get some rest?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do it either.
Do you have something to report?
I say it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom took a muffled breath.
There's a lot of work to be done before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when you speak fast.
It'll be half past three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Zurich is considered one of the major financial centres.
That one's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just taking my time.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not stretch out.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a tough job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I feel worse."
Everything is fleeting, but the beautiful memories are alive.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Which one's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that spilled a glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd have saved time if we'd gone down Park Street.
A cop arrested him for driving in a drunk state.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I got lucky.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Run over any obstacle to this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Luck was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children all their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
What's fast is short.
Come sit next to me.
I found him a book.
I've barely managed to hide my resentment for her insolence.
Butter is made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
I passed the exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the guts to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
Are we meeting tonight?
