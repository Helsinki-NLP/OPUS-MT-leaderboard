Therefore, each of us needs to consider the reasons for such unsuccessful matches.
In advance of the meetings, we need to prepare and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably be able to fix it by now.
But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unity.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the “Taibay Bill” by the United States
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Taibay Bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the Council of the PRC for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval of the US Senate Committee on International Relations of the Bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and of gross interference in China's internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguan.
He said Taiwan was a part of China and related issues related to China ' s domestic affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, to immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and to immediately stop interfering with the Taiwanese issue in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, he noted.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be halted by anyone and by no force, emphasized Ma Xiaoguan.
TickTok hides uncomfortable videos from users
According to TickTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of them under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that refer to Tianyanmen Square, Tibet's independence or the prohibited religious group Falungun, says The Guardian.
The documents issued by the publication show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) has promoted China ' s foreign policy objectives abroad by means of an annex.
The main part of the violations related to China ' s policy fall under “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unfavorable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that social networking does not appear to be censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “critical or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tianyanmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under “the history of China or other countries”.
The document also lists the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or government figures”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen Yin, Indian politicians Mahatma Gandhi, US Presidents Donald Trump and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Kyn Hee, Indonesian President Joko Vidododo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and may lead to the blocking of the user.
Not too severe violations are in the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to the TikTok algorithms.
The HomeDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: “We use a localized approach for modernization today, as well as independent local professionals.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says co-founder Rustem Bogdanov.
The "Producer Centre" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All bloggers' advertising material "Producer Center" agrees with the representatives of the social council, but user material can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov transmits.
On the question of whether TikTok can be spoken of as politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers with a firm answer and says he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: “The basic rules for users of TikTok are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content, discriminatory statements, etc.”.
But any content that the moderators do not like can be placed under these rules, Zaripov notes.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TickTok.
According to TickTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of them under the age of 18.
Under the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TickTok.
Social administrators check their age by means of artificial intelligence: neurosetics analyze individuals and determine how old a person looks, reports Bogdanov.
If the neurosis decides that the user is younger, his account may be removed, he adds.
According to the RBC, Bytedance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of the WeWork Covorking.
Istanbul residents told of an earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake has caused panic in Turkey’s largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in Istanbul.
34 people were killed, ten of whom are still in hospitals.
Istanbul’s resident, Melike, admitted that she had had a panic attack for the first time in her life.

But I'm so ashamed now!" said the girl to the 360 TV channel.
“In Istanbul, there was a really strong earthquake
I can't go back yet!
But in general, I'm fine" - I shared my impressions with the political scientist Jaylan Ozgül.
Project manager Celine noted that the mayor of the city kept all the residents aware, but she said the city still felt small bumps of magnetud about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of communication immediately after the earthquake.

The results of the amputation examination of the child’s arm were reported in Rossvodnadzor
The child in Rostov region was amputated because of a doctor's error, reports "View" with reference to the site of the Rosstravnadzor territorial body.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm and was then plastered in a hospital in the Zernograd district.
After a while, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
As a result of the verification, irregularities in the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and volume of assistance, have been detected.

Russian warning of false calls from banks
In Russia, calls from fraudsters have increased to replace the bank’s phone number.
This is reported by Kommersanta with reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the controller transmitted more than 2.5 thousand telephone numbers to the operators of the various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
218 additional numbers have been blocked and 59 have been restricted to the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department, Artem Sychev, said that the number had been replaced by a wide range of Russian banks.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank ' s warnings of fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanka and Alpha Bank confirmed the increase in phone calls with a replacement number.
According to the Bilina Press Service, part of the information on phone fraud transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the numbers actually used by banks to communicate with clients were listed.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Centre Bank was planning to establish a fraud number base to which the operator would address each call to verify the number.
He explained that it would be necessary to amend the legislation to establish such a framework.

Stoltenberg discussed with Green Ukraine's NATO accession
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
That's what the ginsek said at the Columbia University in New York.
Responding to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue and also stressed that the time frame for Ukraine to join NATO had not been specified in its reply.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance was obliged to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards would write RT.
In Crimea, the Green Alternative to NATO was offered
President Vladimir Zelenski of Ukraine, instead of joining NATO, should pursue good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-Chair of the Assembly of the Slavs of the Republic of Crimea Roman Cegrinec reported this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat his predecessor's mistakes, but should listen to [US President] [Donald Trump's] council, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Cegrinec told reporters "RIA Novosti".
Cegrinec noted that Zelensky was a good actor but a bad politician.
He said it would only be possible for the Ukrainian President to remain in power if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier on 27 September, NATO's Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had interviewed Zelenski on the issue of the country's accession to the alliance.
He said that Ukraine was under an obligation to fulfil certain conditions.
On 5 June, Councilman Evgeny Balicki said that Ukraine's possible accession to the alliance did not guarantee better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Naymar.
Spanish Barcelona and former Brazilian football player Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the transition of the attacker to the French "Paris Saint-Jerman".
The case was almost brought to trial, but the Catalonians invited the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Femid.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Neymar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, had a curious focus: by agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward ended up at the PIC for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalonians and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not many Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on the late payment.
When Neumar’s claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Blue-Granite insists that the bonus was in favour of the full contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only a quarter of the 40 million euros were owed to the player and requires the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Barsa almost agreed to return the prodigal player to Catalonia.
It's true, the deal's broken, but the hope of turning forward remains.
And here, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not settled in advance, it would exclude the possibility of the Brazilian being returned.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he asked for assurances that the Catalonians would redeem him.

How to Increase Future Pensions and Do Not Recycle
He is able to pay his pension not only to the Fund of the RF but also to non-State pension funds.
NPFs are private companies, reports Volgogradska prasti.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them and in time returns interest money to you.
If you were interested in this method, first look at the NPF information on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds work under the same rules as federal laws.
Retirement points can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of your internship you miss for your pension.
This is a way for those who worked informally.
In addition, a contribution may be made for a relative, for example, for a housewife.
Recommendation for those who consider retirement at the beginning of their work path.
Staff members, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and persons who have spent a number of years in the Far North receive increased pension benefits.
Take care of this in advance, so that you do not give up on your retirement age.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.
Above all, keep increasing your financial literacy.

The Chernobyl nuclear accident occurred on the night of 26 April 1986.
12 areas in Ukraine and 23 per cent in Belarus were exposed to radiation pollution.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.
Recall, in July of this year, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree saying that a green corridor was opened for tourists in the Chernobyl area.
Also in the alien zone, the ban on shooting is lifted.
Previously, it has been reported that the CHAEC alienation zone has been opened to tourists from the Belarusian side.

What kind of club will take Paul Mamaev's liberated from the UDO?
Football player Pavel Mamaev, released last week from the UDO colony, will not return to the Krasnodar Football Club.
The former half-defendant of this club may soon sign a contract with the FC “Rostov”, reports the “Championate” portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the representatives of Rostov and Mamaev are now in the final stage.
The contract with a 31-year-old football player is expected to be signed for two years with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sports Express writes that the day before Paul Mamaev had to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dynamo, but the check was not due to an “undetermined situation in the club”.
Krasnodar cut off the deal with Mamaev last week on the agreement of the parties.
The half-defendant has been playing for the eloquent club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze twice in the Russian championship.
Earlier, Mamaev was in favour of Moscow's Torpedo and CSC.
From 2009 to 2016, Momaev played for the Russian Congress, with 15 matches.

A man with a samurai sword tried to stand in a garbage can.
A resident of the American city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after being attacked by a samurai sword against his opponent in a dispute over a trolley found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging into a dog of garbage near a deserted house.
This was observed by Todd Beavers, who went out for a walk in the evening.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black truck among the discards.
Miller saw Beaver's find and got upset.
He thought he could claim to be in a wheelchair, since he was the first to start digging in the trash.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bivers grabbed the truck and ran away with it to his house.
Then Miller took his samurai sword found in the same dog and began to pursue the opponent.
He caught up with Beaver around his house.
Miller grabbed the sword from the knives and started waving it towards the cart hijacker.
Bivers told Miller that it was recorded on video.
I noticed the video camera, and Miller ran away, but he threatened to come back.
Beaver left the truck in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman walking into his yard, and she took the truck, screaming insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving a car without rights.
The man was detained, charged with attempted murder.
In September it was reported that in the American city of Hardstone, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
He thus responded that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated at the same hotel where he had stopped, had not let him smoke.
Mass riots in the three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests is more markedly fragmented into individual fragments and loses political fulfillment.
The evidence of the very fact of “mass riots” does not support verification, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the matter down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the lifting of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will certainly leave behind the extreme irritation of the forces whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved futile.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances) - Alexei Minajlo was suddenly released from custody without any obligation, and a few hours later he was rehabilitated: the CRC dropped the charges.
Minajlo had been arrested for almost two months, and several professional communities had immediately joined him: historians, priests, writers.
Thereafter, there were only two accused of involvement in mass riots (presumably 13): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was subsequently arrested by the court until the end of December (he is also charged with violence against the representative of the government, article 318 of the Criminal Code).

It is noted that a criminal case has been brought against Bartecko under the first paragraph of the 82nd article of the country's Criminal Law, “Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Among the most famous are the seeds of dust.
The phytoestrogens are not bad and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer).
The known sources of plantoestrogens are all beans (most popular - soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
After all, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
The possible damage to such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, in the background of their intake, the development of hormones may be reduced by too many external analogues.

He's got a huge story, and he's got great sick people.
I wish them the best, and I believe that the city authorities will return their home club!"

The hydrometer center called faithful folklore
In Russia, there are many popular parties where people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometer Center, they've checked all the ideas that are supposed to work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can truly be trusted, in fact, in the short term.
According to the Russian hydromethyst, Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be a good day, as our ancestors have pointed out.
And if the sky is white, the next day there will be rains.
The second working observation is based on bird-watching.
They talk more about ribbons, if they're flying low, it's usually raining.
This is explained simply -- when the air is high, the mosquitoes are wetting their wings and the feather is forced to fall to hunt insects, says TASS.
On different continents, there are popular ideas.

Unknown oil stains have been found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
The oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches north-east of Brazil.
The pollution reservoirs were scattered over 2,000 kilometres of coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots discovered began on 2 September.
Every day, however, up to Thursday, the number of them, as well as the territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical and it's about crude oil.
In the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which had been transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it was stated that they did not correspond to the oil extracted from the mines in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It may be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it is in the ocean," said Brazil's G1 news portal, coordinator of the oil union of the Pernambucu States and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east, environmentalists found nine sea turtles fully covered with oil film.
And only two of them were able to save.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will start clearing contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute ' s experts recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil stains on the side and report on all the pollution found.

The Russians have no reason to postpone their retirement - V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have sufficient resources to fully earn the guaranteed pension product bill in the country.
The practice of increasing the pension by personal savings in the world is quite widespread.
It's another matter of how timely her introduction is.
“In my view, a large proportion of the population now have incomes, of which they simply have nothing to spend on increasing pension benefits in the future,” said V. Matvienko.
According to the Speaker, the Russians cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and accrual of the pension, since “constant changes in this area have made them definitively confused”.
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we have an obligation to do our utmost to ensure that pensions, the social security of citizens are improved.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible, taking into account national realities," said V. Matvienko, “RIA Novosti”.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (a guaranteed pension product) was to be developed, several basic principles, including voluntaryism, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings, must be provided.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September that a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP) should be agreed upon.
Among its main elements is the exclusively voluntary manner in which citizens join the savings system, guarantee the preservation of long-term pension savings by the State, registration of savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

In Congress, in a conversation between Trump and Zelensky, they found a "Russian trail"
In the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress, the RU was accused of involvement in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski.
The assumption that the story could somehow be followed by “Russian”, expressed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi, is transmitted by MSNBC News.
“I believe Russia has applied its hand to this,” said the Democrat, but did not comment further.
The leading Pelosi Democrats, who hold the majority in the Chamber, had previously announced the initiation of an impeachment procedure against the President.
This happened after Trump was complained to by an intelligence officer.
The informant suspected that in a conversation with Zelenski in July Trump put pressure on his interlocutor to bring a case against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Byden, the latter could become a competitor to Trump in the elections one year later.
The White House had to provide congressmen and the public with a transcript of a scandalous conversation.

The expert told me why you should give up tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada from McGill University found that more than ten billion microplastic particles fell into a cup when a bag of tea was brewed in five minutes.
Drinks can also be added to the packaged beverage, said the National News expert in the field of food security, Elizabeth Tikhov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Drinks don't drop at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"Moreover, the packages do not always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
She said it would be best to avoid using such a drink in favour of tea for a balance sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in the composition but also in the method of production - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, so that they could start releasing harmful substances.
“The best thing to do is to buy clean green or black tea, which will be the least of the supplements,” the expert said.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
On 27 September, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy, Andrey Kutepov, addressed a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, proposing to express his position on the initiatives taken by Federation actors to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Federation Economic Policy Council compiled information from the regions on its business development and legalization programmes and on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the development problems of SMEs and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, which has resulted in the lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes in general across the country by the business community in all areas of the senatorial visit”, said Andrej Kutepov.
In an annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions in the legalization of self-employment and a summary of regional data with proposals and issues (available to the editors).
In addition to the relevant ministries, aggregate data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," the senator said.
Lessons learned
Today, in many regions, small and medium-sized business support programmes have been adopted and are in place successfully.
For example, the Vologodsk Region has a Business Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In Ivanova region, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of one window through multi-functional centres.
In the Krasnodar region, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the marginal budget.
A cluster development centre is in operation in the Orlov region.
The Amur area under the federal project “Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators based on existing non-State co-king centres from the federal budget.
In a number of other regions, special support measures have been taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to be taken out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangel region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “business activities”, since this “is most consistent with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanov region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including the type of activities for the separation and repair of accommodation, construction and physical training.
The Bryana region considers it important to strengthen control of the malpractice producers of milk products through the Mercury veterinary system.
In the Kostrom and Magadan areas, the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and support for social entrepreneurship are advocated for by the legal and regulatory framework.
All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, said Andrej Kutepov.
The airline helped passengers avoid the neighborhood with crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new function: when booking seats on an airplane, it is now possible to find out where the young children will sit.
Now it is possible to avoid them if you wish to be with them.
Japanese Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of a new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.
The aircraft carrier has launched a function that allows children to identify their locations.
When choosing seats in the living room during the booking of tickets, passengers will be able to see a picture of the child’s head on the ground occupied by children between eight days and two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly alongside the little ones because of the possible discomfort associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline were thrilled by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and three crying children were sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested that “adult flights only” should be introduced, expressing a willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their movements because they did not see anything pleasant about flying alongside a crying child in a closed space.

Sanctioned shipments to Russia have fallen 100 times
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it has been estimated that agricultural and food supplies to Russia from countries that have fallen under the Russian food embargo have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to RF President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctioning countries in the first half of 2019 against 3 million 442.2,000 tons for a similar period of 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.
This is about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the quantities of products banned were compensated by increasing imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
It will be recalled that, by the end of August, the Government had prolonged until 31 December 2020 the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia under counter-sensions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The order on the destruction of the sanction initially applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined the list, from 1 January 2016 to Ukraine.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the smuggled “sanction” (products that fell under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food by any legal means.
As the sanctions of the West were maintained, the RF also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council to the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously referred to the “simply immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative impact on human education.
Moreover, Rosobnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of food fit for consumption in early June.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council to the President of the Russian Federation.
And RF Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeyev said it was wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how to use it by appointment, assessing quality.

Chile began building a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction of an E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) has officially begun this week, while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project is being developed.
Its total value is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, whose diameter will be about 40 feet [39 m].
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 metres in diameter, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's duplicates.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the dome has only been started, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years, since the publication of the first E-ELT plans.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about EUR 400 million, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Saffran Reosc.
