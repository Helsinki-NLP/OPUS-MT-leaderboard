To the large anti-intriguing protestors that began in October, Martelli replied with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes boisterous and ruddy, was because there were no elections, some of which had never been held since 2011.

The number of people who oppose Australia's becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people, which was conducted before the 2010 federal elections).
During the 2010 federal electoral campaign, Julia Guillard, who was doing the prime minister's duty, said that at the end of Queen Lizaveti's reign, Australia should become a republic.
They want Queen Lizaveta II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of those polled, who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent that, on the contrary, do not think that it should ever happen.

About the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos islands, a study published on Thursday in Science magazine.
According to a report by researchers from the University of Princeton, U.S.A., and U.S. University of Uppsala, Sweden, the evolution of the new species has only taken place in two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process requires more time. The emergence of a new species has become possible thanks to the crossing of an endemic Earthling Jurassic (Geospiza fortes) with a more unfathomable cactus law (Geospiza conirostris).
You can cast different shapes out of the gold, see if it's broken into thin sheets.
You can pull it out of a thin wire, which is then no problem twisting and clapping, and you can also chop it open or roll it into a letter.
It's something that you can make very thin and attach to a second metal, and it could be so subtle that it's sometimes used to de-decorate the illustrations in the books -- the so-called "sanctified manuscripts."
It's called the pH level of a certain chemical substance, and you can make this acid-based indicator yourself out of the juice of a reddish cabbage.
The color of the cell juice changes depending on the level of acidity or density of a certain substance.
The pH level in the chemical studied is determined based on the amount of ions in the water.
The water is a proton that has lost its electron (a single proton and one electron are known to form a waterfall atom).

You're using a companion when you call someone who's thousands of miles away.
In space a companion takes the call, after which almost instantly reflects it back.
The rocket has been used to send satellites to space, and scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere breaks down and the picture turns ugly.
In order for a telescope or a companion to get into space, you need a huge rocket that's over 100 feet high.
The car changed the world in an incredible way. A lot more light and rapid movement is what the circle did for us.
Because of that, we had trains, we had cars, and we had many other vehicles.
The lower the average size of the cats, the lower the average size, and the lower the average size, the lower the average size, they hunt both for rabbits and for deer.
In addition to all that, many small cats (including pets on a free walk) are caught and eaten by many small animals ‚Äî insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is that they each occupy their niche, i.e. they own their own function, so they don't have to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most social cats: they live in large troops known as gateways.
The Pride may include in its composition three adult males, who are kinsmen, as well as thirty females and children.
In most cases females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lions and packs of wolves or dogs is a lot like this, and the behavior of lions is very much like that of lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a grave danger to their prey.
Tiger is capable of climbing (but not so well), skip through long distances, swim and pull five times as hard as a long man, as a well-trained sportsman.
The tiger belongs to one group with lions, leopards and jaguars (a genus of panther). No other cat but these four can growl.
The roar of a tiger resembles a premonition that consists of harsh and resounding words rather than a eloquent roar of a lion.
Targets are used as food for small animals, and if they're able to do that, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes and birds, and almost all the animals on which they hunt are much smaller than the target.
Scientists believe that targets follow and find prey smelling through the scent, sniffing the trails on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they can see through the darkness, and they can move around very confidently, hunting prey, blending in with the environment, and hiding from the hiding places, attacking their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the population they come from (i.e. when moving through a river or a mountain mass or if such living things migrate to a new island, so going back to it will be rather difficult), they often end up in an environment which is much different from where they came from.
In this new environment other resources and competitors, so to become a strong competitor, a new population will need different features or adjustments compared to what it had before.
The original population has not changed at all, and as before, it still needs to adapt.
As a result, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, animals become less and less like the main population from which they separated.
It's going to be thousands or even millions of years and sooner or later these two populations are going to look to such a degree that no one will ever think of taking them to the same species.
This process, we call this re-creation, which really means the emergence of new species, and re-establishment is the inevitable result, and it's a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they also use the carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants are made from sunlight through photosynthesis and they also produce shades.
We build from the plants of the lady, and we make out of them, and we eat mostly of plants, and animals don't survive without plants, either.
And for some time, the mazzars were hunters, so they weren't afraid of anything or anything but mazzars.
His long jaws were decorated with more than 70 sharp, like a razor of teeth, and on the top of his mouth there was another extra advice, which meant that his extraction would never have been possible to escape.
It's not clear, but it's possible that he had a divided language, and the massacre was composed of large fish, shells, and other mazzars, and they could probably have used that as well as representatives of their species.
Besides, he was partial to everything that had gone into the water; his tray was not even worth a giant like the tyrant Rex.
Despite the fact that their food would not have been much of a surprise to us, individual dishes were, to say the least, unusual, including wild, seminal, snails and one of the rodents known as the nutritious sun.
And another difference was, when the poor people and the women ate in their chairs, the rich people would have banquets where they would eat and at the same time they would have compassion.
Foods that were produced in ancient Rome could not come into Europe from America or Asia later.
They didn't have, in particular, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, or whatever -- and I have to add, no ancient Romans ever had the opportunity to try turkey.
To each of his gods the inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple, which was considered his home.
The believers sacrificed their goddesses, and the priests tried to meet their needs by honouring them with various festivals and ceremonies.
At each temple there was his own open inner court and a lampstand where only priests could attend.
In some cases special pyramid-like towers were built in the construction of temples.
The peak of the tower was a special lighthouse dedicated to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house didn't matter much.

Greenland's territory wasn't densely populated, and when he believed the Scandinavian saga, Eric Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he swam west, he stumbled upon Greenland, which he called "Green Earth."
But the boundlessness of his discovery, the stains of Eskimos were already residing there at the time.
There were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was Scandinavian.
When you watched "The Treasure of the Nation," you might think there was a treasure map on the other side of the Declaration of Independence.
This does not match the facts, though, because something has been written on the other side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the other hand, said: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". Written by Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, the written record appears at the bottom of the document.
Whoever wrote it doesn't know exactly, but of course, that the big parchment document (29,3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) at the beginning of its existence was folded for preservation.
So it could quite be that they added this entry to it as a mere memory.
Thanks to the airfield in Normandy and the next battle, it was possible to liberate the north of France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
They were the French that made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On the 15th of August, 1940, the Dragoon operation began, with allies landing in southern France.
The Americans and the Forces of Free France freed up southern France in just two weeks and then headed for Germany.
Civilisation is the only culture that is quite a large group of people who work together and live in society.
The aforementioned term "civilisation" comes from a Latin word called civilis, i. e. "civil". The latter is similar to the Latin terms "civilis," or "civilis", or "civilis", or "city" or "city-state". In any case, it says something about the size of society.
Citizens' cities are forerunners of nations, and civil culture means generations of knowledge, equal distribution and sustainable cultural footprints.
Sometimes small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind.
During the war on independence the thirteen states initially established a weak central government according to the House on the establishment of a confederation of thirteen states. Only Congress was part of this government.
The introduction of data was without the authority of Congress, and since national executive and judicial power did not exist, he was counting on ensuring that all laws were implemented in support of state bodies that were often uncollected.
He also lacked the power to reverse state tax laws and tariffs.
According to the House of Consequences to Change, it was the unanimous consent of all the states that the states that were so unaware of the central government that their representatives were often absent.

Japan is located on nearly 7,000 islands, the largest island of Hansu, and Japan's biggest island, thanks to this, is now ranked 7th among the largest large islands in the world.
Japan is often called an archbishop in terms of geography, because it's a cluster or a group of islands.
Taiwan's history began back in the 15th century, and that's when it was written down by European sailors passing by as "Formosa" means "Beautiful Island".

The Match Picchu consists of three main objects: Incihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Room with three windows.
In order for tourists to have a better idea of what most of the buildings at the end of the complex looked like in the beginning, they were rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been renewed, and the restoration work had continued until now.
So the most popular picture format for real frames in the world is the 35 mm format, and we're talking about 35 mm film footage on the slope of the analog world.
This film is made now, but more importantly, the ratios of its width and height are now used in digital camera matrix formats.
This may sound a little crazy, but in fact the format is 35mm wide and has 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It's considered that the ratio of sides for this format (after dividing by twelve to get a simpler integer ratio) is 3:2.
The same or similar slopes have many common formats (e. g. APS families).
The rule of thirds, which is often subjected to attacks and ridicule, is simple advice that provides dynamism and at the same time preserves a certain degree of order in the image.
If you trust him, the best place to put the basic object is to cross the lines that divide the photograph into vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see an example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, had an urgent focus on it.
With all the language and cultural differences taking place, Christian religion has united European countries for over a thousand years.
Everyone, from king to ruler, was in its all-progressive power.
The essence of one of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth needs to be used to reduce the size of the branch and to alleviate the suffering, and that's exactly what the church's money is for.
For over a thousand years, central church authorities have been in Rome, and because of that concentration of power and money, many are wondering if this doctrine is being implemented.
The United Kingdom initiated the German naval blockade shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital goods of war and civil origin even though it violated universally recognized international law that, over the last two centuries, it has been anchored at the final level by several international agreements, but it has proved to be an effective strategy.
Britain has traded international waters so that ships cannot make it into certain parts of the ocean, so it has put even neutral ships at risk.
Due to the fact that there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany believed that she would not be engaged in unlimited underwater warfare, either.
Among the majority of citizens and countries, in the 1920s, there was a predominance of the moods of pacifism and individualism.

In ancient China, there were unique ways in which we could define different ages, and at every stage of China's history, or in every family in power, there were great dynasties.
In addition, the dynasty's reigns were divided over periods of divided provinces, when there was a instability, and the best known was the three Kingdoms' era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During the periods mentioned above, many of the court-martials who fought for the throne led to brutal hostilities.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history was the Three Kingdoms era: thousands of people died fighting to take the highest place in the great palace in Zion.
The French Revolution has had many social and political consequences. Among them is the transition from absoluteism to the republican system of administration, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not to a single ruler, but to the entire nation.
In addition, various positions after the Revolution became available to all male candidates, resulting in the most successful and ambitious.
The same thing happened in the Army because when military titles were taken from the verb before, it's based on skills.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French revolution to start their own revolutions.
Magamette was deeply interested in questions that went beyond worldly life, and in order to do meditation and think through it, he often visited a cavern in Mount Noor, which is known as Hira.
The very Friday that has endured the trial sometimes gives a very bright idea of the spiritual standing of Magamette.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world- -it's on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very hard to find out who it is, but inside the cave you're in full isolation.
You can't see a thing from the caves very little of the world up there, and you can see it from the caves very little.
Heops is the only one of the seven marvels in the world that has been preserved until now.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the poor Pharaoh, and it was built in the third century BC.
On the plateau of Giza, also known as the Necropal of Giza, in the Valley of Death in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a series of smaller graves, several temples and a great Sphinx.
The building of the Great Pyramid was devoted to the memory of Pharaoh Heops, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were devoted to the wife and family of Pharaoh.
The sign that represents the upward movement of the bow looks like a "V" and the lower part it looks like a brace or a square without the bottom side.
"The bow bow upwards" means that you have to start at the end of the bow and lead them up, and you have to start at the top of the bow (that's where your hand holds the bow) and lead the bow downwards.
The upward movement usually makes the bow more softer, and down makes it more strong and secure.
You can put your badges on the pencil, but remember that printed character loops stand there not just for a certain musical reason but for a certain musical reason, so normally you need to keep them.
On October 6, 1789, because of a crowd of women from the market, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, their two little children (the four-year-old Louis-Charles and the 11-year-old Mary Tereza) and Madame Lizavette, the King's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family in a brougham was taken to Paris, and along the way their neighborhoods were swarmed with people who were whistling, murmuring, and shouting threats to the king and the queen.
The King and Queen must have opened the windows of the carriage under the influence of a crowd.
At some point a man of a crowd waved before the Queen, who was still frightened to death, his head slain in Versailles by a guard.
The military expenses of the U.S. imperialists in connection with the Philippine invasion had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were posted through the Wall Street Banks on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay the tax to the colonial regime of the United States.
Undoubtedly, a major achievement by the imperialists of the United States would be the extravagant gains that have resulted in the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.

The early Middle Ages, followed by the classical Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, and the latter by the Middle Ages. The latter was estimated to have ended at about 1500.
Within the term "technological determinism" they mean a whole range of practical ideas, by pressing for the purpose of promoting certain technologies or technical need to understand precisely that human destiny is based on the logic behind scientific laws and their identity in the field of technology.
Two common ideas characterize most of the explanations of technological determinism: the very development of technology goes beyond cultural or political influences, and technology, in turn, only affects society (not socially understood).
In particular, there is a belief that car use stimulates road development.
However, when the number of cars is small, the overall network of cars makes no sense, and that's why we're developing new ways of making it possible to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Because car owners are increasing the number of road accidents, this, in turn, leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health which allow for the treatment of different injuries.
A huge part of cultural determinantism, influenced by the works of writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of romanticism.
When it came to the Romantic era, people were deeply influenced by the geography of the presence, and traditions and the culture associated with it developed over time, and they were better off than the laws freely introduced because they existed in harmony with the place and the position that took place.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the capital of Europe's fashion in feudal times.
In 400 C.E., the city acquires a reputation for being a luxury epicenter and retains this status until nearly 1100 C.E.
During the 12th century, his status as a stool would deplete the cloud, and this was due mainly to the fact that the crossword puzzles with gifts, including sharp spices and silk, had returned, and they were valued much higher than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
That's when Constantinople gave up a title for Paris's capital.
The Gothic style bloomed in between 10 and 11 years, as well as 14 years.
At first, an early Byzantine culture had a strong influence on the style of dress.
But Western styles can take 25 to 30 years because of the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages, and people from the Crusades began to use buttons to seal their clothes up, which was one of the biggest events of that time.
In the natural farm, you produce this amount of food that only provides for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture is basically an organic system, and it's based on the use of its own ecological region of saved seeds combined with sevocatives or other non-complicated methods, and the goal is to get the most out of it.
Many of the farmers historically run a natural rural farm, and many of the third world countries are still practicing it.
Subcultures bring people together in ways that are socialized and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and (or) gender representatives can be characterized by subculture.
Individual subculture can take place on the basis of different factors such as language, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or their combinations.
Members of the same subculture often determine their belongings to it through a prominent and symbolic style in dress, manners, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, an example is most often set for children who have not been fortunate enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, neglect, mistreatment and resentment and who have not been socialized as a child.
Some of these children are called "wild." Some of the "wild" children have been in prison for a long time (usually their own parents have been involved); in isolated cases, the absence of parental care was a result of parents' reluctance to notice serious physical or intellectual disturbances and defects in the baby.
Before they were left or fled, alien children could have had serious accidents or been traumatized.
Others, as if, raised by animals; by rumor, some lived by themselves in the wild.
If a child was fully raised by animals, his behavior almost everywhere (including physical limitations) reflects the behavior of an animal-engineered animal: for example, such a child may be afraid of humans or be indifferent to them.
While the purpose of project learning is to make the learning process more easy and interesting, Scofielding goes even further.
Scaulding isn't about teaching, it's about helping people learn a new skill, it's about using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual, for example, assistants as well as teachers and a small handpick at Microsoft Office.
There are supposed to be virtual assistants in software, and they need to be able to ask questions, give advice, and explain the procedures with which a student or a listener can easily handle himself.
There are many reasons why children can end up as foster parents, and that can be both difficult walking around, carelessness, and even coercion.
You can't allow children to grow up in environments where nobody cares about them and they're not raised or educated, but that's what happens.
We think the foster system is a secure place for children like this.
It's estimated that thanks to our foster families' system, they're going to have reliable medical services, safe houses, good and caring educators and stable education.
They think that an acceptable family should provide for all the needs of a child who has not been served in the house since he was taken away.
The Internet is a tool not only of mass communication but also of communication between individuals.
Thanks to a special feature of the Internet, complementary opportunities are there to use it and to meet the needs of the audience.
So for example, it's suggested that concepts like "education" and "socialization" are hard motives for using the Internet. (James et al., 1995)
The terms "personal participation" and "permanent relations" were also defined by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in a survey of audience reactions to the Internet.
Because of the video recording important discoveries were made in the explanation of microexpressions- -they're meant to mean moving the muscles of the face that lasted just a few milliseconds.
It is argued that the proper handling of microscopic expressions can help you determine whether to lie to a person or to tell the truth.
Oliver Sachs, in his work, pointed to the image of people with brain damage, without understanding what they were saying, but they could actually rate their sincerity.
He even assumes that animals, such as pets, can also be properly interpreted into human behavior.
The results of the 20th century study reveal that there are two genetic diversity funds, namely, visible and hidden variations.
Mutations cause new genetic variations, and by selecting them they are removed from the pool.
And every next generation, segregation and recombination are shifting the variation in those two pools.
In hiding, available plant resources are unable to meet the need for primates in amino acids, when their digestive system is human-like.
Moreover, when they fail, the consequences are serious -- both malnutrition and depression, and imminent death.
The most available plant resources would be proteins, which can be found in grandmother's notes and sheets, but if they're not properly prepared, then organisms like us will have a hard time adopting them.
On the contrary, food of animal origin ( ants, termites, eggs) provides an organism with a large amount of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids, and at the same time is easily adopted.
And it's not surprising, to say the least, to find out that our ancestors solved their own "white problem" almost the same way that chimpanzees do now.
By interrupting sleep, it means deliberately waking up a person's sleep during the ordinary sleep process and falling asleep again after a short period of time (between 10 and 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you have to move the clock to sleep, try moving it to the other end of the room.
And according to the other biorrhythmias, before you go to sleep, you have to consume a lot of fluid (first of all, water or tea, known as marshmallows) that makes you get up at night to struggle.
The inner calm of a man is inversely proportional to the straining of his body and spirit.
There is more to life than there is to life, and there is an absolute peace and contentment available to all.
Enlightenment can reach anyone. The only obstacle to this is our own negativity and tension.
The basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the Buddha's teaching, which was complemented by the way of love machinated and a series of methods of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it combines meditation, Kundalini Yoga, and love for all humanity.
Kundalian yoga followers argue that in order to wake up Kundalini's energy (the energy of enlightenment), you need to practice certain yoga, mantra, and visualization poses, as well as perform breathing exercises.
God's ego is the primary part of Tibetan meditation, and the visualization of different gods allows you to clean up power channels, open chakras, and gain enlightenment.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated.
Two years after the end of the war, the Cold War, the former allies, they turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really fought for the armies of friendly countries, and the fields of battle were in different regions, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Polish protection was broken down by September 17, 1939. The retreat and regrouping along Romanian positions were the only hope.
However, in just one night those plans made no sense, because more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army, in the form of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, entered into the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Rio Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Pact on non-aggression and other two-part and multi-.. international agreements.
Ship's freight is obviously the most effective way of transporting people and goods through the oceans.
The traditional task of naval forces was that their country would be able to outperform people and goods, and at the same time the employee would not be able to outrun his own people and his own goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most important examples of this idea, and in order to help the United States, Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop that movement, using submarines in a major way.
Germany would probably have conquered Britain the same way it would have conquered the rest of Europe if the allies had failed.
It looks like the first time the goats were in use in the Iranian mountains of Zahros about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to divorce them so that they could always have milk, hair, meat, and skin under their hands.
Usually, the goats were grown in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures. They were often cared for by fa√ßades, children or teenagers. The latter were shepherds. Thus, today the animals are fed.
By the 16th century, heavy roads had been built in England.
Though busy roads and represented only the parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses to move at a higher speed and to carry the goods with a greater weight than the available unequal roads.
The stoves became used to keep the rivers on the spot pretty early, but after a while it became clear that the movement along the rivers would be more effective when they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice had become expanded, but due to the presence of iron-wooded wagons had rather worn out.
In a little while, the iron wheels came in, and the first complete metal-made river appeared in 1767.
The first known means of moving around was walking, and two million years ago, with the appearance of a Homo erectus, which means "missing person," people started walking in vertical position.
The Australians, their predecessors, usually didn't.
The missing features of austra-lapitects are found in fossils that are 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, but it's possible that seven million years ago Sahelanthrope was already walking on two legs.
You can look more consciously at the environment, you can become a participant in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that the sufferings mentioned in the future don't get very strong.
It often looks more like a symptomatic cure, but if we need more than a temporary solution, we need to find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It's quite obvious that thanks to the technological and scientific achievements of humanity, the world has changed considerably, and as a result of the overcrowding and wasteful order of life, people have grown.
After the declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy of it signed by Congress President John Hankok and Secretary Charles Thomson was delivered to John Dunlap's printery, which was located in a few blocks away.
During the night, it was made from 150 to 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap Sheet.
On July 8, Johnson Nixon first read the paper publicly at the Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington got one of the copies that he had read in his army in New York on July 9. Another copy came in London on August 10.
There are 25 first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (also known as the Dunlap Broadsides). The original manuscript was not saved.
Many of the people in modern Polynesia believe that a single group of dinosaurs have survived and that they even exist, only we call them birds.
Because of the feathers and the ability to fly, many people don't think they're dinosaurs.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs, and like the tyrant Rex, walk on their two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers are doing operations with the coded binary of information.
Two digits can only consist of a two-digit number, zero or one, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (on a computer) bit.
Internal abuse may not have obvious signs, for example redness is a fairly general symptom that makes it impossible to diagnose immediately.
The first thing you need to know about internal abuse is that you can have an open capacity for pills or taxi home chemicals.
Instructions on granting urgent medical attention to this particular poison should be considered on the label.
To define this group of insect entomology, they use the term "club" in a formal sense.
That deadline came because people had long known that they were bedbugs -- insects that were most adapted to human paradisaics.
Both kisses and bedbugs are nesting parasites; they are accustomed to living in their nests or in their master's house.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (RS) are registered in the United States, and this seems to be a neurological disease, mainly among adults of young and middle age.
Sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, and then it includes the main brain and the spinal cord as well as the optic nerve.
According to the study, it was found that women are twice as likely to suffer from RS.
A couple may conclude that the infant's upbringing does not match their interest or interest in the child that they already have.
A couple like that can give their baby up for adoption.
At the adoption of the native parents the children denied their parental rights to grow up and raise it could have been other female children.
The main purpose of science is to discover through scientific methods the way the world works. In fact, most scientific research is done using this method.
There is one, however, not just him; the experiment (it's a test that's going on to rule out one or more possible hypotheses with questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
The main thing that the philosophers and naturalists paid attention to was the classical text, which is the Latin version of the Bible.
Generalized views were then considered by the Aristocrat to be on all scientific issues, including psychology.
When the number of people in Greek decreased, the West became torn away from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorrhythmias that can be observed in animal behavior and physiology depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles, the latter being the result of a biological clock.
In most living creatures, including bacteria, mushrooms, plants and animals, periodic rhythms have been fixed that are not direct reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process. Even if the signal is not coming from the outside, the process is still running as independent cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that stated that DNA is a genetic material was tested in the Hershey and Chase experiments.
So for the implantation of her own DNA in Hershey and Chase's bacteria, they used phages or viruses.
They did two experiments in the course of which radioactive phosphorous denoted the bacteria ‚Äô DNA, or radioactive serum, the protein of the bacterium.
Depending on the type of mutation that happened with the genetic material, mutation, whether or not cells are affected by the fertilising line, mutations can have a variety of consequences.
Inheritances can only be mutations in embryonic cells; other mutations can result in the loss of cells or cancer.
Ecotourism attract those people who are interested in visiting different natural zones and territories because they want to enjoy the common species and the landscape, including flora and fauna.
As an example of what can be done in nature, you can bring fishing, hunting, bird watching, parks visit and explore ecosystems.
You can give an example a visit, study, and photograph of an orangutans on Barney Island.
People go out on their cars every morning with little provincial cities to go to work, and other people who work there come by, and they just left.
In this dynamic transport environment, everyone has to do with, and support, private transport cars.
Scientific evidence suggests that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to human evolution over the last two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who are taking part in society and most of them aren't happy about it.
In developed countries you'll hardly hear so many complaints about the fall of an artist or the quality of the water.
Why are transport systems a constant source of similar complaints why do they stop working regularly?
The concept of "transport movement" implies analysing the movement of individual drivers and modes of transport between two points, as well as exploring how they interact.
Unfortunately, learning transport flows is a difficult problem because it is not possible to predict for a reason the behaviour of drivers.
And fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently, so in general, transport flows are characterized by a kind of rationally defined sequence and can be described roughly using mathematical models.
To show more complete and qualitatively what the movement of the means of transport is, it was established as bound by the three main parameters: (1) stream, (2) density, and (3) speed.
It's really helpful to design and design road objects as well as to carry out their operations.
The first animals in the air are insects, and flying ability has helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases insect wings fold along the body.
Because of this they can kill themselves in different very little places to hide there from the predators.
Strangers and dream flies are the only insects that can't fold wings nowadays.
One person, Aristarchus, said a few thousand years ago that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but a lot of people thought that the solar system (including the sun and other stars) revolved around the earth.
That sounds reasonable, because being on Earth, it's hard to say that it's moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River is second in length to the Earth, among all the other rivers, and it's the largest river, and it's 8 times as large in volume as it is in a hand that takes second place.
The widest cancer on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its breadth reaches six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's river.
The Amazon River, which contains thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 miles (3980 miles) long.
Although the building of a pyramid using a stone continued until the end of the Age of Old Kingdom, in size and technical perfection of the building, no one could ever get over the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by their ancestral monuments, which at that moment exceeded a thousand years.
It's the smallest independent country in the world, with the smallest population.
In contention and official messages the Vatican uses Italian.
Most of those in the public sector use Italian as a day-to-day language, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are part of the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that the basic chemical elements (e.g. gold, silver, and copper) meet in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to obtain by way of notable tools, people knew about them in ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotel suggested a theory that claimed that one element or a mixture of several elements (earth, water, fire and air) was part of all things.
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, water, gas-like and plasma, though, according to his theory, they can transform into other things to become what we're observing.
In most cases the alloy is composed of two or more metals. Please note that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are treated as metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that have a small number of non-metallic components, such as carbon.
Everything about matter is made up of everything in the Universe, and then there's all that matter made up of tiny particles, atoms.
The size of the atoms is so small that at the end of this saying they're placed trillions.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and the frequency of its use decreased as new writing methods appeared.
People are still texting on the screens, and nobody needs a stick.
We can only guess what kind of fate will hit the keyboard when something fundamentally new comes to it.
The principle of a plutonium bomb is that we use nuclear synthesis to form a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling uphill a very heavy cart, and if you redistribute the core, it'll free up a fraction of that energy.
The cores of some atoms are unstable, which means they're prone to disintegrate with or without a slight external impact.
The moon's surface is composed of stones and dust.
The bark‚Äôs thickness is about 70 km [70 km] and its thickness is about 100 km [100 km] on the far side.
The moon's crust is thinner than the moon's moon's moon's monthly dreams, and under its height it's thicker.
The monthly seas may be more on the nearest side of the month, because here's the thinner bark, and accordingly the lava was easier to climb on the surface.
And the main thing about content is that it's people who run it or who they're invited to it.
These theories come from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires that they turn into internal ones and that they provide an subjective character (or, say, internalize) during their lifetime.
So these theories say that it's what makes people want what they do, and what the factors in their environment might affect whether they're going to do certain things.
The Maslov's and Hertzberg's "Two Factor Theory of Needs" represent two authoritative substantive theories.
In fact, when managers designate their former colleagues, two types of behavior may arise, and at one end of the spectrum, they will try to remain their own boyfriends (or their own girlfriend).
A manager of this type may have trouble assessing performance, making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, taking responsibility, and being held accountable.
Another extreme is the situation where someone changes to the unrecognizable -- they feel the need to change everything that the team has done before and to assign it to themselves.
And in the end, it's the leader who is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This kind of behavior often ends in a fight between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Standard perfection standards for normal commands must be followed by virtual commands, but there are small differences.
Usually, the virtual members of the command run the role of a contact centre for a relevant real group.
Given that such teams can meet independently of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understood by the local leadership.
Another unique component of the distributed virtual command is the existence of a real "visible command" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The management team that each member of this group is supposed to be called "unknown command". It sets the standards for each member.
What's the reason why an organization can't wish to go through a lengthy process of training an educational organization?
Creativity and intimacy can be detected when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organization.
Thus, a process used by an organization where employees work together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that meets clients' needs.
The organization's guides should create a culture for which knowledge-sharing and organizational learning are characterized. Only then can an organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuous approach is a method by which organisations can achieve greater efficiency.
The theoretical approach to learning is underpinned by physical evidence in the form of neuralological data. Thus, the area of research narrows down and becomes more accurate.
The findings of the research that scientists have obtained are confirmed by the close relationship between brain pathology and human behavior.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, occipital damage, formations, blisters, pathological changes, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter some mental function.
Developing new technologies makes it possible to explore the structure of the brain and the processes that we don't know in it.
Because of that, we get a huge amount of stuff and data to build simulation models that, in turn, help us understand the processes that are happening in our minds.
Although usually the term "artificial intelligence" and it causes science fiction associations, AI is actually a very important area of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the area of artificial intelligence involves trying to get machines to automate jobs that you need to do in order for cars to behave wisely.
As an example, you can design and control your ability to respond to queries and technical concerns from clients as well as identify faces, voices, and background.
They've gone into individual disciplines that study real life's problems and offer solutions for them.
Nowadays AI is often used in economics, medicine, technology and war areas, and it's also a software component for some computer programs and video games.
The guided tours are a large part of school education, and the teacher often takes the students to places where the bus can't be reached.
Modern technology allows you to organize virtual excursions. Students can learn about museum exhibits, visit the aquarium, or enjoy the beauty of art.
A collaborative part of virtual excursions also represents a very good way to explore the journey and share an experience in the future.
Bennet School students in North Korea, for example, design a website about their travel to the state capital every year and process it every year, but the album has old versions.
Besides, blog management can improve students' written language, although the introduction of grammar and spelling in their language can generally be better off because of the audience's presence.
Considering that students are usually the most annoying audience and the author of the blog to avoid criticism, he is doing his best to improve his style.
Besides, blogging helps students to understand the world better around them, and we need to maintain the audience's interest in them and make them more capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Bloging contributes to collaboration and stimulates students to learn a lot more than traditional schooling offers.
If scientists are to use blogs properly, they "will be able to develop the skills of analytics and critical thinking; an active response to Internet material will help students create their own position on other people, as well as to express their own views on individual issues". (Robot, 2002)
The Atom is a fascinating and charming two-lingual capital in Canada. It has many art galleries and museums that provide an opportunity to explore the past and the present.
The Niagara Falls lie far farther south, and in the north is the lake of Muscok, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
That's why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners think of Antoria as a typical Canadian province.
In much of its territory, which is farther north, lives quite a few people, and some generally imagine themselves to be almost the deserted desert.
The following thing that surprises people in this world is the number of African-Americans in the United States- -exceeding the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located off the coast of Africa and are part of the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar, of course, is the largest one, and we can compare Madagascar with a continent in terms of wildlife.
They're almost all smaller islands, or independent states, or in France, and they're famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and to the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco to Gamma had found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, it related to the beginning of European influence and colonialism policies.
The northern limit of the region is Sahel, and the southern border is the Atlantic.
Women: it's always recommended that a female tourist say that they're married, even if they're not.
Besides, it may prove useful to wear a ring (so it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they can be confronted with behavior that suits them, that locals can often harass tourists, grab hands, and so on.
Discreetly deny men and bravely hold back your opinion (in spite of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!)
The modern Casablanca 10th century B.C. was founded by the Berber fishermen, and the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenides used this city as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca. They left it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and called it Dara L-Badz.
All over Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping places.
In the Old Town of Medina, you can quickly find places where traditional Moroccan products are traded ‚Äî leather, pottery, tadjins, Collian and various toys, but they are all designed for tourists only.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo just outside the border of Rwanda that enjoys popular tourism.
In 2002, Goma washed lava out of the face of the Niirang volcano, where she buried most of the city's streets, mostly in the middle of the city.
In spite of the fact that Gom's city itself is safe enough to go beyond that city, it is important to conduct a small investigation to see if there is a point where hostilities are taking place in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city also acts as a base for climbing a volcano in Niirogong. It also offers very cheap mountain-gull watchers services, which is more attractive to find in Africa.
The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the comparative absence of Tombuktu his name began to be used as a metaphor for defining distant exotic places.
Despite the reputation of tourism and the presence of an airport, Timbuktu today is the city where it takes place.
In 1990, because of a threat to the sands of the desert, it was introduced into the list of objects of a world heritage that threatens to threaten.
Henry Lewis Gates paid a lot of attention to this city from the African Continent's PBS Channel.
It's even more pronounced than any other city in the world, because it has more Arabic than African style.
Krueger National Park (NPC) is located in the northeast of South Africa. Its eastern border is Mozambique, north is Zimbabwe, and its southern border is Crocodile.
The park has a total area of 19,500 km2. It has 14 ecosystems, each of which has different animals and plants.
He is one of the most interesting places in the country, and he is considered to be the most important of South Africa's National Parks.
As in all the national parks of the South African Republic, in the park every day they pay for their entrance fees and they extort from the visitors' ecological gathering.
In addition, it may be useful to buy a so-called Wild Card, which gives you the right to visit several South Africa parks or all South Africa‚Äôs national parks.
The name of Hong Kong is being borrowed from Hong Kong, which is the center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings, which form the city's architectural face, are likened to a shiny bar chart, and Victoria's harbors only highlight her presence.
The best species for Hong Kong are the ones to enjoy when you leave the island and head for the opposite of the Cove.
A large part of Hong Kong's urban area is located comparatively along the northern coast of the Dried Lands.
In the past, it's been colonized by colonists from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of colonial history, it's from here that you have to start.
The Sundarban Forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, and it extends 80 km (50 km) from the coast of Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO has announced a World Heritage site called the National Park Sundarban, which is the part of the forest that is located in India.
Not only the mangrove swamps are called the woods, it is and some of the last deaf jungles that once covered the plains of Ganges and are still preserved.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which nearly one third are occupied by water and/or swamps.
Les Sundarban, of 1966, was a storyteller of the living world, and now, according to reports, 400 royal Bengali tigers and some 30,000 spotted deers are in this region.
From the inter-urban motorcade (which is behind the cancer) buses are sent all day long. However, in most cases they leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and Jakarra (which is in Bumtang district).
Due to the fact that interurban buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy tickets a couple of days before the trip.
The handy and reliable little buses of Coaster Japan's production support most of the region.
A taxi route is a comfortable and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as Punakho (200 ngultrums) and Paro (150 ngultrums).
The bridge that was crossed through Aiapoque is a vantiva, and it connects the banks of the Ayapoque, where two cities were scattered -- Ayapoki, Brazil, and St. George's de Luapok, French Guiana.
The height of two pylons is 83 metres. The length of the bridge is 378 metres. The clear part consists of two strips, each measuring 3.50 m.
The vertical light under the bridge is 15 meters high. The bridge was opened only in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
The bridge will become fully operational in September 2017, after Brazilian customs checkpoints have been completed.
The Guaran√≠, which led the lives of half-navigating hunters and also engaged in natural farming, were the largest group of indigenous inhabitants living in the modern-day Eastern Paris area.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Pucans and Guayaquira, lived in Chuck's region, but to survive, they were hunting, fishing and gathering.
Prague, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of India," actually came into existence in the 16th century when Spanish invaders met with indigenous peoples.
The Spanish started the colonization period of three hundred years.
The railway was able to maintain its identity and identity since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
And the great thing about Argentine is, there's one of the best teams and gender players in the world.
