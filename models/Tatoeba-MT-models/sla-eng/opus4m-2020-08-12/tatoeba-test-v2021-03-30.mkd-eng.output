It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're getting cold.
We're walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not taking advantage of Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's get them fired.
What's it worth?
Our water was dead.
Tom pretended not to notice Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He probably still has it.
She looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is between seven and nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves have stalked the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay his rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun yet?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
Who did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom knows he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom got a little yellow in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would've answered the question.
I have a duty to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit his gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be impertinent with me.
I think you did it.
We're not born of monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually have for lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever considered quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big of a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop abusing Tom.
What could possibly go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping me?
Are you two related?
He likes ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom, I wrote this report.
Do you buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We better not go out on a storm like this.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose leaks every time I'm cold.
We've met several times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way you'll understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still had the price on it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was an emergency.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
You don't make a man with a scalp.
She tried.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want a turnip.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
A messenger's worth a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You guessed one thing.
Macedonian has four verbic ways: pronounced, conditional, commanded and transfused.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her lines as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you for a second, Tom?
These pants are right.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we be helping him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you don't sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard's big.
It's a children's game.
Tom, you're not mad.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom's driving me to hell.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd love to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a good stand scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trailer.
Who do you have on your list?
He's got a very good alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I come with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Make sure you don't get stuck in the mud bar.
They were both coughing.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want some tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the final day they'll try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got to tear down the room.
There are no survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on his face.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom doesn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king found it particularly difficult to give talks because of a severe speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than then to escape.
He's licking himself.
Who are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's being reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Let's take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is lame.
We're broke.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just give me a little help?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The power heater warms the ceramic tiles off the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the trees.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'm going to summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand him.
He's got his sleeve on.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's sinking.
The pipes are jammed.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They were squatting next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom told everyone by mistake that I had died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was nice.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anybody care?
How is that your fault?
Tom got a beer out of a bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are falling apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
Here's my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running through the gutter.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard is really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to leave.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he hoped for.
I just fired them.
That was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as you can.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he'd remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong for me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Karito powder is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a rough night for me.
Tom was driving around the city with a brake up his ass without even noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to shut Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unjustly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I got robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make noise.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate terms.
Your coffee's infuriating!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big meraclia for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom writes skillfully.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan didn't feel safe in his own home anymore.
Tom already told me.
They have to let go of the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes sparked with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom's running to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "So do I."
There's a lot of birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom is richer than we thought.
I never intended to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a couple of people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
Apologize.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard-wings, butterflies, and roaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom tore his knee.
Where do the pinions come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking a turkey with a light bulb.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let's make it happen.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm crippled.
Tom arrived earlier.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He always wrestles with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticking.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What good does that do?
That's very helpful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I've decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do his job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room's full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open her head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your pretty eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems like a fun guy.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was sick, and she's suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and I can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, get better.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a depraved dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the sachet to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to be helping them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
I want you to bring them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom got his eyes lighted when Mary stepped in the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, this is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they are one year old, so they eat them.
Could you pull this arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that?

We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't think so.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
This book weighs.
Why should we find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Did you get scared?

There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.

I just don't want you to do something you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We've set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.

Should we wait here for her?
You come out so naked, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.

We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?

I should have been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.

Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her laziness.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm taking my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often spoke of.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have any pens.
When should we start worrying?
I've been thinking about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk in vain.
Did you buy the cure?
Was Tom drinking?
I'm in a lot of pain.
The question is, who's gonna do it?
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everybody happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me what happened.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom is a wunderkind.
He's walking to school.
It's starting to get in our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very conceited.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth of 56 runners.
Don't make noise.
Do you trust Tom now?

I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.

Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never see you at that club.

Is he looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom's not answering.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are in danger.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to see her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We heard carefully so that we would not miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make up for it.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he has a few beers.
You have kind eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, well, it's gonna get better... when the willows give birth to grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when does it have fireworks?
Tom could be lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair's falling off.

Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?

Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
What are you guys talking about?
Hold on to my luck!
The concert is over with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Hold on a second.
I have something to deal with.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's enough air here.
She married zero of a man.
The wind's gone down.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything rusty.
The old man fell before he died.
I don't like this book.
Lucky I hit him.
What would Tom want that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got the symphony.
Can someone help me?
We'll leave this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to a hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm doing.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
The one who can hear butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They pulled a lot to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be much more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just got off work.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, warm it in the microwave.
The stream is to the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw him.
Tom's knocking a little bit.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How is the cylinder volume found?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he was drinking.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the doorknob.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a kind of mammal.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems pretty shaken up.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's about to roll.
This will greatly facilitate our work.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not restored.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm really good at that.
Does it hurt so much?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get even colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the pilgrim.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest look.
I've been sick for two days.
This hose is a waste, it's too thin.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Getting out of this rain is out of the question.
I'll have them leave right away.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an assal.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's no problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was hitting Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like watching lesbian porn.
And who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
He's writing a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to swim the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This theme is taboo.
We barely made it out.
Did they hire you?
Fluid gas.
Tom could see Mary was texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people feel that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Dude, you can't just walk up to a woman and scratch her -- that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's been detoured.
You can't do what you think.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He blew a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was milky.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was quiet.
The hull of the ship is divided into more watertight parts.
Since you were cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Let's not!"
He's not the shy guy he was anymore.
You get it?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to make him help.
We've got a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very easy to understand.
There were boys in groups everywhere, some playing jammies, some playing tiles, some with a ball, others riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is sweet of any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I was just having breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from the inside.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You hit your head.
We're gone.
Get back to your seat.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I'm not finding the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spiced food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't figure out who wants the baby because it's pointing both ways.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is real love.
Can you look at me?
Though he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Can you fix the bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handcuffed?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a silk on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing just fine.
She can't read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I made a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail someday.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you made a list of things to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
The milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does it cost over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
Which country is Boston?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was having pneumonia, I was just mowing into my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me now.
My cat's happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
That's right.
Tom has a headache.
I don't think so.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom doesn't listen.
They want everything you've told them you're gonna give it to them right now.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What did you decide?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never want you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it would be best if you called them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do with this?
Is he barking at your dog?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts.
We were 18 years old.
I make 13 bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate carnations.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Go on with it.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They've drunk you.
Tom started complaining.
I think you should pick her.
Behave yourself.
You're gorgeous.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom took a hard look at Mary.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not getting any worse.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've had worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I've only had one glass.
No one's texting me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone's in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What did you do last?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They're setting us up.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look anything like his dad.
Tom's not exactly crippled.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, he was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get in trouble.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine fun like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom made his toast with butter.
We've got work to do.
I heard him snort.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on the hill.
I'll accept what's happened.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed accustomed to such problems.
You're gonna be okay.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the flies.
He rarely went there.
Tom's stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if at all possible.
It's been an arena day.
I've got some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome your weakness.
How many push-ups do you take a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was rooted in alcohol.
Tom's healing.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is heavy.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish the project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me pick you up, Tom.
He won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You're disgusting.
Everyone was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe he's acting weird.
No one can be saved from death.
That's not gonna help.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble a lot of times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that all we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earaches.
Dan got hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time right now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom got famous.
It's stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom up to?
My mother's advice would exceed my friend's.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's freaking out.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.

What a beautiful view!

What else did you expect?

This is hard for her.
Mary put lipstick on her.
She's got a picture.
He's swimming.
The flowers are wriggling.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeb, right now!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don’t thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
Nobody wants to sit with you?
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.

Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.

She's complex.
Check if the gas is off.
Would you be involved in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the tub.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.

I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, quite by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It is difficult to understand self - injury if you have never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can Myrtle Be Used in Food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them back?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's very angry.
What kind of situations would you use it in?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom's groaning.
Get Tom's gun.
Look back.

I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Did you find anyone to babysit the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was after the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom's giggling out loud.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I won't say anything.
It would be good.

That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom, think about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.

I've seen him in person.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.

It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.

You're below his level.
I feel like I'm early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, air the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me meet Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't be longer than five minutes.
If the time was running, the radioactivity was shrinking.
Should we believe that?
Why are you dressed up like that?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one else has done anything else.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thanks for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
I've got him.
That gave me an idea.
The fed from the watch broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, come on.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Kids need love.
That's his business.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom doesn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to watch the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's have a sled.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many gallons of oil does he put in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This is green.
Tom regretted what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom's upset.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom, you scratched your hair.
They're all sitting down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just about to get started.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light's faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to go to bed for breakfast.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be made.
I turned over the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone acquires their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when it is washed.
The truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm blaming him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I escaped from class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it's gonna be hard for me to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll have him go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep like a abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I've been curing my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them back.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip his morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
You can't make it this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's screaming.
Please say it again.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's getting close.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She was at school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's hot!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the crime scene.
I asked him the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is, who's gonna tell him?
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarcasm?
Tom's a cheerleader.
I'm gonna have to try to deal with this alone.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than 30 messages yesterday.
Are you sure you don't make diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What Is the Answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd has gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is erratic.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut my sandwich off.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom's got two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my lucky man.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left some uneaten food on the plate.
Tom's changing directions.
There's no living man in the classroom.
Missile's on the way.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little cocky.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
Have a good trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was being considerate.
Tom tried to keep her busy so that Mary would not ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping this seat for him.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers are soaring fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We're out of money.
There was hate among them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I wouldn't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
He and I are friends.
I may admire others, but I've never grinned to be anything but what I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't make me hot.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Children are sometimes afraid of the dark.
Stay away from me.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom was sad.
I've got Cuban hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is. I liked him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them bark.
It's too bad I didn't ride a bike here.
I have to go see Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What'd you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to overshadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
You sure you don't want to consider another option?
You didn't give them a chance.
He showed up all of a sudden.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That'd be fun.
He's a sex dealer.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too much.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I didn't know whether to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether he's coming to visit us next month.
The puppets run the wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were teasing her for her clothes.
You'll get confused.
I'm not gonna follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure suppresses it.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm health bees.
You can go now.
They're stalling.
Tom's second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
The tourists weren't happy.
Tom took his socks off.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom's stuttering.
Laws are like spider webs, hunting flies, but they let the wasps and hornets get through.
You're proud of peacocks.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left the key to his desk, just like he used to.
He took off his fur coat down, climbed up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing on this subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was wrong with Tom.
You want your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fed up.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait at the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long has Tom been here?
She's texting her boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He's avoided danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to do that?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
This handle doesn't spin.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Nice to meet you."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked him not to interfere.
We have a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me take a breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can chain me up, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat buried its claws in my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What were you doing so late?" "I spoke on the phone with my ex."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed by something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're disturbing me.
His rank isn't high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I hit him in the jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm taking a break for lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone turned down Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can get you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to dissipate them.
Tom was beaten up.
We're really good.
He fell asleep driving and caused an accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why is Tom doing this?
I have an assignment for you.
How does a set of nouns get formed?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I'm getting a bad cold from him.
It's improved.

I saw Tom.
He's not even mad.
Tom put the gun down.

Get me some coffee.
You're so good.
It was a sneaky trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where'd this come from?
We're not done.
Tom was put in prison for espionage.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom aren't too disappointed.
These little letters are read only with a magnifying glass.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear grief in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He'd do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say anything you don't mean.
I decorated my room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what it's like.
Let Tom drive his own mess.
Our chun was approaching the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute, my laundry's ready. I'm gonna go get it.

I need to get away from her.

A boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by with a wheel.
When was the last time you found the baby?
My muscles are a little sore.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm a hunchback.
They're gonna fire me because I'm so late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a trick.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There are no smokers here.

I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?

I think you know the rules.
I sincerely regret that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He came back at six.
Let these people go.

Radio's off.
I turned down Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money at a bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're coming with me and a dot!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our best.
I'll pay.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.

Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They were quiet talking.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going to the point.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were being chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig you wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much.
You're a good cook.
There's no shorter way to the top, only the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's been paid a lot.
It was sad.
I can tell you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automobiles are now being distributed.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I cheated on Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The general was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making an oatmeal.
I love the blue color.
The girl set the bird free.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugarcoat my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with it, it'll be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipe?
She's been picked out nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a bum.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me the other night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Let's guess.
He's undressed to take a bath.
The river of sweat began to pour on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you guys get out of here?
Movies are a great distraction.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests should we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask your opinion.
They canceled our flight due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they'll come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world is shining the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's close by.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary wants a hot cup of coffee and Tom wants milk.
I gave him a false address.
I'm out.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They're starting to shoot.
Tom's giggling.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm having a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether or not he can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
I have to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where were you, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a slow attitude toward nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women love men with mustaches.
Have you forgotten your wallet again?
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't even lucky.
His body was grown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I like to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent songwriters.
There can be no coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom wishes he'll never come back here again.
No one likes crybaby.
She was crying about a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's a real whack job.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate very nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's good to remember.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine's a drug.
This is a little bit harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'll come save you.
I've got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We're fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a second.
Her long hair was bony brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for a handle.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a couple of donuts.
I'm French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls aren't playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I've been reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wit.
We need to get back to Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear a suit.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clients make up mostly the poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do the same.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname is perfect for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He took out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like to go.
Tom seems a little down this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his ass.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are buzzing.
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a dick!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complex.
Tom wouldn't give up.
Tom got suspended.
They were hooking up.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks like he's fucked up.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's all right.
You're capable, but you're stalling.
He works at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
We might have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's furious.
It's from work.
We'll manage.
Commendation moves students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measures on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “lady ” was used only for nobles.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can a man choose only one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't have been safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Would you mind staying for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your children's laughter.
Tom suspects Mary and I are working on something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins fights.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the lightning?
Don't mix business with pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with his work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unlocked.
This is one of mine.
There's nothing stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and pointed it towards the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he was hungry, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank loaned one million dollars to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it easy.
My son always interrupts me when I talk.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday, my head's shot, and I'm so hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember his name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
He wants a sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I said mine.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
There were so many more of them than there were of us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
A day of rage.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their point?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did Tom get hospitalized?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned how to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood vessel burst in my eye.
That's where Mary went yesterday.
You've gone too far!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show's going to give up; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom often swim?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
I feel like reading books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom seems like a jerk.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come in the car.
I'm grateful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had a suitcase smaller than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was gonna pour the weeds.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I first met you?
Lightning is usually accompanied by lightning.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom hit him on the ground.
This lecture is not over!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while you're driving a bike.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you're not sleeping?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I set fire to the trash.
We both saw him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was still.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two annual times in the tropics.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this wonderful?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back in touch with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say over the door?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
Now we're looking for them.
My shoes are all over the place.
Tom would have fought back.
She always works hard.
What country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I prefer cats' dogs.
There's still a little space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
This heat is not maintained.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you right away.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean to.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you could say.
I can't handle this job.
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree's floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yell at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to sympathize.
There's still some tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism — Religion or Philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's a fine saw handler.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any Internet site.
They've abandoned the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for about a week.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a vytropop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was crushed with semen.
Tom's fair.
This is what you should do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand what happened to you.
Tom seeks to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom should be leaving now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was a barefoot.
Tom would have enjoyed this.
Tom's getting up there.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The nail hit the tire.
We made wood.
This is much better.
I'll make her cut your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You're baking bread in your ovens.
You're a good girl.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We used to eat lobster and squeezing.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've hit the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for it.
It's still not right.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you honest?
The cup was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you back.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I stopped by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I take a shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom gets blurry.
Tom was taking pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, you are?"
The lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They've raised my salary again.
I'll never even get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his job.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom set all this up.
I'm not betraying her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's milky.
Before that, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way from here.
Tom wants to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained to do that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, that violates all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are men of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was dropping manure.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake if you borrowed Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary the papers at the bureau.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
The moral choice is for the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he produced.
You're ugly.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'm gonna keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eye and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
That you've found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure in the dust.
We went down the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
It's up to you.
That's doable.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to get to know her granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
Smells like flowers to me.
Tom's pissed himself off.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed the fire extinguisher and started a syringe.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in a lot of difficulties.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think they're cut out for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom looks indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's jammed.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so our conscience does make us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You made a mistake.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The wound on his knee is now festering.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom's a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
Who's Tom sleeping from?
It's our job to help them.
He's suffered a lot of losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint candy?
Why would you do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
The blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy man to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids were drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married when he was 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom apparently doesn't often understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the magnificent mirrors she has in her house.
I'm not a local.
What's in the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She's a good swimmer.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I've decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to piss Tom off?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's counting with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
Oh, guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's morning.
Mr. Gorbachev, take this wall down!
Tom looks terrified.
Tom's showing off.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't like being retired.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right now.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me back.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl who wears the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you talking about?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
How were your teachers?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince has inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write your sentences?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home on Friday night was when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think is gonna change.
That's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in my ass.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's just mad.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satisfy my thirst.
Tom got here just in time.
It's boring television today.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got to say good-bye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds completely valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom has arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
There, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept Mary quiet all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather the soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam coming up.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still love a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started bitching.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work earlier.
We've got everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be established objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weak.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming waking up from a nightmare.
Tom's got a weak eye.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are you doing Tom's things?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not overjoyed that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put on your apron.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
I've already written everything I needed written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in this room?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very impertinent.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatojeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back on his feet.
That's how you need it.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom got himself a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They've crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You'd better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one in that place.
Stop!
You want some cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means bright.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's stupid.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut your hair.
Worrying is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay them well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's staring inside.
At the same time, you're heavy and easy and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
Let's say you're right now.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's what disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't think I understand.
Tom's spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm in charge.
Tom hit Mary in the head with this one.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusher written.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom wasn't even crying.
You wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom turned the handle.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is more sad than stupidity and indifference.
Everyone's talking to them.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What do websites stop from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you as happy as you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on a train while he was on the job.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm getting some sleep.
It's not scientifically proven that there's a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing on the computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Press this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom tore up his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I can see the way things are.
I make really stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very much like mine.
I was just eating, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees have collapsed.
Lions don't know color.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Few passengers survived the accident.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a paragraph from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I've got shit coming out of my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They cast a curse on us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked Mary for her help.
I've decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The turtles have lived a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very tight.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you take the car here?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
You're weakening something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you get that?
The question is, who will make that decision?
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'd rather have the eggs from the submersible.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We've lost faith in mankind.
Tom's handling the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom, loan me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants have died.
Hang on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love it.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's kissing up to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom shaved his face.
What use do I have of you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when he wears that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed us.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a kind of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to babysit his kid.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
It's the third time.
We should get out of here.
This is an air pasta popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us pursue virtues and give up vices.
You're smart.
I'm against the projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's a record of writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most opportune time.
This dog's staring at me like he's trying to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they weren't real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies once in a while.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this right in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is ginger aubergine.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not incomprehensible.
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom's backing out.
Don't repeat yourself.
Cherries are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You've made Tom miserable.
Warm it up.
Tom looked like he was having a hard time.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a joyous girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't you dare drop it.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test.
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was fabulous.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
I'm on it.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's go to lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What were you gonna say?
Make two lines.
Titles should draw the attention of readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
Tom is once again confident.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illness is fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us back.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which one would Tom choose?
The hospital isn't that big.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not yelling at their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I want freedom, I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
It's on its way.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon lighten up.
The wall's cold on the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was dressed up.
It was so cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big boat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag yourself home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
Half the species are married.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
They're Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially beneficial job to make up for everything I have done.
Tom tied his ropes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in a number of different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the axes poisoned?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're wrong, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary provided a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the etiquette.
You've seen what I can do.
We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance fit your age?
How about me?
Not everything is honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom got carried away.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
The falcons have sharp eyesight.
I wrote them that.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was honking.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom's smiling politely.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took his weight off.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he needed to take care of some things.
How does that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The little island from a distance looks like a turtle.
Do trout bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop bragging.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You ain't got no idea how long.
The dog was barking at him.
Let's go to a movie.
Handsome women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He tripped him.
Mary felt her face warmed up.
I know what upsets Tom so much.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed it.
Please come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom needlessly raises a javelin.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking up the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm in terrible pain here.
I hate this rug.
I'm a little sick.
Tom got interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the painting.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everyone's talking to him.
Faith involves hoping in what reason cannot be hoped for.
Tom used to hang out with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You've been ruining your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent to value.
We rented a movie.
The snorkel's coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They've chosen a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "All right, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's dragging in the back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for a raise in their salary.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten before, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What the hell do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The heater's stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
How about I see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like it's covered.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
My day was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's flu sick.
I don't wait very long.
Just look at you.
This is beautiful.
Missing before both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to a dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They've listened.
Tom's out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's pissed.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They've torn it apart.
Tom's a big titty.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm asleep.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He's throwing himself up like an eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick up Tom and then come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off the mask.
It's just another option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm embarrassing myself.
I liked the way you dance.
I need you a little bit.
They lied to us.
Tom's the one.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you mutilate him.
It's white.
Sit down.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you for a second?
We're not gonna let you die.
The shoes are squeezing me.
Tom didn't say anything about that.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you catch up with those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your policy is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I messed up.
It's healing me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in the city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice has melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must have made it very easy for you.
They never caught me.
I love my homeland.
I don't know how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't charm me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They're seen in the mirror.
It's not my place to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two have gone against me!
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won't be worth the wait.
I have to buy a new turn for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What's this really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary left on our first day.
Let's make out.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
"Don't you want to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite item.
Tom took his weight off.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her waist.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I'm gonna go look for them.
Tom came even though it rained.
I don't want to use a dildo. I prefer real dicks.
I won't cook for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing on Sunday.
Tom's been surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's gonna go alone.
Tom only had fives at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The dentist implanted a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They've contacted local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me this card.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I have an apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 allowance a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom's scaring me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour out the wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with an elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times as much testosterone as women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really turns me on.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is concerned about itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three brown spoon sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in its thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's what I suspected.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe isn't your friend or your ghost, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You need to buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do after that?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little?
First, I'm gonna take a bath.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a Chukunbaba just a few days before she turned ninety-nine.
Did you look everywhere?
It's important to think that no one is a hundred percent.
He's gesticulating when he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm truly happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, but because of his age and fragile health, he was allowed to serve that sentence at home.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who have been run over by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom's got the tree.
The land is still watered, most likely to give up the sword.
I was taking a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She's looking forward to becoming an actress.
I broke my plastic bottle.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're fine.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom is very negligent.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little redder.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there and kept quiet.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a mess.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fusher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will let you know when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peaches are mild.
It doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I tell you?
Peanuts fall out of the tree.
Do you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got an "A" in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How quickly did you get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's not a big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to dress up this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that warm either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is an act of refusal to forgive.
The door creaked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's laying out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember correctly.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
You're pushing me pretty hard.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of the birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you get some rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary did.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky has cheered up.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.
That's not exactly something a man should be getting ready for.
Tom and Mary are playing remi.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom's relying on Mary.
I'll call security.
You think I'd prefer a son?
How did you get here?
You picked up the book.
Don't get my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked in two hours.
From him I found out about you.
I know you're upset right now.
It's gone.
A long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Are you cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom senses danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
It was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Did you write in your journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can you do it on your own?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into this right now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll do my best to get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're pretty much ready.
Tom's got a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I can't.
Tom’s books are translated into many languages.
He's not comfortable with me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take your butt off.
I helped him open the table.
I had a potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is ugly.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom's drunk.
I slept in the coon.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could really work.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asal Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded it to Tom on the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have had fun going to the party.
You saved the bell.
You've got me all over my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stopped.
You're having fun continuing your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can make it here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demec need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't know. I'm guessing.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just trashed Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
You got in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent her to the table with the new flies he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed.
The landscape is magnificent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to control myself.
The fall is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so magnificent.
It was about Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I'd like to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, gifted with reason and conscience, and should treat one another in the spirit of universal human beings.
Getting hit was an accident.
This building has a lightning bolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything on his own.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Soup's too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom stared at the tunnel.
How could you want to be my friend?
It seems familiar to me.
I envy you.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basilica, the sage, the rosemary, the thyme, and the oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a discerning man.
Everything looked fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
Maybe she lied to you, but neither did I!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I got hurt.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a hoodie.
It's easy to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his back.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how likely that sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to get stabbed.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was nice.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It doesn't seem to be considered asking Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't need to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorie?
They'll get it soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary's tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make a face for him.
I've been waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing under the street in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a few reasons coming to mind.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
Everyone's got it all figured out.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there was a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the journal in a drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't know about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are plague vectors.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom says it.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The King did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm so excited about Tom.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused an accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary by waving.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use the cameras?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's the bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need any help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would you do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me out a little.
Am I too early?
It sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed awake until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom's going somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why he was chosen.
It's an unspoken fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We need to give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom got a little frowny.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogotá, and Osaka is like Medelin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd get it.
Survivors are a kind of mammal.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, lighten up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm making my toast with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Watch the count.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call you when I was in the car.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it all off.
Tom's choking.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take my weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
How do we benefit from that?
I'm with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "All right, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick word.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's no good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to be redeemed.
It's a message for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
He waved the dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demec, I wrote this book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be conceited.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
In order to prepare the soil for planting, you have to plow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
Nobody listens to you.
All right, you got me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Oblivion and hate usually go together.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Laura.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff's here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How much stomach do I do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
What was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a pie.
You have very perceptive eyes.
Isn't that understood?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's get you inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems more reliable.
Would you like some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They've developed an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mass.
Tom wiped the knife blade off the jeans.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your palate bleeding?
Just let her call me back, okay?
Tom put his beer pint on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
Give me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was stalking her.
Why would they mind?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to set us free.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could have broken the tank?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression in several periods of his life.
You want me to grab your bags?
I'd trust that with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class has gone wild.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the tow truck.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you've made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in private.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was hungry.
She's an Anglican student.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We've come to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis were burning books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit out the chewing gum.
Let's make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's been acting weird.
Probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda about her interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are just as strong.
The president looked strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than I did.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tight-ass.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What the hell, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer is careful.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now it's time to make amends.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll manage.
Does she have a dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French more deeply than he really spoke.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are all over the place.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The Sphinx started to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusher did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed upset.
Please tell them what to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
He's doing a good job.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese to cow cheese.
We get that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut the wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini's all the way.
Ednipol's couples shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
Still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The table is plastic.
Sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They've got it all figured out.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He's got me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
You brought lunch, we've got a plan to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
There's a red light on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
There's blood circulating through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My thumb hurts on my right leg.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince like?
Where are we going?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's up for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
They built their houses out of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this right now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
So you didn't say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
What age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You guys were right.
It's happening.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't freak Tom out.
It's a difficult task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, dear.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I'm not here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about it by now.
My mother's sister, too.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom is incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It went red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm getting sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom caught a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these suggestions in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You don't need to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
I've had my headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't be sorry.
Isn't that unusual?
I fell out of the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.
Tom unwrapped his scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was in the middle of ruins.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Hand me the pliers.
The Hashkas love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the buffalo.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his father very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom had a good day.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing what I wanted.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there have been no charges.
The lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary getting ready to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, they brought it up, and they married it; the heat-heated river was boiling water.
He feels hatred for his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When will it be my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It's not often someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I could barely save myself from being caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the son of a bitch?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
I don't mind here.
You tricked me.
It's about sin.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're messing with her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I acted like that.
I was in three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We've got fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
Looks like you have an infection.
I can't think of anything better.
The sky is red at night.
I came to wish you luck.
I'd love for you to come.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I don't speak any English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan got this right.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's warm here in hell.
I missed that.
This is your work!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Kids, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is he barking at your dog?
Wonderful!
The palace has a tall tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone awry.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't sleepy.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here by himself.
I forgot my scarf.
We've been through a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he died.
Scientific research often requires difficult compromises.
Tom just got his prosthetics out.
I have to try and find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed it.
I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you for who you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying that?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or you'll get kicked out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long does it take?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for your meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's starting to get dark.
Tom's been raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's been blind since birth.
The book contains fifteen life stories.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
The socks and shoes are new.
I haven't had pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
Tom's buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Did she die from an overdose of sleeping pills?
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not actually big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a slaughter.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's raining.
Shoo, dog!
They jumped in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we've eaten enough.
This is very difficult for them.
Witches don't cry.
Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks terrified.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're disorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Do you have any sports?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom wasn't told he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I only practice to look nice when I'm naked.
For a thousand years, it's been a thousand years.
I'll put it on your tab.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's an honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together, it wasn't even written.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you describe it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a kid.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I like cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was so sweet.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a midget.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider bite.
Tom didn't really want to live in Boston.
The price of wisdom is greater than that of pearls.

I'll wait for you here.
I know I have to sleep now.
I can make her help you.
That new song is called "Slutty."
It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six dollars.
We all have our own price.
The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
Legend has it she was a mermaid.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to talking in public.
He was crying out of happiness.
Tom got out of prison.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to light green.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
It's getting on my head.
I took my head off.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to end it.
I'm gonna go change.
You hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find me a title.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, could have happened here.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to mold.
You should try writing your respects.
I'll sit over there.
She's older than him.
I baked them a cake.
Tom is very patient.
We're good to go.
Come alone.
You ran a pencil out of your pocket.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't take any chances.
Isn't that good news?
Suppose she was here.
Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just looking at himself.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom's waiting for us.
I like to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, you're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It rained two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you.
You really should have let me get a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The cannon from the horse's hooves calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the subject completely.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He's outvoted his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom's permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what do we do about it?
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate it.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'd have done the same for me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much money as I do.
I flushed one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is there a difference?
Come and see us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your bag?
Sleep will help her most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll get the dishes.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
He's been doing a lot of intensive work lately, but he doesn't see the least of it.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you'd like.
I'm not sure.
That's no longer necessary.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom sleeps tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
He spent the last night drinking in a meat inn.
I'm in.
Do you need a date?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to make it up to you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is just a joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen the rainbow.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have any tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to lie down.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave Tom alone.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
We were just a few people in a group of gorillas back then.
She started sticking her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?
Have you told Tom about the backache you have?
That's what everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
A is a set composed of members B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom exercises violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I yearn for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She managed to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the willpower when it comes to practicing.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room has a gun.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this kind of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on your face.
Was it hard for you?
Tom was barely hearing his voice.
Don't make a sound.
I've decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We'll have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one's gonna find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna be waiting.
I'm starving you to bend over.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was coming down slowly.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to do it anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to take our mind off our problems.
I called yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child cried and cried for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't have done it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might be needed.
I've got chest pain.
I can't untie this knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show up first.
My dad's a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new watch.
Doesn't look very different.
You've learned.
Tom made Mary's room on the bench.
We're messing with him.
That's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did you put her in?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse is pretty accurate.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary came out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I'm already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do this alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done it.
Let me see him.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was on my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
You pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom's got the fog.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to rule.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are redundant.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?
Tom cried his mouth out.
That smells like cheese.

I can feel it in your touch.
You fell off a tree.
Tom told Mary he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in a half-bed.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.

You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.

You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom's running to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with pool, barbecue, football pitch and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should have given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been wasted.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do anything."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom let go of the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're getting close to a solution.
You're not that horrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar contradictions: one was honest and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to give up.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not going to fall for it.
She shut down the computer.
She bought it at the butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two kinds in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are amazing.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to carry them.
The noise has clouded the whole city.
A man who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you hand over Tom's note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was a jerk.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There might be some discussion about that.
Women don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, secondly, your argument was based on an incorrect assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm growing livestock.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom participate, too?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom can't be seen anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the front of the building, and when I passed it by with a car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
Doing so without much help will not be easy.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave him a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, that's what's gonna happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You're gonna get a mustache.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser throws out hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone help me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.

For the record, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a beaver.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That's what surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you winking when we're kissing?
Someone's gonna see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agree.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom' run.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
The Lord created the Seven.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames from the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Everything or nothing.
This information is classified.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does the class start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What do they want me to be?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old-fashioned guy.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got woolly hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's so strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was affected.
My conscience is bothering me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You've been fooling around a lot.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with your parents?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I pay you my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most reliable advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed things.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to light your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to take a shower.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll go away.
They'd only bother Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's up to you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The pre-breakfast walks are refreshing.
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
Wasn't that terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt all the time.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm kidding.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom's groaning loud.
It was Butter.
Tom started snoring.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was crazy.
The tin is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money has clouded my glasses.
So, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see Al's flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it'd be hard to pull it off.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Although I am a devout man, I am still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there a problem I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the prize.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to investigate something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in the mean.
What was Tom's attitude?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got it wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
The marzipan pigs don't gnaw.
Tom's coming to.
Tom angered Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it already.
You'd better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We looked out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for it yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must've jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
Doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me give Tom a message.
Where's my golf kit bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not delinquents.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on that.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my 16th birthday today.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You scratched your collarbone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blinding.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was insolent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom adheres to strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom moaning.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve for that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to a hairdresser.
Tom's crazy as hell.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
You don't need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look terrified.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of my house with my slippers.
I think Tom's a clepidal.
She had a terrible infection and her ovary leaked.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It's out of the question.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's been acting weird sometimes.
We'd hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a capillary cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have questions in tons.
This is an interesting, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Each language has a different view of the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We've got everything.
What's one beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her, everything?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we had a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you'd found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit down or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for demequres?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shivering at him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people do you have in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You made your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little cocky.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy this stuff.
Not here, not there.
The phone books are fascinating.
You don't need to be defensive.
This is the most beautiful pizza in the whole town.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
