In my view, the literature programme was shaped by ladies of the Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From 19th - century Russian literature, we preferred Danielevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, in terms of the same ladies of the Balzak age.
And the psychology and torture of Tolstoy and Turgeneva's heroes are not that interesting for adolescents.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very, very much.

Matrix Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has a different hardness of sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexd coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft – a shallow natural latex.
The spring block from 1,000 springs per square metre is rapidly adapted to the sleeping body, warning the appearance of a “wave” or “gamaka” effect.
Among the qualities of the model, breathing materials should be provided.
The latex perforated for air permeability is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, as is the coconut coy.
This keeps a healthy microclimate of the place of sleep.
The mattress is also subject to an extended warranty period.
The period of official guarantee from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the duration of operation of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is due to the decommissioning of the Jacquard supplied in the kit.
Get an orthopaedic cushion in pairs with the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the appointment of the parties – coconuts serve as anatomic support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Germany: 4th Coronary Curve Inescapable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
In the expert ' s view, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with renewed force.
Despite an active campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the vaccine from the coronavirus are likely to be insufficient to provide full protection.
The head of the Association of Doctors of General Practice, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, 11 December, Die Welt reported this.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will take place in the summer, at the latest in the autumn”, the expert believes.
In addition, Weigoldt hopes that the fourth coronary vaccine can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of Omicron.
However, the new option is particularly dangerous.
So the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than in the Delta or Beta strains.
This is illustrated by the results of a preliminary study in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omicron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against contamination with the new version of Omicron.
A study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses the effectiveness was significantly lower: “the neutralising potential was reduced by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection”, stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zaltzberger, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, as Zaltzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronary virus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Vobler Pontoon21, Beth-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibrations by what was originally created with regard to the use of the submarine, not just for the purpose of catching the catch.
These vents have more than the equivalent dimensions, a weight, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting lures.
Another recognized feature is the top fin of durable and flexible plastics, which creates additional vibration shades with vertical and horizontal wires.
As a winter vibrate, Bet-A-Vib displays a rather aggressive game when fishing for bat-A-Vib.
Often the most catchable is the simple monotonous animation, i.e. the movement of the skewer up and down almost without pause.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a limited area, with a cloudy underwater vegetation, curves and other obstacles for which a lock is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching a vessel and a large perch in winter, especially in the middle of winter, when accurate and aggressive bait is required.
By reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib rotates instantaneously and returns to the reference vertical.
At the same time, Bet-A-Vib is also used successfully for winter fishing for trout.
To please its caprism, you can choose from two modifications: the NS (NanoSound) or without it (SL (Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is a game in the balance that can irritate a passive pike that does not even react to the nerve.
In fishing, Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This breeze is understood and not captivated, well combined with wood and knit cords even with large diameters.
To catch a hammer, a boat, an arsha or a coon, except for a uniformly relevant and a step, sometimes with a “wiring” at the bottom.
If you're fishing in a crowded area, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the probability of constipation.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most sustainable in its work and, consequently, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, it can be used on relatively small and very deep plots.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries declared
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (FVC) Wagner.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of the Supreme Council of State of the Republic of Khaled Al-Mishri announced this.
“There are currently more than 7,000 Wagner FVC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They're also digging trenches in Sirte and Coofre.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabi Airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " , the Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were “trying to seize” the central part of Libya from Chad to the Mediterranean after “bringinging their people to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the interlocutor, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbase and port in Sirte, as well as airbase in Jufre, is noted in the Agency's publications.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else could the mercenaries be?
According to the Agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine countries in Africa - the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagnera subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries," the article states.
According to the media, the Wagnerians allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.
The group is neither in the force departments nor in the juries register, and its fighters are not on the personnel manifests.
The company is under US sanctions.
It is recalled that the previous post-wars of the 27 EU countries have approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan Supreme Council of State de facto is the second Chamber of Parliament with advisory functions with dominant Islamists, TASS writes.
The body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of parliamentary deputies and the Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“Before the elections, less than two weeks remain, and the chances of them passing in time are dwindling rapidly,” the material notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed indefinitely the publication of the final list of candidates, broadcasts Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with the eyes of the Russians
38 per cent of Russians see foreign policy as more success than failure, 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
"Problems of success - "in Syria protected, restored peace there," "Decision on the North Stream-2", "the whole world was threatened by that cool weapon," "Crime we held back."
The main failures are “conflicts with Ukraine”, “conflicts with Western countries”, “insulatement from peace”, says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai Government has completely renounced paperwork, and all the civil servants have become digital as well.
The Government of Dubai has reported a complete rejection of paper production and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided electronically.
This is reported by the WAM Emirite Information Agency.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitisation of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," the successor prince of the Emirates, the President of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Maktum, said Saturday.
The internal and external documentation in all Dubai State offices will now be digitally only through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, GCQ, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to an electronic government and the digitalization of the document began in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobianin had said that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkish car production and export dropped below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and export declined sharply in November, amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, 11 months ' output of industry was worse, Bloomberg reported, referring to data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the Association, 115,000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Some 75,000 cars were shipped for export, which is more than 25% below the last year ' s rate.
And if the first 10 months of this year showed positive developments in Turkey ' s road sector by last year, the result of 11 months of 2021 was 0.3 per cent lower than last year ' s.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira rate, which in November was 29 per cent compared to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IAS entities were suspended on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov described the situation of granting concessions to small and medium-sized businesses, reporting to the MIA "Casinform" correspondent.
“As reported by the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, this year, pursuant to the mandate of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, an order was adopted by the Chairman of the Agency dated 9 April 2021, No. 127, “Approval of the order for the deferral of payments on loans to small and medium-sized enterprises”, wrote Alihan Smailov in his reply to the parliamentary request.
He recalled that the procedure for deferral of payments on loans was to allow banks and microfinance organizations to defer payments on loans granted up to 1 April 2021 to IAS entities, including IPs, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the entity of the IAS.
The Borrower ' s application could indicate a different period of deferment of payments.
During the period of deferral of the borrower, claims were suspended, notice of the need to pay the arrears, as well as the collection by the creditor of commissions and other payments.”
During the year 2021, the second-level banks received requests for deferment of payments of 603 IAS borrowers, of which 553 IAS entities received a 9.7 billion tenge deferral.
In IFIs, 131 IAS entities have applied for suspension, of which 95 entities have been granted a delay of 105.8 million tenge”, concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with a weak immunity could easily bear the omicron strain.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry it more easily than those with a strong protective response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Purassev explained why the strain of the ocmyrone crown virus could be dangerous.
There's a reason to look for a virus when it's born.
Scientists believe that the “ocmirone” was born into a body infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
I mean, when he mutated, he didn't encounter any resistance from immunity.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very quick.
Apparently, there's more of these spikes, the spikes, than is said, their antibodies weren't cut during mutations, says Pulmonologist Sergey Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system could carry "ocmyrone" more easily than those with a strong protective response.
It turns out that a strong response from the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
That's what happens when a 30-year-old dies when a 60-year-old is schizoid.
The young man's immune response is completely inadequate: where one could only threaten with a finger, it beats like a sparrow gun,' concluded Sergey Purassev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronary has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
The inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case you can often only buy symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body -- temperature, weakness, nausea.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain to the right or to the left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age may be vaccinated in Russia by the end of the year.
A virologist, head of the IFTI genetic engineering laboratory, Pavel Wolchkov, noted that this category is very active in the acid.
Young people who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as the kindergartens,” said Pavel Wolchkov, virologist, head of the IFTI genetic engineering laboratory.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of yeast
The authors examined the fat left over from the bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with the coronary virus.
Immunoskeletal cells located in the fat tissue, macrophages, have also been infected, showing a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of acid and found particles of the coronary in the fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in fat tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid a response to the immune system.
SARS-COV-2 is probably also capable of this.
A biologist described the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Semen Goloseikin, described the causes of dementia and described its methods of prevention in the Sputnik radio interview.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is a gradual loss of cognitive function, and in time, people are finding it difficult even in a familiar setting.
Glosseikin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, the role of factors such as social exclusion and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a life - style.
Among the early signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduce abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and a risk factor for hearing”, the biologist added.
In order to prevent the occurrence of a WHO disease, WHO recommends that the required level of physical loading be maintained, that cognitive skills and capabilities be trained that require memory and logic.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artefacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, on the television channel Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of Bibles in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gouad explained that all smuggled artefacts were registered in archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions worldwide and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored upon return and then exhibited in museums.
He said one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutankhamon's bust sold at the auction in London.
Christie's auction house held auctions on 4 July where a bust over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the subject of art was smuggled out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
Tutankhamon’s head, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been auctioned since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegal monuments of antiquity from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by black diggers.
"Criminal Tatars are not taken into account" - and that is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people live in Crimea.

Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of employees
Credit Suisse requires his staff to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, says Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its staff with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone by a telecommunication partner.
Under the current rules, the bank can browse information on corporate devices issued to its staff because they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if the staff member has used it to meet with a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to a remote operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with business issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank ' s management has set a deadline for staff members to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Jessen's life - 1925 - was fruitful in the arts, but harder for the earthly being of the poet and his "him".
He's already out of literature, he's mixed up with imaginism, he's famous, he's used, he's sometimes strongly insulted by critics, even viciously, but the reader's audience is ready to carry him.
Over 60 poems were written in a year, many of them true masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persidical Motivations", written the poem "Anna Snowgin", published 8 books, "Russia Sovieta".
And the main success -- at the end of June 25th, the Goszdat entered into a contract with Essene for the release of his works in the 3rd volumes.
None of the modern-day Sergey Alexandrovich poets have ever been honored, he's the first!
In addition, it was very good money - the contract fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the factory manager received 300 rubles per month, the engineer 200).
The funds were needed that year more than ever.
Autumn married the granddaughter of Lviv Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, had to build a family home, hold Sisters Katya and Sasha, and mother.
It's like life is perfect, there's something to be happy about, but for him, everything is mostly in dark tone, as if the Black Man nightmare had been materialized from the poem (written in November 1925 and published since the death of Fallin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
That's what the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field,
As I grow in September,
He's brainwashing alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Jessen had given up heavily, looked ill, and apparently ill.
Relapses, nervous breakdowns, are becoming more and more common.
And probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism - Sergey Alexandrovich was being treated, there are no credible documents left.
In May 1923, when Essenin insisted on the fourth wife, American Isedora Duncan was correcting health at a clinic under Paris by Professor Peter Hannushkin (the foundation of Essenin will be two years later, already in Moscow).
And here are the evidences of the poet's singing, the scandals on this ground, the police's connections are enough, scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20's, a terrible poem by a green snake has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jessen lived for a short time with a friend, imaginist Ivan Starceva.
Surprisingly, Jessen’s very good income never had his own place in Moscow or in Peter, was found in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old man remembers:
"I came only to stay the night, and in most cases in an irresistible, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Jessen fell on a staircase...
Falling out, scratching his face and wheezing.
When he came to his senses, he began to cough all over the place with blood."
And Jessen himself, after the war on Europe and the United States (then there was a dry law, but Duncan accepted a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I've seen nothing but kabobs and streets...
I'm already at the end and I've stopped remembering...
Well, I've been drinking, of course...
And I drank because I was so sad."

Matrix Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern performance of the budget model in the premium class ambulance.
The base of the mattress is an independent double spring block duet.
Inside the large spring is a softer spring of small size.
This allows the load to be evenly distributed to the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is complemented by an artificial latex.
It's an analogy to a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material enhances the comfort of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress is ideal for a couple with a large difference in weight (30 kg).

Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as “weapons” against the EU
The Polish M.I.D. believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Jablonsky, expressed the view that President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intends to return to such “operation” next year.
A related statement by the MlD was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jablonski, sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “stopped by Lukashenko”, but he is “actively looking for new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As the web site kp.ru had written, the European Union had previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched on 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they expressed their willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide list of products from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

Not a Shadow Hat: When a shabby jacket makes a man laugh
During the 2021 world events, velvet jackets dominated them.
Perhaps Daniel Craig was the first to make his new fashion decision.
As early as September, he appeared at the premiere of the movie "Not Time to Die" in a velvet robin jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first awarded the Economist The Earthshot Prize a non-Kingly Dress Code green velvet jacket and then chose a more classic option for the Royal Variety charity event.
A few weeks ago, the trend was similar to that of Lionel the Messiah.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for shabby men's pajamas in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, they were purchased 1.4 times more frequently in Gazetu.Ru.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with pads and silhouettes, the main colors - dark beige, on-board, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rubles, and men prefer to buy exclusively pajamas, and they choose a pair of velvet suits less.
You can't just buy them from online retailers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the segment of luxury velvet pajamas this season is represented in almost all brands - both Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which he attended one of the Prime Minister's films "Dom Gucci" by Ambassador Jared Leto.
By choosing expensive stamp jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of thread interlacing, weaving is made up of dense tissue with a corrugated outer texture and a smooth internal side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin warns that, in the case of velvet jackets, the main is not his model or his fascoon, but its appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so it's perfect if you're going to a party or a ceremony," explains Wahoshkin.
Another important criterion that allows for a choice in favour of a shabby jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a shabby jacket, first of all, needs to get a proper, well-proportioned party," according to the authors of the Telegram Channel on male fashion, "Brammel Beautiful." "The owners of shabby jackets usually belong to caste people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to a world-wide event, where a dress code is always provided.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes to combine a velvet jacket with the same items: classic pants with darts, uniform shirts, silk tie, brushes with brushes, clamps.
Too simple and everyday things will seem inappropriate.
Fashion experts from the "Bramel Beauty" are convinced that it would also be inappropriate for a private corporate employee to appear in a barhatak jacket, and that is, “the manager of the company who is responsible for the event, yes, that’s the subject matter”.
If the employee is below the rank and the goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick out financial bonuses, it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will certainly appreciate the phrase "not the Shadow hat," which the editors of the Telegram Channel consider to be a man's fashion.
Very mixed feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tempt, so it's so exhausting.
And she's completely out of association with a nice young girl's face.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of the community.
But with all my heart I wish good luck in life!
It's all about money. Alternative energy is lobbying well, so it pays off.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they in mourning?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in supply - both gas and oil and coal have bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There's a wild demand for fuel.
There's a hole in it.
Then who's in the air?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do the Indian problems touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered to be “missing” energy crises.
They've done their job.

I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
It's just mediocreity in the middle of statistical passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are confident of their beauty so much that they decide to show it on the whole car, they will not be able to fit in.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such beautiful people, but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, “a slave who is conscious of his servitude and who fights against him, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery and who is perplexed in a silent, unconscious, and unconscious slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows, when he is pleased to describe the beauty of his slave life, and delights in a good and good master, has a palate, a ham."
The immunologist stated that the re-inoccination in 4-5 months would help protect against the coronary strain of the “micron”
Revaccination in four or five months may protect against a new strain of coronary infection.
Such a statement was made by the immunologist Nikolay Krückov, who called the bend six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “a very large period”
“In the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four years,” the expert said, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to perform the re-vaccination.
Kručkov also noted that early recovery provided a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been vaccinated with two vaccines and a booster, or has been treated and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and overcame, he has been given “hybrid immunity”, i.e. many antibodies and neutralizing enough," the expert explained.
The Greater Seven warned Russia of the “scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The Greater Seven (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement on the outcome of the meeting of the heads of the MlD in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia 's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will cost Moscow dearly”, but no specific measures are described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the strengthening of Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”, says the statement.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “reduce escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to transparency of military activities”, as US President Biden spoke to President Putin during a video call on 7 December to President Putin.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Foreign Ministers of the Greater Seven also stated.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia must have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier this day, British diplomacy head Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed “the only voice of the larger seven countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer was considered 32 times less effective than omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BionNTech against the ocron strain of the coronary virus is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China, South China Morning Post (SCMP), reached this conclusion.
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicron diversity,” said Professor Malik Paíris.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccination remained the most reliable way to protect against severe disease infection with the coronary virus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the coronary pandemic, taking into account its impact on the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron strains could cause a new wave of viral circulation and increase mortality unless further measures were taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence accused the FRG of blocking NATO's arms transfers to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later eased its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
However, FT notes that the position of the new German Government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ambassador Andrey Melnik of Ukraine in Germany expressed the view that Kiev should not expect the supply of arms from Berlin to Chancellor Scholce.
He said that the previous FRG leadership had explained its refusal to provide arms at the risk of developing the military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite Russia's “occupation” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, confident diplomat, Germany will also retain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the sea fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to be “a technical partner of Ukraine”, the President added.
It was also noted that the Co-Chair of the Green Party, Robert Habek, visited the Republic this spring, in favour of selling Kiev defence weapons.

Flight... a long time ago, I did the same re-planning.
He's joined the kitchen room.
It's a three-room apartment.
It was.
Of course, the project, the permit, the new tech passport, everything by law.
The audience had a bookcase and a large wardrobe.
The kitchen door was set, and there was a pile of places.
In almost 10 years of living in this apartment, we never regretted what we had done.
Out of mistakes, they installed a cool shower instead of a bath.

Mercedes protested the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
The German Mercedes team, whose pilot, Lewis Hamilton at Grand Prix, Abud Dhabi, finished second after the Red Bull racer, Max Ferrstappen, protested the outcome of the race, reports Formula-1.
Mersedes believes that the rules “Formula-1” 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the visit.
In the first case, the German team contests the decision of the judges to return to the racers in one round with the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstappen has gone beyond Hamilton to the authorized "restart" zone.
Let's add that now the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Ferstappen has surpassed Hamilton for 2,256 seconds and won the Formula One World Championship, is preliminary when the Mercedes protests are considered unknown.
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The G7 Foreign Ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the outcome statement by the parties.
The meeting also noted that they condemned the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs”, says a statement published on the British Government ' s website.
The Ministers of the G7 and the EU High Representative noted that they “are united in their condemnation of Russian armed strengthening and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
British Head Elizabeth Trass at the Liverpool Press Conference warned of the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that the Russian troops at the border with Ukraine needed to return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis.
It was about negotiations in Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
The representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zaharov, said that, by urging Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “were unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Ways to return stolen through Internet money stores have been discovered
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in a conversation with the RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses in the possession of the bank card data, it is recommended that the main funds be stored in a map or bank account that is not used in online shopping.
Some savings may be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend the introduction of a separate map for online purchases.
If the money has been stolen from purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure, a recovery procedure may be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules established by payment systems for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in the account chain who does not use the service”, said the representative of the Communications Bank.
The expert from the international paying provider, Ecompay Arthur Zarba, stressed that the buyer had the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge a fraud operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender has used a map on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been shipped.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholtz arrived in Poland to discuss the North Stream-2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected Chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops outside Ukraine and the situation with the Russian pipeline North Stream-2.
Although Scholtz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations for each other.
Prime Minister Mateusz Moravecki of Poland said that he would call on Scholtz to speak out against the “North Stream-2” on which Russian gas was expected to be transported to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecko, Russia can use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to halt the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland ' s judicial system, however, remains one reason for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland by finding that judicial reforms undertaken by the right party “Right and Justice” violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new German Government, which was sworn in Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make public commitments to halt the North Stream-2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
US officials told Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the halting of the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior US Congress official reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, and the position was confirmed by the representatives of the Greater Seven on Sunday.
Dmitri, watch closely.
The view behind the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial planning are doubtful.
And I know these apartments very well, and I can see how well they've been replanned.
Make sure they're okay.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilets, the windows, the cranes.
You're on them once a year at the Passover, or mine, which has to be washed straight away.
Just don't let it get dirty.

Doctors warned of the risk of prolonged use of blood-inflammation agents after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irin Jarcev and Sergey Tokarev warned of the risk of uncontrolled use of blood-inflammation drugs following the disease of COPID-19 and of vaccination from the coronary virus.
A doctor, immunologist Irina Jarcev, said that self-prevention of possible thromboembolism after COVID-19 could lead to stroke.
Jarceva explained that blood-inflammation drugs were not intended for all, only if the patient had been hospitalized and was in the hospital, he had complications.
The doctor has appointed anticoagulants (blood-inflammation medications that prevent excessive thromboembolism) according to evidence.
She reported that dark besieged people are drinking anticoagulants for a long time and are suffering from complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding into the brain).
The Chief Preventive Officer of UrFO, the scientific head of the Society of Preventive Medicine, Dr. Sergey Tokarev's medical sciences, spoke with the URA.RU said that the Russian anticoagulants are now frequently used before vaccination from the coronary infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in questionable advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And in the pre-vaccination examination, doctors notice the blood flow.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptom.
Potatoes were called a super-product to protect against hypertension.

The money in the church wall will be paid $20,000
Santechniki, who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, pays the prize.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in Lakewood, a major evangelical church, where pastor Joel Austen preaches, promising that godly Christians look forward to riches and prosperity.
In November 2021, Santechnician Justin Caughley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages of money and cheques under thermal insulation.
He passed on the discovery of the church, and he said that he did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be related to a robbery that took place in Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques stored in a church safe were lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a $25,000 reward was announced for information about criminals.
Justin Caughley could not claim this amount because the prize has expired.
In spite of this, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, who at one time awarded a prize of $5,000 and later received another $20,000 in gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the Santechnician.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood church wall.
Tanya, her statements, her actions, that's her characteristic of being a real person.
That is why the attitude toward her is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially richer than all the pens," as they say.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as suddenly as challenging as this lady.

In Brazil, citizens were obliged to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, a decision was made by the Judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso to require Kovid passport States entering the territory.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have objections to vaccination are exempt from the certificate.
Exceptions also include persons from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been demonstrated.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Day’s, Pre-Knave and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which involve an increase in the flow”, said Barroso.
Earlier, Brazil ' s authorities had committed unwelcome tourists to comply with the five-day quarantine.
Comprehensive protection against COVID-19 revealed
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, spoke with Ura.ru, revealed a complete protection scheme against coronary infection.
He said that this could be done by injecting and injecting a nasal vaccine.
When administered internally, a large amount of Immunoglobulin A is formed. This is not the case when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no double vaccination decision yet," the doctor said.
The main prophylaxis of Urfo, a doctor of medical science, Sergey Tokarev, stated, in turn, that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with an injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the body was expected to be maximum.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Lower City Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that a new outbreak of the COPID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
According to him, this is exactly the kind of picture we see in other countries where another wave of pandemics came earlier.

In Europe, mass protests against vaccine opponents continue
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators came out.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make vaccination compulsory.
Since February next year, unwelcome people will have to pay a fine of EUR 3,600.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, conducted a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some had posters in their hands that said, "It's a false pandemic," "I'm not going to be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the kovid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce health passports has been taken by the authorities of several regions of the country in the light of the increasing number of cases of coronary infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it became a conflict with the guards.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement personnel used waterworks.

WHO has detected a “micron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the coronary “micron” had already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain may have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of distribution of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as at 9 December, the strain had already been detected in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has become active only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new version of the coronary virus.
WHO experts are concerned that a new strain of preliminary data could go beyond delta strains, the same Indian version of the coronavirus that now runs in all countries without exception.
Previously, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhan Gabrielesus stated that omicron strains are able to have a significant impact on the pace of the coronary pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "micron" will expel the delta in the coming months.
And the number of sick people in Britain alone will be about 1 million, with the official omicron currently in the Kingdom aching several hundred people and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain and at peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
The British health system will not be able to deal with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-Biontech against the MICron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
How the Russian Satellite V reacts to the "micron" is not yet known - this will be understandable in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Centre has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on the MICron strain.

Russia warned of a new scheme of fraud
Swindlers have begun to seek new maneuvers for video fraud.
That's what the News says with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov's Food Director, the main danger associated with the dissemination of video communications is dippheki.
In this case, fake video is produced by frauds on the basis of actual records involving the victim.
This enables neurosetics to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person’s behavior.
Abutalimov added that by using the dipface, the villains could call a friend of the victims via video or create a roll involving a copy of the person for blackmail purposes.
“Such falsifications may cause a bulling, since a forged criminal can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Alexander Vetkol, noted in turn that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technologies.

Dr. Pavlova told us about the "migres of the weekend" in the workaholics
A number of factors may lead to worsen feelings on weekends
The reason for the deterioration of self-esteem after working nights is often due to the “migrene of the weekend”, said a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, a candidate for medical sciences, a senior scientist at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the IHL, a scientist at the Zuhra Pavlov System Medicine Clinic in his cable.
According to her, it is especially common for workaholics who suffer from headaches, fractures, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of a week, there are enough objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
Our lives are changing radically on weekends.
"Let's sleep long, we've been lying on the couch all day, probably eating more and drinking less," the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it is heavy and broken.”
Late recovery is an additional role.
So if you get up three hours later, you get a reaction called jetlag.
It arises from travelers who cross several watch belts.
In order to determine which factor played a decisive role in the deterioration of self - esteem, Paul recommended that the most important change be made on the weekends.

South African scientists have stated low efficacy of Pfizer against omicron
In South Africa, Pfizer vaccine against omicron has been declared low efficacy
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of Pfizer against omicron strain of coronary infection.
It is estimated that (the level of neutralization of omicron) corresponds to (the level of) effectiveness of the vaccine by 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why... the vaccine's ability to protect against infection is questioned, according to a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts have made it clear that the drug can save you from severe disease.
Earlier in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that omicron strains of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unknown word, hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to calorie, composition and glycaemic index, may be indicated in the composition of the product.
A number of dozens of names may be shown on the label, in essence indicating sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other broken sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black stream), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that apply to mono- and dissaccharides, and they can be not only in air conditioning products, but also in ketchup, in doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roscad, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to draw attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are different in taste, but whatever the ingredient is called in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar as it is necessary to take into account not only the quantity of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that the vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be considerably higher than the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance to the FRG in 25 years
The new Chancellor of FRG, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to shift to the decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to phase out gas, oil and coal completely by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
“That is, in 25 years' time, the world will be such that the issue of gas transport to the FRG and Europe will play a different role,” the Chancellor said.
Scholtz noted that Germany remained committed to Ukraine ' s transport of Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement stating support from Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
Previously, Head Annalena Berbok of the German M.I.A. stated that the process of certification of the “North Stream 2” pipeline was continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should apply to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was not yet “compliant with the requirements” of the European Union.

Hackers hacked Twitter from the Prime Minister of India
The hackers hacked into Prime Minister Narendra Maudie's Twitter account.
The villains managed to publish a fairytale message.
India has reportedly recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate means of payment, as well as that the country has already purchased cryptocurrencies.
Maudie's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The Prime Minister said that on Twitter they quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India had already been hacked in 2020 and had been called upon to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
In doing so, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) of the voters voted in favour of New Caledonia's independence, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The show was 43.90 per cent and more than 80,000 New Caledonians participated in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections has left no room for doubt”, as independenceists have called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevented a full and “honest” campaign from taking place.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, from 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and challenge them to the UN.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, at the Palace of Elisha, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the referendum.
The topic of independence of New Caledonia has greatly revived the presidential campaign in France in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates favoured that the Territory remain in France, since it is “the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific”.
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” Eric Zemmur repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republicans, Valerie Peckress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it was not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire for the selection of the Caledonians to be the choice of France”.

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West was allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger posed by Moscow and allowed a number of offensive remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called on the Western countries to "take a united front against Russia".
The WSJ readers disagreed with the position of the American Professor.
“There is a lot of false information in this article”, RIA Novosti comments from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States of America and NATO allies will never join the nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another noted.

The 5.2 magnitude earthquake took place in the Kuril Islands area
The 5.2 magnitude earthquake took place near the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake centre was 231.8 kilometres north-east of North Kurilsk.
The father lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 Magnitude in Peru, which affected ten people.

Ukraine will start producing jet drones for a new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, jet-propelled ANKA-type drones will begin to be developed.
On 11 December, an outside adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Aleksei Arestovic reported this.
That is, they can act against aircraft, against other drones.
Even against flying pilots.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft: corpus and so forth," he quoted Dialogue.ua as saying.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA, Arestovic said that they were jettison, not push-over BPLAs.
According to him, it is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "by all characteristics".
The first batch of BPLA should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
ANKA was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Earlier, Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during the military operations of the Joint Forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky reported that the construction of a factory for the construction of modern military drones had begun in the country.
He said Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Sabunma and the Ukrainian defences concluded an agreement on the construction of a centre in Kiev to train staff, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum “a major real step forward”.
Two lions escaped at the airport from the container
The lions fled to Singapore’s Changi Airport.
That's what The Straits Times reports.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions will lie down on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not leave him because of a safety net that was installed nearby.
The opposition ended when Mandai Wildlife Group staff arrived at the airport, leading all Singapore Zoos.
They immobilized the lions by means of wires with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, it was previously reported that a lion fled from his master and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were not harmed.
Specialists warned of a risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies have shown that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, excessing the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if the figure is significantly deviated from it in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 should not be taken in tablets without the advice of a doctor, that the dosage should be monitored and milk and other foods containing folic acid should be avoided.
Rachel Feyn, a nutrition consultant, had previously called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
As it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men be more likely to have the fruit after 50 years.
In Britain, about 75,000 people may die due to omicron strain by April
British scientists are predicting that the spread of the ocron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England may cause up to 75,000 deaths, unless restrictive measures are tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which was transmitted by TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25,000 flight outcomes will be recorded in the country due to the omicron strain and approximately 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, more than 2,000 patients will be treated daily.
“Serious measures to combat the coronary virus may be required to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if omicron strains become more contagious than the delta option, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infection,” said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Agency had previously reported that if the rate of circulation of omicron strains remained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could be the dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of omicron disease have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in recent days.
On 9 December, British head of the Ministry of Health, Sadjid Javid, pointed out that this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superheroes has grown by a quarter in the world
The construction of the superpowers this year and the orders for the next year are all record-breaking despite calls for reducing the hydrocarbon footprint and combating climate change.
In the world registry of ships, the number of chartered yachts was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the will and the money for a floating fortress of 50 million pounds and above will not be reduced, writes The Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this kind of publicity on the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of contamination on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronary virus.
If all of these people had gone to the office before and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them were working away and the negotiations were conducted in a zoomy manner.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, only if their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he said.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own aircraft is a source of irritation in society because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with all mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose that new taxes and regulations be imposed on super-rich people, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to do so with such mobility.
In the meantime, only the number of super-hats ordered, but also their characteristics, is impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Rexke builds the REV Ocean yacht with a length of 183 metres.
Once we're on the water, it'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
There is a “sea basin” on the yacht, as well as an underwater boat designed to explore sea depths.
On existing super-hats, helicopter sites, open-air cinemas have become commonplace, and on some of them, such as the McGregor fighter's yacht, is a platform for fighting.A professor of economic anthropology at American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas electorals, carbon footprints produced by super-rich people are insignificant.
But it is symbolic, given that the world’s multibillionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of over-use by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission rate of billions is thousands of times greater than that of the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the world's largest polluter, Roman Abramovic, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail fell on his ship Eclipse at a length of 162.5 feet [162.5 m].
Even if the yacht owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and have the team drive the yacht from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superstars don't have sympathy for other people when, as Australia's richest wife, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, they complain through YouTube that their giant ships don't have room for a dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels 50 metres away.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol resulting in intestinal cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
That's what Daily Express says.
The experts concluded that the use of four or more alcoholic beverages per week was associated with an increased risk of cancer.
However, the likelihood of developing the disease is increasing with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately-drinking men are at higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact reason for developing this type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more specifically, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very clever.
But even they don't know how four-legged they really are.
For many years, biologists have experimented to find out for sure how animal intelligence will develop.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study shows that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Scientificert.
Dogs can't play chess or make up poems, they can't make sense of politics, economics, and art, but they can often fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and they do not give up on the ability to teach a two - year - old child.

Ukraine prepares for US and Russian trade
US$ and Russia will “traffick” over Ukraine's NATO membership, analyst Alexander Kočetkov said in his article on “Glavred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were soon planning to continue negotiations on United States guarantees that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite US leader Joe Byden's words on the right of countries to “enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something knowingly unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, you're just going to send a proposal.
And with regard to Ukraine, there is an auction," the analyst wrote.
Kočetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparation is carried out in secret, quickly and immediately, to offensive action, not waiting for the group to be detected and deployed," he said.
China stimulates the development of the rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province / Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said a representative of Howe Jawen.
High-speed trains en route to China-Laos, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure improved reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed “China’s speed”.
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd brought down the first two-storey high-speed power lines developed in China for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a pilot train train developed by the Turkish company was launched.
The train will be moving through a metropolis connecting Istanbul's centre to the city's airport.
The subway will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the highest-innovation industries and the strongest international innovation competitiveness”, said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Department of Commerce and Investment of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-quality equipment on the world market,” said Feng Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, with a number of independent research and development, China has established a good system for the production of rail transport equipment, with a full range of support tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaosyan, the country ranks first on the level of electrification of railways and on the operation of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Semen Goloseykin, spoke with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and decrease in abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, the specialist said.
Glosseikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know the effective treatments for dementia.
It is therefore necessary to start its prevention in time.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends that moderate physical load be maintained, that cognitive skills be regularly trained through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of the various Bads, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community”, said Golosaikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies requiring intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic,” said Golosaikin.
A formerly charitable organization for the study of dementia in Britain stated that disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first worrisome sign can be seen as visual problems that make the patient more difficult to identify.
Another sign of developing dementia is the aphasic state in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist required Saakashvili to be treated abroad
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psychoneural treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalists neurologist Otar Toidze, who was part of a medical consulate established under the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character are persistent," said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond the regulatory framework and that the ex-president should now be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nerve rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia”, said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after being punished by prison officers.
The Georgian policy has quickly been able to abolish the punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

In Spain, protests against COVID passports took place
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were made against the mandatory certificate of vaccination issued by COVID-19, according to Europa Press.
In the capital of Catalonia, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become compulsory to go to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many of the manifesto came to action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism with slogans on their posters and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for more than 50 people to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants.
The protestors in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronary infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic and over 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia it is also planned to impose restrictions on unvaccinated persons.
The draft laws on a single QR code system were introduced by the Government to Gosduma on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass activity, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with either a certificate of vaccination or a transferable disease, or a water supply from vaccination.
The same rules would be established for trains and aircraft.

Cool lift: how Chinese become mountain skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will bring together President Xi Jinpin's 1 trillion Yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwanese ski resort in Zhangjakou, near the site of the winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work on greening is carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjakou, there are problems with snow.
The main challenge for the long term is to ensure a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts so that all new ones become permanent.
However, it is still a long way off.
Game Advisor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognizable.
In the winter, more Chinese are sent to the slopes every year.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a mountain-ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to actively develop and build the infrastructure necessary for recreation.
A 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the Winter Olympics.
He noted that there had been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, there was a speeding railway, and now none of the locals suffer without a job.
More and more stores are being opened in the country, selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, common pies with national cuisine are opened.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan now.
China seeks to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world may be exposed to extreme poverty due to the coronary pandemic, which has hampered mankind's progress on universal access to health services, said the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published on 12 December by WHO and WB on the International Day of Universal Health coverage.
They noted that the pandemic had caused shortages in the delivery of nurseries, caused excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization has decreased, and death has increased from tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronary pandemic had left more than 100 million people in poverty, with almost four billion people lacking social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister disengaged from broadcast at the Summit for Democracy at the request of the White House
The speech by Taiwan Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan during a panel discussion during the United States-sponsored Summit for Democracy was translated into video-free mode, as evidenced by the YouTube Summit.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was unlocked at the request of the White House.
According to them, the map on which Taiwan was allocated in a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory, was the reason.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was identified as green as free and the PRC, the PRC, Laos and Viet Nam as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screen shot, noting that the views of the panellists “not necessarily expressing the position of the United States Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese Minister may have been contrary to the “one China” policy of Washington.
One agency source stated that, after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council had made an angry connection with the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan a separate country.
The Washington Summit for Democracy took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia wasn't invited to the summit.
During the “zeroth day” of the Nobel Peace Prize summit, the editor-in-chief of the New Gazette, Dmitry Muratov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbez of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averianov, said that the summit was a “anti-Russia and anti-Chinese charge”.

You don't have to do one bunch of bad people, you may have claims about a particular matter...
But what's the number of children, age, pension fund, whatever?
Write down that they're "the creeps, they didn't pay back."
And that's how many children they have, it's none of your business until they get these kids to hang on your neck.
And since this is off, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just in education, so...
Elected (in themselves) parents dictate their rules by openly spitting on existing ones.
What if it concerns other areas of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
There are no laws for them.
What if Dad does put his education and education into practice?

MlD told us about the "winning withdrawal" between Russia and the United States
Russia's MB, Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with the Intelligence Agency, assessed the prospects for Moscow-Dington relations.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, and in some way, the prospect of improving relations is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long way that we have gone with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkova, the problems are related to the US’s desire to impose multiple approaches on Russia.
The MlD added that it would not risk providing optimistic forecasts of prospects for better relations and would not expect a change in Washington ' s position.
He explained that no progress had been made except in areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in international security matters and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned of the risk of vaccination with a COVID vaccine outside hospitals
Congested Nasal Vaccines from COVID-19 may develop allergies and require medical assistance, so the first points of use should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS virologist, correspondent member of the RA, laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirian State University of Sergei Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination sites at airports and shopping centres, but I would only do so at first resorts in health facilities.
The possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor ' s office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that function in just a minute or two, which are sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
In the view of the virologist, it would be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when experience in the use of the drug was gained.
He also stressed that it was important for the nasal vaccine to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the inoculated nose is drawn up after the injection.

In Britain, 1,239 cases of omicron strain of coronavirus - RT in Russian were recorded per day
During the days in Britain, 1,239 cases of new ocron strain infections have been detected.
That's what Sky News is informing.
In particular, 1196 new cases of omicron have been reported in England, 38 have a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of patients with COPID-19 from the new strain in Britain reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the pessimistic forecast estimated that 75,000 people could die in England by April because of the outbreak of the coronary virus caused by the omicron strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions
President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” of the country.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not to suffer,” said the official representative of the Kremlin on the TV channel Russia 1.
Peskov claims it's "understand all in the world."
Previously, it was reported that the United States considered the imposition of anti-Russian energy sanctions as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions to complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, head of Sbergbank, Herman Greff, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5% of the voters opposed independence.
The independence of France was maintained by 3.51% of the people of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99% of the ballots.
The voting rate on that day was very low, with about 55 per cent of the people in the archipelago coming to the sites.
In the view of the experts, the low appearance was due to the calls of separatists to abandon the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians in the referendum opposed the independence of France.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
Most of the inhabitants supported the founding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its property.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration of 1998 whereby the region can vote on its independence twice every two years.

WHO considers "micron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) is of the view that the “micron” is less dangerous than the delta strains of the coronary virus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the new COVID-19 option.
As of 9 December, the “micron” has been registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the omicron strain allow for a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be less difficult than in Delta, according to a WHO technical report.
The Organization notes that so far all reported cases of omicron contamination in the EU are easily or unsymptomally occurring.
However, the new strain is, according to preliminary data, faster to “delta”.
Two cases of omicron strain infection have been reported in Russia.
They “have been immunized previously”, the Gamalei Centre reported.
The head of the Supervisor, Anna Popov, stated that there was no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Green
Vadim Denisenko, Deputy High Council, listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could be left without the support of the West, as well as possible compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the perfect storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
" There is a parallel decline in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export " ...> internal protests and the opposition of the authorities to key NGs (financial and industrial groups. - Order.) " - added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation: “war against all”.
This forecast will arise in the event of a high level of turbulence in world policy, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
As a result of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership can make compromises on Donbass, which may lead to internal opposition.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position would be weakened, with the former Nardepa saying it was likely to be up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of the Greens and the President, which is likely to result in the capture of control over the force bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this crisis, Zelensky will begin the “recast of power”, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the father of the nation.
This may result in an event that will be a shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to provoke external partners to respond and to increase support for Ukraine”, Denisenko said.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or an aggressive action by Russia, according to the ex-deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an attack on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that were increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, data from the ratings poll showed that the Ukrainian President's rating had dropped to record lows, representing 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his election as Head of State.
Analysts have projected a situation in which only 21.8 per cent would vote for Zelensky in the upcoming elections, while 14.5 per cent for the country's ex-president, Petra Poroshenko.
Only 19.3 per cent of all those interviewed expressed support to the President.

Arrested for action on Red Square by a poet: "For the quote Evtushenko 10 days is given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A BSE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetvrose was written a large number of poets.
This quote belongs to writer Evgenia Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander under the administrative article on the recurrence of public action.
For the first time, he was detained on 23 January at Pushkin Square, in a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, and now, unfortunately, the interest in poetry has been lost to the decline of a culture common in Russia and the same little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag," explained Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal more detail the message.
How did the police treat you when you were in custody this time and again?
What were you asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, staff members were corrected, detained as much as possible, polite, as if it were not funny in some context of the word.
On Pushkinski, OMONOVERS were taken and taken hard.
They asked the standard, about motives.
When they heard it, in principle, they looked if it was not acceptable, it was understandable.
With the exception of all four sides of the monkey, everything was very correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I'll spend 10 days in prison.
According to protocol, speak the Tumba Jumba language alone.
At public and official events, it is spoken in the language of the surrounding community that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the mother tongue through the translator.
This protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian beautifully and nevertheless uses the help of an interpreter.
Even at official events, a stenogram of antiques is carried out by hand and a stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Researchers have shown how potatoes help to combat age disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains group B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folate and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help to function in the body's systems.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age disorders.
Thanks to the large contents of the ventricle, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract and can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis in regular use.
For the most benefit, however, the rootfruits are preferred to be dried or cooked rather than roasted on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous to diabetics as well as other high - glycemic products.
These are carbohydrates that are rapidly split into sugar, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper Kommersanta warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in their production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, a shortage of products can now replace only imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the release of "Jadex"
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, right-holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate rune sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Director-General of the Karen Kazarian Internet Research Institute.
But some -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- have managed to survive because of the regular replacement of the domain name, he adds.
For example, the Lostfilm, which is available in the search edition of both the Jadex and Google, can be seen in pirate copies of the Netflix series "Games in Calmar" and "Feeling" directed by Anna Melician, the original series of the largest video service in Russia (inscribed in the AIV).
The Kinogo, which is also available in the release of search engines, can be seen in the animated news of Encanto, but according to the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, a series of "Universal. 10 Years Later" TNT TV channels (entered Gazprom Media) is available.

Ludmila, advanced space technology is now in China.
Russia has already fallen hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - the return would be to say that Poland only reworked the idea in 1776 but developed it very effectively.
In fact, the term "Okraina - not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, doesn't make much difference.
I watched her interview, the girl said the biggest dream was that her wings would grow up, her dad would always deny her.
It's like it's all very questionable.
Well, did you get into college, and what's next?
Light bulb of Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The widest circle, framed by “molecules” of light, provides maximum uniform and bright lighting of space.
“A nuclear” or “molecular” design, reflecting the nature and nature of each object, does not lose its relevance and makes it useful to place the emphasis on the interior.
One of the characteristics of such lamps is the lack of design.
The thin, virtually invisible wires, which are regulated by height, create the feeling that the lamp is venting in the air.
Metal gold fittings and matte-white miniature ceilings will easily complement any palette, and the folding mirror and bra presented in the collection will become a ready-made ensemble to illuminate the living room, bedroom and the living room.
Well, taste and color, which is what it's called.
I really liked Tarhoon, not the current one, of course.
Very tasty were the juices in a spill of high glass cylinders.
Three servings of syrup-- overkill, my taste.
Two of them were just once.
Matras Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ulmite.
The model is comfortable with having two different surface softness – high stiffness and slightly higher average.
Only quality and premium fillers are included in the product, which have only proven themselves to be on the best side.
Springs: an independent spring block is installed at the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom that work completely autonomously.
It is their operation that gives a unique point.
The micropackage is the most common of the many spring blocks of Dimax, so it has a marked orthopaedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: A combination of corianer layers and natural latex is installed from the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If there's a latex on one surface, the other one has a coconut coy.
Such a filling tandem has long been a classic, since it transmits the mattress not only to orthopedic but also to anatomical properties.
If the coriander provides proper back support, the latex adapts the surface to the human body.
Chechole: The model is supplied in a stretching tricotal Aloe Vera.
At the customer's request, it can be made both detached and stationary.
The total height of the article is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: guarantee period of 3 years.
Matras received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm his full security and reliability in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has the CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Chamber reported on Sunday.
The objective of the five-year mission is to assess the viability of the Venus clouds and then find life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered instruments to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far it has been assumed that the Venus cloud near the Earth is too acidic for life to exist, but perhaps Venus was originally a planet of an earthly type.
A sample from Venus must arrive during the third mission.
Suppose we find life there, the main question will be whether it is earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on earth.
If different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Pausalou.

Metavelopers Change Russian Business
The topic of the meta-inhabitants became the popular autumn of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become a Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Thus, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-inhabitants and their subsequent monetaryization.
Targets should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards establishing remote interactions in a pandemic is that people are tired of disunity and restrictions.
On the other hand, business is driven by the desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models below them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitization trend, where any rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitalized.
Anya, you're right. Food change is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too fat and harmful anymore.
Of course, we're going to have a holiday and a traditional olive tree and a herring under the scab, but no one's making me eat everyone right now.
You can eat on a spoon and try and stop.
After all, it is true that ten weekends are ahead, and any delicious and useful dishes can be prepared.
And how much hell's work, time, money she needed in practice.
And with five fourths of the jumps, she's out of gold.
And she also realizes that four years before the next Olympics, she'll never make it to the Olympics.
And the one who has not merely engaged in sports or who cannot represent all the circles of hell she has been through, do NOT GO TO JUDGE.
The British economist was unable to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he believed that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the following year will be full of unpredictableness and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronary pandemic and, secondly, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increase was temporary or not.
According to the specialist, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and that it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, would correlate with the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of excessive economic policies could lead to a new surge of inflation, some experts felt.
In addition, the issue of productivity growth as well as poverty and climate change should be highlighted, O'Neill summarized.
Previously, the Head of the Global Investments Research Division, Mikhail Schulgin, reported that positive expectations for the $2022 dollar remain, with less growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar, Schulgin referred to the monetary policy of the FRF, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronary pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But the joy is that when you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago the containers were smaller.
It's better now.
There's progress, but there's nothing wrong with it.
There is still a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
Any ecotoxes that take away the waste from the house.

Russian Autodealers Gave About 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion rubles on new cars, 28 per cent more than in a similar period last year, according to Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last September that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic gross product (GDP) for 2020.
In the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
During the 10 months of this year, it was able to use 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai has an even higher growth rate of over 35 per cent, and the car sales revenue is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In the leading positions of the brand and in the increase in the weighted average price of the car - in a year, Hyundai grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger travel dynamic.
However, sales from Korean brands have not grown that much: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automotive Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia, in quantitative terms, has operated 9.4% more cars in the same period than it was a year ago.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the three sales leaders in the Japanese language, Toyota, to the cars of the brand, the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months, 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium brand has grown by 37 per cent, and the average weighted price of the car (almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million roubles).
"There is a good increase in sales and a weighted average price, for example, more than BMW, and a greater increase in the financial capacity," explained NaPI Director Tatyana Arabaji.
At the rate of sales growth, the fantastic figures show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada shows the average (plus 28 per cent) price of Russian cars spent 229.4 billion roubles on this brand in 10 months.
At the financial level last year, there are companies whose car sales fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan in particular.
In fact, in 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on non-roaders and pickups of the brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of motor components and disruptions to production that covered the entire world highway, cars continue to adjust prices continuously - the same AutoVAZ increased the value of the Lada models seven times a year, and the last trip (from 8 to 10,000 roubles) took place in late November.
Prices for their products and other auto-producers are regularly copied.
In addition to the shortage of cars, Russia ' s car market will increase in monetary terms, inflation and the desire of car concerts to win past losses are considered by experts.
In the face of a car shortage, I think that many car concerts have even been able to partially translate into consumers the costs of past periods that they were unable to place in the price of cars before,
This is analyst WTB Capital on the highway Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, car manufacturers are now feeling very well, supporting the high marginality of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars observed during 2021, prices of new cars are rising faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and complexity in the construction of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of the car is slowed down, the auto-producers will be able to earn their income from the volume, notes the independent Automobile Consultant Sergey Burghazliev.
In view of the increased demand and supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the greatest profit from each car sold, notes Burgasliev.
The increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, and in Russia the increase is further fuelled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good investment facility — a car purchased a year ago, even with running, can now be sold at a higher cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
That statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
“There have never been such plans”, the White House head said, answering a journalist's question as to whether the United States had given up such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the use of American troops unilaterally for the defence of Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Byden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would transfer forces to NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more US and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 -- all NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem of the use by Kiev of Turkish drones, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I'm leaving these interviews right now.
If they're trying to make me listen to screaming, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible barrel, and wash a cup, it's scary to see what's going to happen at work.
I'll find myself a normal place without an apricot, where you're talking to your boss right now.

If a fraud calls from a number like that, like an M.V.A. employee or other force structure, it's not effective to drop it immediately, but to blacklist it probably won't work.
Because in order to confirm his lies about his involvement in power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and negotiate.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe it was like that.
They don't know what to do, who to blame.
They've reached the Queen.
And most of all, they think it's everyone's fault, except for the most...
It would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people cared for their people.
Maybe all the strains of the virus will disappear...

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response" mean?
I'm not sounding my thoughts, I'm cursing you all.
I purposely cut off the heads of everyone who hasn't given me a seat, sent me to the cabin, and burned down all the cars that interfere with my passage, I think!
I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, Nikolai the Second in the years of his reign, has not signed a single death sentence.
Even inseparables like Koba and his brigade.
