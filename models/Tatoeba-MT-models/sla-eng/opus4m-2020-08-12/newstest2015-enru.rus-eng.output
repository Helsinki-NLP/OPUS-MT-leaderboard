FANO Russia to hold final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will hold the third Expert Session, “Assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be concluded in a series of meetings held by the Agency over the course of the year, reported in a press release published by “Lenta.Ru”.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to establish an outcome list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to establish a unified approach for all three academics to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative instruments is agreed upon.
As a result of the forthcoming session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said the head of the expert and analytical office of the FANO of Russia, Elena Aksenova.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 Russian scientific institutes.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at: Moscow City, Soljanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to find the stars.
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulence and its impact on chemical homogeneity in star formations.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow us to search for relatives, or clusters, among the stars.
The authors published the results of their studies in Nature magazine, and they can be consulted briefly on the university website.
The same chemical composition of the nearby stars is due to turbulence in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of stars.
Even if the star that was born then leaves the star cluster, it is possible to determine its birthplace and the region of the formation of the stars.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Modelling results by astrophysicists show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer specialists modeled two currents of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This facility has been transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists have added paint-tags to the initial gas flows and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to look for chemical stars and to identify possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after a high-speed motorcycle.
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven at a speed of 125 km/h in a speed limit of 70 km/h and through a bushland to hide from the Pilbar police.
A police patrol in Carrat tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, finding it speeding up to 125 km/h when it left a service station on Batgate Road.
Police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued his movement to Burgess Road, then crashed into the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and the driver’s description were seen near the home on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.

Lavrov: Russia will not “blap the door” in connection with new sanctions and will not leave WTO
Russia will not "blap the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
Today, Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov told students and teachers of MGIMO.
On the basis of our responses to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be precisely calculated," he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be about knocking on doors, some insults that are misunderstood," the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will move away from our interests, our interests, our economies, our social sphere, our citizens, our businesses, and we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners in terms of their adequacy, effectiveness and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be judged very well by the partners, as continued by the head of the RUF.
If they say in a loud voice that "they'll be painful for us too, but we have to go to punish Russia," that's probably not very appropriate."
With regard to the WTO's withdrawal from the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want to be more actively involved in WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures are being taken against the economic sectors of the Russian Federation.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU's third energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is it right to use cheese in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the following questions:
Since the cheese loses its main appeal, it is desirable to plant it with other artisans.
It combines beautifully with many cultures.
In addition to the mermaid, it is possible and necessary to plant plants that are decorative at other times as well as flowering plants at the same time.
Another plus the siren is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a stampede of different heights, an improved bush, a broad - ground bush, and even the likeness of a garden bonsai, a tree with a strangely curved trunk.
Just select the form that is more appropriate to the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a Leningrad resident is convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing activities in Olonetsk and Seghezh regions.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in the Vologodsk region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonec District Court.
In order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segejo.
In the course of the investigation, several episodes of counterfeit money sold in the summer of 2013 have been proven guilty.
At the end of June of this year, criminal proceedings with indictments were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the four-year term of imprisonment with that of the general regime.
The sentence did not enter into force legally.
Recall, two other counterfeit money dealers were convicted last week, which they paid in Petrozavodska stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of his liberty for five years, the other for four years.
Everyone was fined 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force legally.
In Archangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first Dervis convoy was celebrated.
The rally, held at the district center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis delivered military assistance from the United States and Britain to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, the memorial was held at the stake of the future monument to the northern convoys, located on the Sedova coastline in Solombala.
Representatives of the veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children of the cadet class, gathered at the event.
For the first time, we were gathered twenty - three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of memory for those who have not been returned by the sea," said the chairman of the North Sea Boat Board of veterans, Boris Karpov.
The event was followed by a city spiritual orchestra, and cadet class teachers gave flowers to veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal shoes, lead, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, there were 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines on board the vessels, 15 Harrican fighter aircraft, in a decommissioned state.
At the same time, the convoy was composed of 16 British Navy ships, two of which were carriers.
The caravan of vessels was not found by the opponent and reached the destination of Archangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 were killed and about 50 were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects the organization of trade unions as a civil law.
“Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota, co-chairing the Congress of the Progressive faction.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the Empowerment of Workers, along with the symbol of the John Lewis Civil Rights Movement.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities in discrimination against the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions
Amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to obtain compensation for damages and fines is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-sponsors of the bill are offering is to think of a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when the country was simultaneously defending democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Tojo ' s paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize and negotiate and collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that stated openly: “The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not be legally binding; measures aimed at this end will be declared unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted in 1948 by the United Nations Organization as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his own interests”.
For generations, Americans have adopted as an appropriate basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the union should be protected as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and governmental institutions.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the union movement did not undermine the power of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and have raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions are long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of Louisiana law on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed to the effect of Governor Louisiana Bobby Jinadl in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who have abortions would be obliged to have access to patients within a 30-mile radius of the hospital.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while they continue to act upon obtaining authority”, Judge John DeGrewells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled for a month on which the judge will decide more consistently on the law.
Defenders of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the last in a row of decisions against similar measures, saying that this would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“Today’s decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from a corrupt law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to suspend the law from three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admission.
Louisiana is a member of the 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures to be unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on the power of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opposers object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has access to hospital admissions, the Centre for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all the other doctors in the state were to cease to follow this procedure, the team reported that the doctor would cease to follow this procedure in the fear of his safety.
In criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors who had abortions while their applications for decision-making powers awaited.
What will result from the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trading networks should be Russian production, according to the Gosduma deputy of the Right Russia faction Oleg Nilov.
Parliamentarians have drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, reports the newspaper News.
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case for goods not produced in Russia, and according to the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of his regiments to the domestic producers," Nilov said.
Along with the amendments to the article on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the FP, the bill provides for an amendment to the Tax Code, setting a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
A few times more domestic goods will appear on the benches.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to Taxovic's lawyer, a member of the independent expert centre, the Social Duma, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy and for the domestic agricultural and food sectors, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
Plus farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the chivalry, for they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase the income of the budget, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some faster to be won, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, not immediately," the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian businesses had often not been able to access local stores because of high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market after all the necessary harmonizations and sanitation.
In other words, there is now a moment of silence when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, the demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rise in prices for finished products can be discussed," said Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian General Public Organization, the Russian Club of Financial Directors, C.E. Tamara Kasyanova.
Of course, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category would help to secure the sector by local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other, not with goods that were less expensive through subsidies from another State.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will take place among companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Cassianova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all the articles.
In this situation, trading networks will have to “retract” the proportion of Russian goods up to half the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that inadequacies will be involved.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be placed under the form of products produced in Russia," the expert adds.
Large trading networks, particularly those that benefit from cooperating with importers, are experiencing a negative effect on quota introduction.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this schedule, as demand for their products will decline.
Lithuania does not exclude that the Domestic Goods Quotas Act can affect consumers as well.
The point is that some Russian products can yield quality import analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the second, as for the deficit.
The idea of importing was again mentioned in the early 2000s by economists in February this year because of the continuing devaluation of ruble.
In the light of the difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-importation is becoming even more relevant.
The Act is intended to oblige retellers to be considered with domestic producers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will move much faster and more confidently on the way to import, and the production planning system will be created in a shorter time," said the deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where capacity is particularly high, for example in the milk sector, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are indeed able to fully cover Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can be a powerful force.
It is known that the highest percentage of imports are kept on beef, ranging from 30% to 35%.
It is true that 65 to 70 per cent are still Russian products," says Kasyanov.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate and may accelerate the import process.
However, this initiative will not in itself replace it, as it requires a set of measures, which Lithuania is confident of.
In any event, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad and thus no full replacement would occur, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
In addition, quotas were limited, and domestic production was still needed to meet those quotas.
These quotas provide such guarantees," the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovary cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their dead mother’s memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the likelihood of dying in a study is 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
SEVERAL RESEARCH: New medicines can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current illness and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
While the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distances, she suggested that an increase in the number of services on the way out, which would enable professionals to treat women closer to home, and programmes to support people who were being treated far from home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquercancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elish Niv, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in the Kugener region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibeljak was initiated in April of this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Public Communications and Information Office of the Head of the Ministry of Education, funding for the construction of the facility was provided through the Republic budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the built treatment facility is almost 230 square metres.
There will be medical care for the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Tokteibeljak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraibelak, Shinur and Chaskaal.
The new field office will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its premises do not meet the sanitation requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
A four-month-old son killed in a state of impertinence will be brought to justice
The Cheshii resident will be on the bench for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksar, the investigation of the criminal case against 31-year-old Novoceboxarska resident accused of causing the death of recklessly.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused and his four-month-old son attended the birthday of their best man in Cheboxara.
After a long table, a new boxer decided to stay with her and put the child to bed.
When the boy woke up at night and wept, the impetuous woman put him next to her on the bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman attacked her son, causing him to die of strangulation.
The criminal case, reported the press service of the SSC in Chushia, was sent to the court.
Inflation has come out of vacation.
Do Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-cutting sanctions, RF and West inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to meet government projections, WTB Capital analysts are convinced.
In the view of experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes the Daily RBC.
According to the latest forecast for Mineconomy, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, and in the following year less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the Kommersanta newspaper, this week the MEAs should make “small but principled” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower inflation estimates for 2015, thus eliminating the expected dwindling of population income.
The forecast was that the RF's food sanctions were in effect one year before August 2015.
How could such inflation have been assumed?
The current situation is a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said a newspaper source in Minfin.
Economists from the World Bank Capital do not share the Government's financial and economic bloc's expectations of inflation and predict an 8 per cent price increase in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will be the possible introduction in the regions of the RF of a sales tax (NSP) in 2015, convinced by experts.
Inflation peaks of 9% will have to take place in February, followed by a decline in annual price growth, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat failed the first inflation results after the RF imposed "cautious sanctions".
Aif.ru asked the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analysis Department of FC AForex:
Price growth has already been observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products were valued, the Government had to initiate measures to systematically monitor price stability in order to prevent undue price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and routers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, is initiating price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflows, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulationist, the internal conversion due to population flight into foreign currency, and the embargo on imports of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of a basket of minimum product sets would not have risen by 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food products has led to a shock in the domestic market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since we are currently unable to fully launch the mechanism of import replacement and to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the response will continue to bear the risks of rising the inflationary component.
Adding fiscal reasons for a lack of confidence in national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could well exceed 8 per cent.
Alexander Razwayev, Director of the Alpari Analytical Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached between 20 and 30 per cent per month; in zero it was also above the current level; in other words, it was offset by rapid economic growth.
As a result of the year, inflation is estimated to be between 8 and 8.5 per cent.
Plato Maguta, managing the assets of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has been successfully suppressed, but if there is a further increase in pressure, especially on the financial sector, it may lead to some difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually shown in cash purchases in order to secure their savings.
The Government, the CBF and the Ministry of Finance may be expected to seek to mitigate the smooth weakening of ruble, both by market methods and by public regulation.
But price increases begin traditionally after summer silence and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target of 7.5 per cent consumer inflation in Russia is likely to stand because the RF still has financial savings.
Sadowice centres suffer from a decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of households under the age of 35, could lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds per year by planters, when today's young consumers reach the “primary age of gardening”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, people who take housing spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting backyards in front of the house for parking and the reduction of garden size as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of landlords has dropped from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level in Britain spends on household goods for gardeners.
HTA and the Royal Soaring Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the head gardener at the RHS, said, "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden century” of retail trade in vegetable products as a result of an increase in the number of landlords and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year through better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
Bulgaria's Ministry of Agriculture conducted a mass cleaning at the Land Agriculture Fund
Three of the four heads of the Earth Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Earthenware Foundation were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture has only reported the abolition of the post of Executive Director, Atanas Dobrev.
His place was in Lausanne Vasilev.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three alternate executive directors of the Fund had been quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelov, who has been responsible for State aid and the SAPARD programme, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I did not attend the fund ' s board because we are not members of the management by law, but I was informed later that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal isn't reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to know more on Monday," Angelov said.

Turkey calls on US diplomat to report on espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the highest American diplomat in the country to explain the report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Buelent reported that the US case commissioner and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet Journal The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey had been a priority intelligence target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reduced the importance of this communication, saying that all leading countries are spying on each other.
The previously reported information that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankara a target of intelligence has led to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
China's largest companies united against Alibaba
China's largest commercial real estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group, and Internet giant Tencent Holdings (socsets, Messengers, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Aliba.
However, catching up on the miracle of Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
The Union of the Greatest
Companies are planning to invest 5 billion Yuan ($814 million) in a joint venture, 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each Internet company, according to Wanda Group.
It is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with some 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 fancy hotels, Wanda manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of cinema and the theme park in Cindao (the city of eastern China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and make a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the U.S. AMC Entertainment Holdings cinema network, making the company the world's largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all her shopping centres, hotels and entertainment facilities with e-commerce services, which will be developed by Aliba's newly created competitor.
According to Dun Tse, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of e-commerce users from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract customers on the Internet to come to ordinary offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon sales services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," said Wanda Van Jianlin (Bloomberg quote).
“There is currently no current O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are roughly equal”, he believes.
The Chinese Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates it will increase by more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, resulting in Bloomberg ' s official statistics: that is more than any country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
Head Tencent Ma Huaten was China's richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already overtaken him for $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes in his share of Alibaba.
Baidu Robin Lee is now third in China's wealthiest people, while Van Jianglin of Wanda is fourth in line.
“It’s very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge even richer people,” said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce Research in Hanzhou Tsao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba as soon as it is created: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not so simply competing with not only new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is evidenced by the recent report on the financial performance of Alibaba in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, Chinese companies have earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba ' s net profit over the period is almost twice the same aggregated rate of competitors - it has grown almost three times the annual figure of $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has enormous potential for money generation, thanks largely to its mobile applications,” commented Bloomberg, a Hong Kong analyst from the Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated prospectus on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly above the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all transactions made by Alibab during the past quarter were made by mobile devices.
Alibaba needs to be named the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the debut of Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on 16 September.
The road-show company preceding this event will start on 3 September.
Alibaba's exit to IPO is expected to be record-breaking in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the United States stock exchange record has belonged to the Visa payment system, which conducted its initial deployment in 2008, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in trade networks should be Russian production, according to Gosduma deputies.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
This is a change to article 8 of the FZ on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the FF and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce safeguards against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, should be made for at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in winter, so they will be reduced to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent for all food products originating in Russia, reports the newspaper News.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower chamber of Parliament amending the Retail Markets Act, which proposes to restore agricultural markets in Russia where small producers will be able to implement their products.
Magaluf Police Chief is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Attorney General of Mallorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Malorca resort island was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notoriously well-known shopping mall of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street on which most bars and nightclubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online publication, the plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police and officials of the Municipality of Calvia to the office of the Malorca Prosecutor for Combating Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the guards of the National Guard of Spain in connection with allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on their business situation.
"The point is no longer to earn money, it is to survive," one businessman told the court.
Our sources cannot be jeopardized.
We've got nothing to lose.
This summer, the Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press after a popular YouTube video featuring an 18-year-old British rester who passed 24 men during a bar run.
Since then, the island's authorities have been trying to put an end to bullying among the restless Magalufs, bringing to a minimum the number of scandalously known liquor bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magaluf Tourist Resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the site of numerous alcohol-intoxicating accidents known as “balconing” when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, with torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell into the city by 9 p.m., after 6.6 mm, which fell out on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a few short rainstorms, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had released the early spring meal last week, the temperature had dropped again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The harsh conditions are supposed to have served as a reason for the delay in landing the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but fell into the wind zone - a sudden change in the speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and had to gain altitude.
Windwaves reached 50 km/h on land at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane finally landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused a subsequent delay in several other flights, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday, with a probability of one or two castings.
The calculation of construction facilities in the RF will be updated
Price issues, regulation of the construction industry, as well as networking issues, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service has taken special control.
The FAS has established an expert board for building competition.
At its meeting, the head of the management of the control of JCX, construction and natural resources, FAS, Vadim Soloviev, stated that “the current calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is totally unclear”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and could lead to an unreasonable cost of construction, according to the FAS.
And they offer the cost of constructing individual facilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, constructive solutions instead of the currently applied estimates and unit costs for technological operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are now under consideration in the Minister.
“The replacement of traditional estimates in construction for the calculation of constructive elements should result in less corruption in the industry,” explained Wadim Soloviev, “WGB”.
Because now every bolt and hook is accounted for, and it doesn't always seem possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unconscionable construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
The FAS master agrees.
“The first work on the conversion of value by design elements is already in place: methodologies have been developed to calculate prices for constructive solutions, to calculate estimates for these indicators,” said the head of the Department of Urban Activities and the architecture of Minister Elena Žukov.
The area of road construction has been selected as pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is far more serious.
As the head of the Profi-Invest construction company, Anatoly Demyanco, explained, the estimates have long been outdated, but no other mechanism has yet been proposed for business.
“As far as the proposed design calculations are concerned, this is not feasible in practice, since buildings often use very different technologies”, he believes.
It's not a secret that the structure develops in many ways thanks to the state warrant.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chairman of the NP Executive Board, the “Expert Community of State Professionals”, today the State is the most able-bodied employer.
The Under-Secretary for Engineering of the Rosatom Capital Capital Centre, Vladimir Malakhov, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies with access to the portfolio of contracts and companies with monopoly competences that do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was restricted to the maximum of the control of someone.
On the expert board, it was suggested that the State Treasury system should be established in such a way that the same contractor was not entitled to receive more than one contract of more than 1 billion rbs or several contracts of more than 1 billion rbs.
The Minister believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business and the efficiency of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukov, in this case it would be necessary to assign the client to the functions of the general contractor, which would result in an increase in the number of the client and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the client will have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations and their safety.
Often, such a breakdown would need to determine who would be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified purchasers due to the lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The Expert Advisory Centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Evstashenkov, believes that the procedure for the execution has now become a business game for the care of the contractor.
The example was given by: “the participant should specify “specific indicators” without the words “or equivalent”, “should be”, “more”, “less”, “an analogue”, “or”, “type”, “not less”, “not less”, “over”, “may”, “may be”, “maybe”, “ earlier”, “not earlier”, “not above”, “not above”, “not permitted”,” etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another issue of 44-FZ, Evstashenkov believes, was the need to assess the quality of work at the application stage through a “paper” proposal from the participant.
In considering the participant's application, it is only possible to assess the qualifications of the contractor but not the quality of the work that has not yet been done, according to the expert.
The quality of work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert board also suggested that marginal income be transferred from the upper to the lower echelon to disappear intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary of State, of the Fas Andrey Zharikovsky, believes that it is not worth doing, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, as in the famous Arcadia Rajkin rerun of Atele: "Is there a claim button?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when missiles and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the Territory was recovering after the hostilities.
The start of schooling has brought joy and excitement to the rocket victims of southern Israel ' s settlements, but the traces of hostilities have remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pashosh children's garden, where the rocket hit, took the traces of fragments from the walls and the children's hills before the students arrived.
"We are a little scared, but we are happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to life of greatness.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she suddenly started going back to school a little weird.
"It was a difficult time, and we did not leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuben Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of border settlement residents, such as Saad, did not go outside or leave their homes, moving to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many Nahal Oz residents, settlements near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderota, a city on the border from Gaza, which had been greatly exhausted by the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas requirement to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down his weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates from the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; nevertheless, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this allegation.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines in Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people were sheltered in more than 100 schools that had been turned into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, officials responsible for education postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy now living in a Gaza school.
According to the popular criteria, real estate prices have shown the highest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing cost index for Australian capital housing prices increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase in June, July and August by 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than double the increase of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Loless reported that Sydney and Melbourne have a two-level market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne prices rose by 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government expenditure reductions were incurred, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per annum.
Mr. Loless said that now that spring had begun, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items put on sale within a few months, which would be a “current test” for the market.
“Considering the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales speed and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise over the next three months”, he said.
How people live in the old house of Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners of Evdokima and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Grand Kazanska) 18 apartments.
The home of the 18th century has remained virtually unchanged since the construction of the building, if not for the sake of magnificence.
Foreigners come here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege of living in an elderly Ufim house whose walls are remembered by the general Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the construction of the house is incorrect, and historians point to two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is not under 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, creaking stairs.
The doors to the apartments are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the lights are open to the streets.
Seems like everything's on the up and up.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in an 18th - century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukyanov, a resident of Apartment No. 3.
The object is in the state, but the money for its contents has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still hard-core, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street and wash once a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be content with such conditions?
The road goes right under the windows, there's no pedestrian zone.
Tatyana's pulling the curtain.
Now you can see that before that, there's a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are always dreary, the windows can't be opened, and they're used to the noise.
But man is accustomed to all things, good and bad.
Our apartment is still modeling, thank you husband, his hands are gold.
What's more, we have two rooms, three of us with our son.
In other families, conditions are much worse, and on the second floor, the ceiling is slightly more than one and a half feet [1.5 m] high.
For the contrast of Tatyana, she proposes to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 by Ludmila Starostina.
A pleasant, hospitable woman at the door offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live together: my husband and daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since birth, and there's never been another place to live, and Ludmila's been rounding the room with her eyes: antressols, two couches with the letter "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
It's very close and very little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But from the ceiling it flows regularly: the plumbing system is nowhere to be found.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as unusually and surprisingly at the same time as an Italian woman whose home is in Roman ruins.
That is, one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was conducted some 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a little kitchen in a corner and a toilet from an ex-chulan.
We live right where Demid and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, so why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, it is said that privatization is irrelevant.
We'll get a one-bedroom apartment anyway, we can't claim any more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move, but the promise did not go away.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flyer, they're three feet thick!
They say the solution was involved in the eggs, which is why it's taking so long.
The house is well built, thank the Demids!
That's probably why she didn't kill anyone with a collapsed ceiling or a swath.
It's just that the building is still slowly dying in front of us: the boards and the logs are rotting at home, the fields are failing, we're pouring cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is under our secret lasagna room and the passage to the White River, which has been specially made by the old-timers here so that they can hide from danger, in case of which.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged him to let him start at the dig's apartment.
And then he convinced them to give up their living space in exchange for his unit on October's prospectus.
Sophia refused:
Where are we at four o'clock?
And here there's a little hope that they'll give the place a little bit more space.
We agreed to trade, we wouldn't win any more.
After all, the Seniors' family won nothing.
Ludmila's greatest dream of being resettled, and her 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
That is, for two families, a two - room apartment was allocated instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
The attractive, miniature girl, Olesia Karsakova, from apartment Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There are two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, with a large family.
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see the conditions.
The plaster is rolled down with pieces, like the window frames, in the kitchen walls and in the rooms through the holes.
The tap's only cold for a year.
Walking around the apartments of the old house of Ufa, you can be sure that most of them were lucky enough for the husbands of Lavrenty from Apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
75 square square meters, three persons prescribed.
We live in the very rooms where Suvorov has been legendically stopped during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitryevich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing, everybody's shivering at the seams, falling apart, falling apart.
The neighbors must have already told me!
The most torture we have is with the floor: the wooden boards are rotten, the ground is literally falling from under our feet.
I've set up the rails, the kid; there's nothing left in the hall, and in the other room we walk, like we're rolling on the roller coasters, it's so thin.
The house of the merchant Evdokima Demidova, Alexander Dmitryevich, can tell the better of any tour guide.
He treats the gold industry as a relative, speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the identity was inconvenient: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyan factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The heirs of the property are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitryevich.
There were wooden carriages, stables, and coaches that were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something got in the way...
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again deluded.
As a team, we collected all the documents, went around the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments was being carried over to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The tenants didn't accept it.
They sent from one table to another, and then, in mockery, they issued a paper without signature and stamp, "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the tenants."
I even felt like our house was long gone from the city, because first it was number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like he was demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet referred to the head of the information and analysis sector of the Land Administration of Ufa Vladimir Barabas.
The House on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the resettle programme.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the '70s, only I know that there was a plan at the time to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
The tenants are soon scheduled to settle in new apartments.
According to Barabbas, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
An architectural biennale is now being held in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is being presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Casana Street will be restored,” the official said.
Houses will become the right kind of place that was three centuries ago.
The house of Demidova is likely to become a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, too much traffic in the city will not be achieved in the wake.
The relocation of people from the future museum of Vladimir Barabas is promised in 2015.
After all, they are not going to be satisfied with their new apartments.
It's just from another era.
A forest fire broke out in Primorje
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the area of the hunting ground forest in the Požar region of the Primorsk region.
There is a build-up of forces and funds at the site of the fire.
According to the management of the CCSA, the conditions at the scene of the fire require the involvement of the air force.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Airbase:
A fire in a difficult area detected an observer aircraft from the An-2 patrol ship on an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood residue on the old burner.
The severe deceleration of the territory and the rigidity of the slopes of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landings of the fire-fighting areas, create considerable difficulties in the fighting.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of airbase services by Mi-2 and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, four fire bombers were rapidly released.
The main task of specialists is to put out the fire and prepare a site for additional firefighting and firefighting.
In the area of lunch, three helicopters were additionally delivered to the area of the village of Hunters.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the site of the fighting, reported to the Primorsky Krajina Administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing a comedy called Rudi's Rare Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4.
Soundtrek is a mixture of reggae and rap, and melodies are lifelike.
Henry, however, had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often thinks about his father's relationship.
He was very unavailable.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice say, "Stop talking.
Stay away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about such things as the form of a beer glass, the beauty of the cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such an impertinent guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Recently, Henry opened a lithium workshop in Dudley and, although conditions had become better than his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smokey, the depths of the maze with the outbreaks of fire and smoke and soot dogs.
My father went into the bathroom and he was just lying there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash himself away from a casting workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to make us some money, and I came to appreciate it more.
Henry, however, came out of childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It's only when my mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well, and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And that's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career path shift may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he was recognized as a critic for his Otello, he's been completely down in the theater.
The comedy mistake followed, and then August Wilson's "Forgettings."
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which have been an integral feature of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parody on stage, and he wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-'70s: "For quite a long time I was the only black parodytist/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the audience, I had to learn to be an effective car for the 1975 and 1985 jokes, as a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Persons" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people blacked their faces, Henry discovered that he had been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I mean, I don't think it's ever gonna be with me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody on black people”.
Introducing characters who were mocking and singing the culture of black people in Britain, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as, among other things, the chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy show "The Boss!"
The commercials, documentary films, TV shows and movies took him the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC show in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling time or quietly turning away."
Then there was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good about...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't say I'm being taught so much at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of the middle-class white people with the collars and the cappuccinos in the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, they said, "You should try it.
Don't make fun of it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and he was caught.
I felt like I could do it.
It's like my head was straightened out.
"Here's what this is, it's a serious matter, taking it seriously, studying your text, doing a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read that play months and months before we put it up.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Comedy of Mistakes".
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was this moment where I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his cause was to entertain the audience.
"The silent voice inside me said, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes while they're running a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Forgettings" at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to study the text for the "Removals".
Panic is quite helpful, it strengthens the muscle.
She was well received, too, so it was like a sign above that said, "That's what you need to do."
He says it with a thunderous voice, of course.
So I'm holding on to that.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry's still thinking of a comedian -- our entire conversation is interrupted by the flashes of his humor, and when he starts, he ends up parody.
I just decided not to work on the stand because this thing with the instant reward of a full room of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at the direct air in Apollo when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to get.
I'm asking if he'll ever give a tour of the stand again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road -- I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove the “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in government structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700000) per month was lost through payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that wages continue to enter bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri of the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must appear in identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through biometric registration procedures, is reported in a government statement.
Any person who does not do so without due respect will be deleted from the payment statement, it shall be reported.
“This procedure significantly facilitates the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of the Government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Weighur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police are arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a “conspiracy against the Government” reported by local information agencies.
The police did not comment on this information immediately.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in activities to identify corruption in the past December, which was aimed at verifying government personnel, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fathullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after summer vacations.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yacinyuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on September 1st.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastuhov, director of the school in Slavansk, where Jacinyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
On the first day of school, children traditionally wear embroidered shirts, hold air balloons, and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by the fame of the world of banking, media management and the internal circles of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in decision-making.
Her career began in the global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when Pearson's senior executive position was held by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband's former counsellor, Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the Chairman of the poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but it has an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is an almost elusive duopoly that needs complete radical reform.
However, what a new president would risk coming, melting and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself lost his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size, once its powers, finances and status have been reviewed.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of the license pose a particular risk to the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in the world's largest media enterprise.
The BBC is telling a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and stand for only 40 p per day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb’s popularity is increasing: 53 per cent support it today against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The BBC view and use models have changed: I now receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president, I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside.
The tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas's Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats, who is at the centre of prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the recording was disavowed.
I just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone outside.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it off," says a later record.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the comments requested.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing in that tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unkind cartoon for the Travis Rosemary Lemberg district prosecutor, who was found guilty of drinking in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her department when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of drunkenness, three times the permissible level of blood alcohol, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry with what he tells me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg didn't investigate the grand jury against Perry.
They had Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who had been appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the charges a political conspiracies.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who served longer than anyone in the history of Texas, would be vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County, and is pursuing corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto has made an official complaint from a left-wing control group.
Perry's confirmed account tape is often updated, and sometimes it becomes famous.
After arriving at the fifth party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumours that he could get out of the game by publishing a tweet of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to “normal”
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital were subject to lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose mortgage lending restrictions in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013,” adding that this has provided “a stable working environment”.
London ' s real estate market succeeded during the downturn, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Inventory, significantly overrun the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “pattern tax” before the general elections in next May.
Last week, the London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, which imposed stricter loan conditions, would also reduce market growth, both in real estate and in prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting a further cooling on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising prices for London's real estate for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that the set of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital was very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales volume above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added, "The demand for good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the sales have continued for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April -- almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking before the company's annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pidgely said that Berkeley's projected income for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to a unanimous opinion by analysts, profits are expected for the whole year before taxes are paid in the amount of £450 million.
Berkeley's stock was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked published online by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted online by a hacker who assures us that he has a catalog of 100 more rising stars.
A representative of the Star of the Hungry Games confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for "sudden invasion into private space".
There has been an appeal to the law enforcement authorities, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained from the lack of an Apple iCloud online feeding system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the break-in included dozens of female celebrities, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photographs are true, although Scott Pilgrim's star against all of them, Winstead also condemned the break-in on Twitter.
"The one who's looking at the photos that my husband and I took a few years ago, alone at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, from Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria-Victor" series, denied that she had tweeted on the photos, saying, "These are the so-called photos of the false people who have nakedd me.
Let me stop it in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a pop star representative, Ariane Grande, had denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be true.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and the letter "J", which praised critics
They were dissolved, most likely to say so, gradually falling apart, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in him.
He was like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thorn was a little novel from which he expected more than usual to be saved from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a shaky, fragile beauty with hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the last to inherit a house in raw but paradise-like valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat motionless in the baths, the mucus left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden grew weeds like giant cabbages.
It was like a kid's book cottage, both scary and charming, with a whole secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel is included in the booklist of the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Keverne and Aileen sat, holding hands, in broken lounges in the middle of the high grass, enjoying the sudden warm spring day; they both scatteredly joined the cheap console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when he looked at her crossed brown legs and remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer whom his father loved to listen to by dropping the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their aggression, the songs of this type on the consoles were no longer lost.
They were not banned - nothing was actually prohibited - they were no longer lost.
They were helped to become archaic, just like the word "archive."
Public taste did what would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books people chose memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, culinary books, and romance novels, they chose ballads from all over the music.
With the excitement of that day, Keverne began to play the imaginary piano and to sing the big legs of Eileen with a rough comical voice.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically attaching two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she landed from his mouth.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew he was expected, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz wasn't played either, even though it wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation is out of style.
There's only one place left in life if there's only one "if."
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
That's exactly the same with the wit.
His unpredictability worked on people's nerves.
And jazz was an austere expression of music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 and had never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Keverne knew about jazz from his father's semisecret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she could hardly remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
Society was obedient, and this meant that each segment agreed with the principle of group predisposition — thanks to those who were preserved by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited to entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.
The natives of Indonesia, as if of nature, were talented in everything related to electronics, made sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what was left of the Greek diaspora was plates.
The Persians and Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when what had happened had occurred to them in general, in fear of being accused of burning the flames, in fear of being consumed by the flames, in fact, by the following, opening restaurants with swans and callies, and not being sucked out and yearned for nothing.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that Keverne had just uttered could have been put to music.
Music is the expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Keverne.
Unless it's for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden he was running gave him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant cabbagelike leaves.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love such a thing?
He was going to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her again.
She thought he was weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She mistrusted her head by closing Keverna's review.
All over the world, there was nothing but the land of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big a leg?
He looked at them again.
You can't say, no.
The ankles, maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you just because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so sick of it.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to make jokes often put him in awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the calming reassurance that could alleviate the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too, Keverne.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the shellon, tossing the console and pouring the wine they were drinking.
The wine from the cheek, so the intoxication couldn't have been his excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Although you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her and for the harshness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold north archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she looked like the present one.
The same huge ice ocean hit them both.
The same men, even more sensitive and captivating after what happened, if in general occurred than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to deny them or irritate them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, they would kiss - the kiss was now the most common expression of erotic annoyance between a man and a woman; the anti-eating of fresh ballads that the console had issued - to kiss her first and then to hit her.
In Keverne’s opinion, the unnecessary clarification is that kissing yourself was already hooliganism.
Aileen Solomons has shown the Corps that he must leave.
He got out of the lounge like an old man.
She felt the heavyness of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man who was self-inflicted.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought.
She felt the sting of compassion for him and the men in general, even though some of them raised their hands on her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back shut, shy, beaten, all the power to fight left him -- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any of the cases until today when she saw it?
Once again, Aileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or around the events described above, Esma Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Offnau, an informal public mood monitoring service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the same parts of the country, where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop completely, taking into account the means and forces that had been devoted to its eradication.
“A lot has been done and much is done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the inborn aggression of people who have fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow settlements of the area, where despite the burning towers of churches, the gentle breathing of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities appear to be inexorable.
The higher the deck, the lower the passions it breeds.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows the stories of overcome obstacles, and announces its belief in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness retain its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence of new and vicious harassment in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said her scientific leader, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," replied Esma Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "crushy" others would be interpreted as an expression of natural life and vigor.
To continue to be bored about what happened to her in general, as if it had happened, if at all, yesterday meant depriving the country of its vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinowitz spoke.
For his head pink, like flamingo, the LED letters repeated the advice that Ofnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, value your husband, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation better than silence, a word better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," Esma Nussbaum quietly replied, when she made sure that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't healed as effectively as we can convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that initially led to what happened, if any.
Only this time will we cast our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips in a pyramid.
This gesture was to mean endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling the "mistakes" of actions that our grandfathers did or didn't do.
You go too far and you talk about how they threw their anger and their mistrust at others.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, in understanding the past, by protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There was no "us" and there was no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself," she dared to insert Esma, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done is done.
There was a time.
There's nothing more to say - we agree here.
And if you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it's appropriate or if there's anything you can do to make it right.
But why the past, if not for learning,
The past will be for us to forget.
If I may add one word to this -
The pyramid of Luther the Rabbiess is broken.
"I will examine your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a biker who went out on the sidewalk, as described by the passerby, "in an angry rage".
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho Army states that no coup was planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho ' s representatives denied the preparation of a coup to overthrow the Government, saying that they had acted against the police, suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded its official residence and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attempt on his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, the army representative, said that there was no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat of “political fanatics” whom the police had tried to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were willing to cause chaos,” he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monilla, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed power from the armed forces of Lesotho, it is reported that the actions of the Lesothoan armed forces are at present the main signs of the coup,” he said.
Representatives of the Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing manages the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Taban suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his united Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite the charges against the contrary.

The euro area output slowed to the lowest 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the euro area production sector for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses were affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) took place on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with the suspension of the recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation in inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that ECB leader Mario Draghi can give additional signals later this week, that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The PMI of the production sector of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest mark in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be as concerned as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum of the carnage, mainly the industrial engine, Germany and Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to further fuel oil to analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist of the IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about August's survey of the euro area business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension, especially related to Russia/Ukraine, adds uncertainty to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and probably leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like" that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it will be limited."
Mariupol's people will put out a live chain against militia
In Mariupola, until last week, everything was calm - no one was fighting to organize the people’s Republic of Mariupoli, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the residents are horrifyingly awaiting the arrival of the militia.
According to a version of the political scientists, separatists break into Mariupol to get to the Azov Sea, recently the city of Novoazovsk, which had not been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols have decided that the Ukrainian army will protect them, but it has little against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and have assembled to assist the military.
They're digging trenches, building roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city and stood up in a lively chain, singing the hymn of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish newspapers.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten years of hell for survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the horrendous takeover of school, as children who have been in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day test that rocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school
Just ten years after the terrible takeover of Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
The tragedy brought together the East and the West in disgust, which miraculously then turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of a terrible tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
A girl who's trying to get back in the shooting gym.
It was sealed on a picture of a famous Russian photographer named Dmitry Belyakow trying to get back in one of her underwear to the shooting sports hall after the mine exploded.
Aida was desperate to find her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run with all my might, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked it up and took it to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There's a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly did not break it," she said with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and that fact cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too severe.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says that the seizure remains with her, although the memories are a little vague every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our distresses, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and from all over the world.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I go to the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, find out about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, thinking that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians started school at 7 years of age) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mother told me to lie down if there's an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Go away."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw the weeping little boy on the road, grabbed the child by the arm, and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I have not been able to save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and hospitalized with injuries on her feet, thinking that her son had died.
When they were reunited, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
The lady was later brought to London (now existing News of the World), where he was awarded as Child Protector of the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
After all, I can tell you that I have a memory of him.
I remember throwing away all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and a ride in an open-ended car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who did volunteer work at the women's monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve with the police someday, and I hope to be enrolled at the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings and can support us.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the pineapple, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has gotten any better in 10 years.
Now there's a war going on in Ukraine, people dying every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to be remembered, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it, and I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph, after the capture, became decisive for the Beslan tragedy
Peace: Former Beslan Georgie Ilyn and his mother Fatima after the 2004 takeover, and Georgia's right today
There was a scar on his bloody face when he was rescued from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists fled to the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of nightmares," she recalled.
Not alone, our family was there, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It enters the soul: the photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie wanting to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of weeping Georgie in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand, but I also think that this photo makes people around the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she's been caused by?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, because that's what's happening?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need it to take decades to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the excitement, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget that, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to be a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Amazing: Georgi Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the seizure, but he survived.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a terrorist-killer bomb.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said George, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer at the FSB, but failed because of the damage he suffered during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to cope with, and I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
I wish I'd forgotten.
In 2005, for the next year, I was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with an open laptop photo of himself in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all the animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and it's not what they have to survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark her.
I know Georgie won't.
For him, it has to be even stronger because he was there, and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't play sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent over this nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift that God could ever give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him at the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only we could catch all the rebels and throw them away as far away as possible.
Alena Tskaev, 10 years old
A young man who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alan Tskaev is being taken to a safe place by the Russian Special Forces (left).
Now she's ten, and she doesn't even remember a monster crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian police officer took little Allen out of the captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christina's ten-year-old sister and Brother Mahar in the gymnasium.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alan’s mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter that he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, now ten, remembers nothing about her captivating and blossoming into a smart and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They're a great happy family now, and Alana and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a magnificent father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Xinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, noted that he looked forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
He said this transfer was a happy career event.
Of course, I am very glad to be playing for the Borusia again, the Bild of the words of Kagawa.
I feel very good.
It's a lot of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to going out on the field again in the form of "Borussia".
Recall, Kagawa moved to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to fit into the English club, spending two seasons of only 38 matches in the England Championship, beating six balls and giving eight effective handovers.
A man accused of raiding a girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought before a court on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly beat up a girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East New York.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and knocked the girl out of harm's way.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in Dundee's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, appointed the trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland will not be loaded in Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport duty-free store of Vladivostok has placed a table prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in the store.
Don't load them with ghosts, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angela Merkel, President of France François Allland, Vitaly Klitschko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other known associates would not be able to load vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And put the right plate on the door.
Earlier, Obama had been banned from being even less accessible to him as a member of the Dietary Meals Institute, as reported by the general inquiry website.
Whether the President of the United States has ever dreamed of eating in a diet in Russia, it is unknown, but the authors of the bans seem to be terribly insidious.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Bear gave advice to agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that new technologies should be adopted in the embargo for Russian agriculture to produce the raw materials used by buyers.
The Council was given during a visit to Southticeprom by Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the restorers to re-orient themselves to Russian meat of good quality.
The annual food import embargo has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of Russia's assembly Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparations for the competition.
Our athletes spoke at their own level, bringing in the All Sport words of Maslakova.
The third is the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we have not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have updated our team.
The French, on the other hand, put on a combat team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was publicly announced.
But even such a composition could not resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken at such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were less orderly than in the same Brilliant League.
Season's over.
Of course, the result is no longer so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, it was absurd when 1,500 metres of men were so involved in tactical maneuvers that they showed a result below the average... of women's races.
4 tips on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video underwater, you've got a whole bunch of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight soapshop, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules must be followed to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery and other cells are sealed off.
In addition, set up your camera for the kind of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras have imaging modes or object types that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off a few of your staff, because many of them can't.
The soap operas have CDs that will help you compose the photos, while the action cameras usually don't have them.
Even if you have a CDB, it's going to be hard to see underwater, and it's going to be a random process.
So do some personnel.
Also, if your camera has a serial recording mode that takes out a few people with a few different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced than you can dive deeper under the water.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in the pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to transfer more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Take a closer look at the shooting sites.
It's a great advice for filming on land, but it's even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
It's especially important if you're filming on an action camera: It's often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get close to the objects if you want to fill in the footage.
The 2012 Olympics Bronze Prize winner Bilal Mahov may enter the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the head coach of the Sazid Sazidov Free Fight Congregation in Dagestan.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bilajal Mahov is currently at the gathering of the “classics” team, which introduces the “R-Sport” of Sajid Sazidov.
In fact, Bilal spoke in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he won the tournament of volunteers and the third prize in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free fight.
It was a long time ago that a new phase of our careers would take place in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can already perform at the Tashkent World Championship if he wins the prank.
But the decisive word is always behind the training headquarters headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose strength could have swept everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consultant anesthesiologist devoted his career to the relief of the sick, both from the suffering of the disease and from the suffering of the treatment.
Among those who approached him was his wife, an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctor was involved in the diagnosis and disease, those undergoing the treatment were mostly concerned about something completely different: pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began suffering.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
When he struggled with flu - like symptoms, he discovered that he was exasperating his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found that he was unusually and inconceivably upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affected the pleur or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact reason.
Although some smokers suffer from lung cancer, for example, not all patients with lung cancer have smokers.
But it's different with the mesothelioma.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fiberous building material that was once called a miracle, but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be overlooked.
Asbestos, after all, material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals from specific industries worked closely with it: pipelines, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
There are more people dying of mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
At annual deaths of approximately 2,500, more than twice as many people die from this disease than car accidents.
Annual Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that although asbestos has been used unlawfully for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the mesothelioma attack is not limited to the veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, set up in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, the level of wealth, the profession or age.
The electoral bastions, from fashionable London universities to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The building of Parliament is permeated with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a troupe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get in touch with asbestos.
Then he behaved.
"It is said that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the hospital of Gaia, where I spent six years in the internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and freighters used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers are going to get the same disease?
It was a question that he had unfortunately been able to give a partial answer to.
“Of the four doctors who were interned at Gaia Hospital and who subsequently developed a mesothelioma over the last five years”, he noted in a letter in 2010, “I was the only one left alive.”
How many of us are going to get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now all we can do is repeat the question of "How many of us are going to be sick?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain must survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people now don't think they're going to die like this.

A quick examination of court reports, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been exposed to asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing department on two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before it happened," she said, "I've never heard of a mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even think it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They were named after the word “asbestyform”, which means a fiber structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is more common in buildings today.
It was used in blood panels, shallow tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, metal sutures, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as “a serious source of health damage”, which could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of patients with mesothelioma [in Britain]”.

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of the mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or at home, is likely to be caused by the effects of asbestos from the environment”.
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the “normal use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which dealt with the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the very centre of the Government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees had been infected with asbestos, which could be driven by deadly fibers as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems quite the opposite.
Although the Parliamentary Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure sanitary certificate”, it now recognized the need to work on £1 billion in the reconstruction of Parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre near, rather than on the Westminster green benches.
Goddard noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with the various rules”.
It is not possible to know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who failed to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that has successfully filed asbestos-related claims," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
Suddenly, I started to feel sick.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleurisy, the shells around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract the liquid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
His health had gradually improved and he had returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was involved in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The link was clear in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his consultant showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was introduced between the lining of his chest and the shell of his lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnosed
Suddenly, Abbott fell into contact with Macmillan’s nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“Asbestos appears to have been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation was quite common on pipes,” he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now striking younger people with an unusual profession.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many of the officers who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to a toxic substance.
For decades after the war, hospitals proved to be a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the patients, but a place that posed a threat to life for the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed Bunzen's burners on asbestos pads
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing isolational and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many have probably been exposed to asbestos for the first time in their class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos pads.
Websites have been developed to highlight the asbestos problem in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as an empty tile or a roof of Sarai usually contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden locusts.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realize that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and figure it out.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from being a doctor to being a patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how confused he was with the amount of information he had to accept.
"It was hard to understand everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life, the act of breathing itself, that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be trapped in the weeds, the shell of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleur and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos needle fibers”, Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
It was that hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who may have been affected by an internship at the hospital.
Asbestos needles fall into the fabric of the lungs, says Treger, “breath pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is caused by heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a try.
The treasurer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the weed," he says.
There's no way she'd come around with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is “not well controlled by chemotherapy” which “acts” but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live a long time," said Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis was made, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with the mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an office of support and advice for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he eloquently said when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months to extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "hastened to give everyone a slightly more positive paint."
Having met several experts, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunski, professor of thoracic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a route, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role in patients with mesothelioma in order to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is inevitably ineffective, many sufferers face yet another financial cause for concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very few could put health at risk.
That's when they talked about the badness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full cost settlement, according to Morgan, because Lawson couldn't clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After the investigation into his death, the representative of the hospital of Gaia confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements referred to was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, the death toll on one company or workplace, usually decades later, has been a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers switched owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that there is no time on their side that the plaintiffs may not have.
In response, serious new legislation was issued this year, which facilitates a patient with a mesothelioma process of obtaining compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund financed by the insurance industry has been established for those who have been diagnosed since July 2012 and who can prove contact but who cannot be tried.
In such cases, the patient will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
“This is a transaction written by insurers for insurers”, he said, implying that the sum was a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the interim period had not intervened and that the patients with the mesothelioma would have been able to track the companies and file a claim on a regular basis.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “imperfect”.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven people dying each day, rapid action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of the Bill of Mesothelioma in December last year.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange Lazdunski recommended a surgical intervention that, unlike Tom Trezdun, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a therapy in which Lange Lazdunski could boast 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt the tide.
"It is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some kind of power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I should have just turned 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things -- finance when I die, for example, or what it takes to show my wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news, you become disgruntled.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted in a very different way.
The Thames are very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer has to face.
But for those with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries a dark certainty (even eventually for Stephen Jay Gould).
According to Andrew Morgan, "mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissue.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the cartridges and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now there's a painting that's not on fire.
I've seen the napkins made out of him, stained in the fireplaces at the banquets.
The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (even bank notes) and tissues.
Large asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect heat insulator for the steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
The global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential show premature mortality among asbestos workers who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke shows that the particles of asbestos in her lungs "were, without a doubt, the main cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, don't take responsibility.
No compensation shall be paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding is developing intensively, one of the most deadlyly dangerous professions in contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on blue asbestos imports
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
Asbestos has grown to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in Britain.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protestors swear to avenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow the Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists have begun planning and mobilizing in the hours following that statement.
The decision of the All-Thai People ' s Assembly, in fact, allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it does lead to rage," said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with authoritarian regimes.
In protecting China's decision, Lee Fay, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, said that allowing the popular election of Hong Kong's leader would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to elect a head of government by voting since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives the Hong Kong the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Beijing-controlled nominee commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and wide-ranging protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
A large part of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which was threatened by the organizers of which to close the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing does not guarantee true universal electoral law.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise at the wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of taking the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
It is with great regret that, to date, all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
The Hong Kong State authorities had been preparing for Beijing ' s statement for several days, and security measures involving the police and the barricade had been strengthened at the Government headquarters on Sunday.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of inhabitants from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also increased fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement by saying that its demonstrations put business at risk, the source of Hong Kong’s life force.
“The protest they are talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long," said Regina Ip, the legislator who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to worry about Hong Kong getting out of control.
It's a notion that's harmful to investment.
China ' s public media also reported on recent days in which Hong Kong democratic activists were shown by Western Powers ' diversions.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came out of one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshmen are invited to come on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first luxury travel service in Britain for current students.
To leave a bright impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers modes of transport such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to drive their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In combination with our new options for VIP, we look forward to helping students get to the university this year with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A representative of the company reported that since the service had just been launched, orders had not yet been received, but added that “students would start ordering the service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9,000 a year for training, it still hoped to find a market for this service.
The current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever to make an excellent first impression, and VIP is exactly what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union has criticized this service as being devoid of reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of NSS Higher Education, said: "This project seems incredibly remote from the lives of most students.
Many students who will begin university studies this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly increasing cost of basic needs before they can even begin to think about raising thousands of pounds on something like a simple arrival at a dorm.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police conduct after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who came raised their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the murder of an unarmed teenager named Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West grew and nationalized, Perez saw responses from white women who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as “Thinkings of Ferguson from the face of a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant change.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about the white colour of the skin and the privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we've faced, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so linked to race, they felt that they needed to point out it.
For an English professor at Ohio Corita University, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “female problems” in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write about how colorful people are being attacked in their own country, silence deafens.
"Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly divide those problems; they faced complex realities every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“ Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the rape of a white woman was almost always the cause of it,” said Hatteri.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From the point of view of Hatteri, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," said Heather.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why colorful women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the South Women ' s Association for lynching prevention.
The group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson -- police behaviour, racial discrimination -- reflects the time when white feminists had to “bring” the problems faced by black women in several generations.
"Really, it would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology were equally serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what this means.
A prominent white activist of the feminist movement, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by columnist Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans participate more in protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger in the body - and the views of racial problems that differ significantly in public surveys - will be at the forefront of change," Stein wrote.
Although Steinem advocates a more intertwined feminism that includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
American Business Institute researcher Christine Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, “are much more vulnerable than their sisters”, but the Steinem trailers about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small programme, the Watchtower to my brother, to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, was followed by an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem promoting the leading line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-western border this year, immigration reform has once again surfaced - this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that all she needed to do was share the stories of immigrant women in order to address the issue as important to women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them are placed in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are being responded to by women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's house "with pigs" is sold
The photo of the house displayed for sale in Saffolka was removed by real estate agents when it found that it contained a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120,000, a single one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a photograph of a guest house, depicting a pig with a head resting on a couch.
The Real Estate Agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo was a pet of the owner of the house.
“However, the photograph was placed by mistake and has already been removed”, said a representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of assembly as a "unique single house with one bedroom".
Although the Agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still in advertising material.
The sale of the house has aroused interest in social networks, where some have asked whether the pig is sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open, gave up Caroline Woznacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year and try to get to a new level, transferring Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How will you generally rate your results in the Big helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Rollan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarter final.
What tasks do you have until the end of the season?
After an injury, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a few weeks.
A member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth, former World Champion Nikolai Valuev, proposed that GTO should pay bonuses when entering colleges.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times, and that people would give up standards for lifting, running and other exercises.
It will be recalled that 12 Russian actors will begin to implement the TCO norm on their territory from 1 September.
I also invited schoolchildren who had given up GTOs, to give bonuses when they entered colleges, said Valuev.
For example, they could add a little points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional exit workers to enterprises that have undergone sport tests.
There's a new millionaire in the city of Harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery.
The player in the Harvey lottery this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire south-west of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery game Saturday night.
Harvey's newsstand is bringing gold in the game of the top prize for the second time in five years, and the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be declared.
The owner of Steve Forward's bench said that the win called for a ride in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everybody's very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the top prize last month, noting the completion of a few happy weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Valley players became one of the five million in August, following a huge $7.5 million win by a Belmont couple just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and reported that the winning gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A Harvey millionaire brings the number of prize winners in West Australia to 59 this year, with a total win of $85 million.
Mine-economy wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
During this week, Mineconomy will introduce a comprehensive plan for clean transport in Russia to the Government, as told by the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Oleg Pląznikov on the round table, which was held at the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan is commissioned by the Government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, says Plujniki, the proposed measures relating to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy has the News) is for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and decisions should be made on how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
A report to the Government describing the tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessional lending and leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, amendments to legal acts are envisaged to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking spaces, filling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals to the regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of giving it an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand the purchase of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, Mine-economic development will have added criteria to the list of indicators for the evaluation of regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of support for clean transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The electricity market in Russia is still emerging, with about 100 electric cars being sold throughout the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, import duties on electric vehicles were cancelled, and sales amounted to about 500, predicts the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
But five times the growth does not make electric cars any more visible: 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia in 2013, according to the European Business Association.
So far only Mitsubishi Motors import electric cars into Russia.
Imports are being prepared for Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Renault Strategic Planning and Partnerships Director in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most of the other electric transport producers, however, took a waiting position on Russia.
The development of electric cars is also the case with Russian producers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is miserable.
For example, in January-July 2014, ASM-Holding released 30 electric cars.
The demand for low prices due to the cost of electric cars is acknowledged by the Director of AutoVAZ for Engineering Sergey Amanov, without the support of the breakout in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market in addition to the road (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as the internal combustion engine) inhibits the indevelopment of the charging infrastructure (fuels - units), sighs Sergey Zelikov, director of the Autostata.
Due to the expensive and low rate of reduction in the cost of the electric car in the next 3-4 years, it will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, projected by the editor-in-chief, Mikhail Podorožanski, Celikov agrees.
On the contrary, car manufacturers say that some electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional cars.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, and the main thing is to give consumers confidence that “electricity” is real; this will, inter alia, contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rosetti: several stations are being built in Moscow, and about 80 more will be available soon.
Negotiations on the construction of a fuel network are also under way with other regions.
According to the director of the Rosetti Department, Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a uniform standard for charging different brands.
In addition, Rosetti, as a network company, is not entitled to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric cars is being explored.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of maintaining the Russian electricity market for customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it and extending the concessional list is being worked out.
The replacement of a transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as sensitive as Customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric cars, now accounting for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for motorists, such as free parking in the city centre (as they have already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars along the designated lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private plane crashed into Colorado
Piper PA-46 crashed into the American state of Colorado.
Three out of the five people in it have died, and itar-TASS has been transferred.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred within miles of the Denver airport runway.
The reasons for the tragedy are now established.
In the Donetsk region, they're dealing with the captured fighters of the Donbass battalion.
They've surrounded the carers under Ilovaysk.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of forcemen died under fire.
Those who survived said that if they knew what the situation was in the south-east of Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The Donbass battalion's drivers survived the meatballs they got under Ilovaysky.
In the vicinity of the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days in fact abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that a ring could be taken out of the alleged corridor, the column moved.
But in just a few minutes, shells and bullets whistled from all sides.
"According to the information given to me, we had permission to leave the corridor," says the vice commander of the battalion, who had a summons for the Lermonts.
And when we came down between Multipol and Rednosel, we started a cross-fire with anti-tank-controlled missiles, with “tushes”, 30-millimeter grenades, automatic BMD rifles, small arms.
I had four cars in front of me and three in the back, and then there were only two cars left.
An officer with a summons for the Lemonts says that almost immediately, at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by those who have come to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that so-called “terrorists” treat them well, provide food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
Colonna, the whole battalion to be destroyed.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his companions, Alexei volunteered, as Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by separatists.
Alexei has already seen a completely different picture here.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me there was a mortar shot going on, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about the departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilowaysk by the congregation with Zurahovo.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 were trapped in the boiler below Ilovaysk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would not enter the prison battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to the forces of the DNR.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
The region has established a headquarters to limit prices for products
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyar region, which will, if necessary, limit the increase in prices for products in the region ' s market.
A decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the Government of the Province, representatives of the Executive and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the region.
News The Economy Will Kiev Reimburse Rosnefti $140 million in losses?
Igor Sechin, head of Rosnefti, said that the company estimated the damage caused by the shooting of the Lisichan NPP in Ukraine at $140 million.
That's what he reported in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation”, said Secin.
According to him, the introduction into operation of the modernized company Lisicanski NPP was planned in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no "diggers", but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technology oil that was attached to the pipes has disappeared," he said.
Recall, on 18 July, in connection with the shooting of the Lisichan NPZ, the oil storage tank was burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisicjanski NPZ is the main refinery in Ukraine, first of all established in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisican NHRI is about 7 million tonnes of oil raw material per year.
The plant is capable of releasing Euro-4 fuel, as well as Euro-5 dispersal batches.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichan PNZ were suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichan NPP along with other Ukrainian TNC-WR assets.
The DPRK launched a small-range missile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time by Chagando province, located on the North Korean and Chinese border.
As reported by Interfax on the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the rocket reportedly fell into the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
Ruble falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew to 37.15 rubles at the opening, and the ruble fell to a bivalent basket against the background of geopolitical tension.

Continued to cheapen and ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now playing out the deterioration of the geopolitical environment and possible new sanctions against Russia in advance.
So far, however, this is more like an artificial hysteria spread through the media, especially Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions into the RF are not too many.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the bivalent basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative soon, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be tried by Ideal Tour
"Orenburg Airlines" has filed "ideal tour" claims totalling 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases to be held in October.
There will be different judges to deal with cases.
According to Interfax, the first action was filed on 14 August.
Its sum is just over 425 million rubles.
The meeting on it was scheduled for 7 October.
The second statement was made on 18 August.
His sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting on it was scheduled for 2 October.
As reported to journalists in the Russian Union, different judges have been appointed.

Director-General of the airline, Victor Zükin, speaks of a sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
The director-general of Aeroflota Vitaly Saveliev calls it another two billion roubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service has changed the user registration process so that new participants can be more involved in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
The new Twitter users will now watch a large number of accounts recommended by the account service during the registration process to complete their reading cycle immediately.
The recommendations shall be based on the interests recorded in the register.
In doing so, Twitter automatically installs a subscriber for all automatically selected accounts.
As a result, the user will have to remove the twigs manually so as not to read those he does not care about.
If previously microblogging users have only seen the avatars of recommended users, Twitter is now extracting a sample of one of the popular blogger's tweets to help make an impression on a person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve an unforgettable outcome.
In 2014, the microblogging service encountered a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company is currently in desperate need of more loyal consumer resources, which would last once.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
A Day of Knowledge in Moscow Will Be Wicked and Rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovje from 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather clears, it will rain, and the wind of the east quarter will be quite weak - just 3-8 meters per second.
The vehicle disposal programme has resumed since 1 September
Since 1 September, a vehicle disposal programme has been resumed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for this purpose.
According to RF head Dennis Mantourov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistributing it from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will be between 40,000 per light car and 350,000 rubles per truck.
Earlier in Russia, such a vehicle disposal programme had already been in place.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now envisaged not only to dispose of vehicles for subsequent discounts, but also the possibility that if the vehicle reaches the age of more than six years, it would be possible to acquire a new one with a discount when the old one is transferred to the dealer's trade-in.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal disposal programme, which was in operation from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the car production rate in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release the game about modern journalism
The game designer Nikki Case, known as Coming Out Simulator, decided to play a game on modern journalism.
He talked about his project in the Kill Screen interview.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is only now widely known.
Events in Ferguson are the source of inspiration for the game, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how history coverage affects its effects.
A hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what is happening in areas where there is a conflict between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect what's going on.
If he shoots the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protestors become bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where he can't go.
If he shed light on events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be picked up using a Twitter character that will have new subscribers if the photos shown there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image demonstrating how the event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but at first he wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States but to developments in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to shed light on the history of the region.
However, when he saw media coverage of events in Ferguson, he decided to play for the reasons of the incident.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who issues browser games.
His most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which describes events in Case's own biography, focuses on how a bisexual adolescent tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Helette is bringing Ukraine into the bloodbath
The call to prepare for the next “ten thousand” victims by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Heletei, has drawn the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, according to a report by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military agency, Valérie Heletya, who declared “the completion of the operation to liberate Ukraine from terrorists” and began the “Great Domestic War”, in which the losses would be “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military agency, which published the above-mentioned post on its Facebook page, is an object for research in non-military expertise," the Russian diplomats reported.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “By informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he stated that “the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized
Today, more than 60 stars of Hollywood have captured the horror.
The hackers hacked into iCloud's primitive passwords in smartphones, then their intimate images appeared on the blog site of Perez Hilton.
Really, for a while.
Recall, the official representative of the Star of the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone and has confirmed that all the images that are "shining" on the Web are real.
Pérez Hilton, the creator of the one-name tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues at the company for publishing their frank recordings, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the revealed images of the stars have already been spread over the Web.
David Beckham was in a car accident, hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham got into a motorcycle accident, saving himself from a paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles on the turn of the Boulevard Sunset.
The British football player was separated by a hiccup and a stretch of the right hand muscles.
Beckham came out of a tattoo parlor where the paparazzi were waiting for him.

As a result, Beckham was injured, his right arm and a scratch were stretched.
Tony Stewart suffers from an accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall the second time after his right front tire broke into 172 circles, ending his speech.
Stuart brought his car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now they're focusing on the next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the Sunday night race, after a collision with Kyle Bush, requiring repairs on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope of reaching the finish," said Johnston, adding, "it just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was loaded onto an evac, and the team assembled and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during a ground race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took the route to express his dissatisfaction with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
The decision on whether Stuart would be charged was not made.
The three-time champion was met with loud voices and applause when he was introduced to the race.
Starting with the 12th position, Stuart went to the first 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then 122 laps after the restart of Bush's number.
Car 18 came off the trajectory on the way out of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart's moved on, but he's down to the 21st position.
Sobcak and Witorgan eat cigarettes with Zwanicki in Odessa
Xenia Sobczak and Maxim Witorgan are now in Odessa, which the television host has not missed in her Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising, and it was very distressing to the fans of the couple.
It's taken by Zwenicki.
"Michael Mikhalych Zwanecki Maksim at breakfast explains what Instagram is:) #Odessa" - signed a photo of Xenia Sobczak.
However, there is nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, no beans, no butter, anything else.
The couples decided that Ksushah was also smoking, and they condemned her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?," "Smoking kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast"), "It's like having breakfast and only cigarettes on the table))))) "Xenia, you smoke too?", excited about their favorite subscribers of her blog.
Remember, Sobczak recently boasted of what a delicious meal Maxim Witorgan had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the house, and your husband prepares dinner for your arrival, for the first time in a married life, because it's delicious.The main thing is that at the end of dinner he doesn't say the words of the anecdote, "that every day should be," she boasted of her husband, Xenia Sobczak.
The video shows that Maxim is cooking something with zeal and salt and baked chicken are already served on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria staged a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return the former working conditions that had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new schedule of work, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement has been reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the BNR head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of Punishment, Rosen Železkov, reported.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior will join the protests of the Prison Workers' Union.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Pravita Wongsuwana (left) as Minister of Defence
General Praut Chan-Ocha, Military Governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers of the country in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or generals on resignation.
The representatives of the army received key posts: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was formally approved as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military Government to the post.
A 60-year-old military officer who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Minister's post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed MPs.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by a six-year demonstration during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawatt.
Officially, Praut Chan-Ocha will be the provisional Prime Minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that military forces are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the background of total paralysis of civilian authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were placed under temporary arrest.
As soon as the military came to power, they arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taksin as Prime Minister.
They are both popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has often been successful in the elections.
However, many middle-class and capital elites have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one ever said the media salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, a waitress from Palm's new bra.
It has to be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain inviolable.
Everybody knows for a long time that we say "Belgium" -- we mean the media, we say "media" -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to say that the success of the facility depends on three factors: location, location and location again.
There are places not that good, but even great, but some unfortunate ones.
Shortly after sitting at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a coffee town here (in honor of the same TV show), then an Odessa mom, and then a restaurant called Bojole and a beer friend.
Now here's another beer, but not nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a barstand and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space without even a hint of sunlight.
It is fun, though, as it is in the children’s room: red, yellow, and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of TV windows, where girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg are long overdue, so there is something to compare them with.
There are eight types of spill beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress makes a happy presentation of the menu, saying that "midias are greasy large seeds", and it should be noted that the service, despite some misreadings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by content, but often very unexpected.
Who, for example, is to be warned that a meat roll with Vallonian blacks (280 rubles) - actually a carpaccio cut so thinly that a parchment paper in comparison to it will appear to be inconspicuously thick.
There's only one way to taste it if you're going to get half-past together.
Salad's even worse.
The classic Lezian (260) would most likely be a crime against the Belgian people: some ghastly iceberg, once opened by a long time ago, a sour Kenyan beans, old-fashioned bacon chips, plus some marinated onions.
You won't want to meet anyone with a bed salad like that!
The composition of the Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If it was still possible to close your eyes on immature tomato quarters or overheated shampoos, why do the media seem to have been able to thaw and open them several times in their lifetime!
I already know that there are quite normal white sea media here!
They are served in “in a sauce of your choice” (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen soybeans, the white wine, the seldere and the carrots, they're not honest.
There are fruits, and there is no smell of wine, and there is no mystery.
However, good frittata with homemade mayonnaise on the media.
Chicken fire here is not bread, thick to the point that depending on your mood you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a pleasant saucer.
It was said that the rabbit cooked locally in a beer sauce and there was no mention of rosemary.
The situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: Rosemary was stifling everything.
It appeared that the rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes in its life, from which the meat had acquired such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit’s leg was fitted with a wonderful — no, just a cancelling pear in a caramelized crust.
Palm waffles offer not only sweets but also small ones with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce proved to be an excess of water, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who approached the table was very informally interested in lunchtime impressions.
So it's worth it again.
The dollar rate rose at the IMF above 37 roubles on news of the new sanctions against Russia on the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar at 10:29 a.m. was raised by 26.9 kips, which was 37.02 rubles, and the euro was raised by 30 kopecks, up to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The bivalent basket grew by 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 rubles on 19 February 2009, and on 3 March 2014, it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark, says Senior Ana Bodrov analyst Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will eventually be reflected in courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumours of military invasion have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week is projected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links to one chain.
Inflation is also projected: current prices for autumn will be added from 5 to 10 per cent.
Seasonal vegetables and fruit will soon be finished and a vacuum will come as long as the networks are redirected to other suppliers.
"A dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there was no strong hysteria," said the head of the Market Analysis Division, "Discovery of Broker" Constantine Bushuev.
They will continue to see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday as NATO meets.
Rubble, he said, was severely weakened after the end of the tax season, then sent news to Ukraine, and last week CB said that by the end of the year, it was moving completely to a floating course and was refusing any monetary intervention.
If you look at the day-wave, it was nothing different from the previous month, and everyone was frightened by the mark in 37 rubles, and the analyst continues.
And so, nothing powerful has happened in terms of traffic.
The alarming times for the currency market were, as a reminder, when an increased demand for currency was observed at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the CB shipped a record number of currencies.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the ruble weakening.
First of all, this is the increase in the income of the export budget, as well as the competitiveness of domestic producers through the increase in imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be a negative factor.
The sharp fluctuations in Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, lead to an increase in inflationary pressure and, consequently, lead to an increase in the borrowing of money, which in turn hampers the development of the country ' s economy.
When it comes to the stock market, the undercutting of the ruble slightly smoothes down the price of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the IMF's sales index dropped by 1.67 per cent during Thursday and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
Such a significant difference in the relative decrease in indices is due to a decrease of more than 1.5 per cent in ruble during the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy the currency.
As practice has shown, emotions have gradually deteriorated and the quotations of rubles have partially or completely restored lost positions.
“We believe that we will soon be able to see the dollar/Russian currency ratio of 36 rubles per dollar,” notes Alexie Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
Britain reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Marie-Tuta (SCHMT) disease, a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The charitable organization CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are believed to have CMMs, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady walking, and burnt toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's (AF) attack, a condition for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what others did.
I've been falling every day, and I've had more time to do it.
I've never been able to skate or skate with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because of how I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical map when her doctor came out of the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and had the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had thought, and she had asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found with a C.M.T.
"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I had pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The British Charity Organization announced a month of information on the CMM to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on Washington area entrepreneurs is increasing as the economy recovers
The emerging economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax bills for companies across the country have increased moderately last year, when the economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the Washington Zone company is no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local executions in financial 2013 by 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
Tax burdens on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes grew faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent according to a study carried out by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenues are on firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the least tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the value of company real estate, researchers say, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these revenues are in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, the same seems to be true in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in real estate taxes by the state and local levels last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - 4.2 per cent more than in the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate did not have a similar effect on state and local tax revenues, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
“What is happening in Maryland is that most of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has much more to rely on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also appears to be in the process of being amended, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared corporate state income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax, mostly in the region.
While trends are moving in one direction, the corporate tax burden at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as that of the country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes are lower for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for corporate taxes than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to achieve tax revenues targets next year, the law could lead to income tax for entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local levels, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure whereby most small firms - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with much higher growth rates than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and the increase in income from business taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with taxes on turnover in state and local governments increased by 6.2 per cent during the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world championship for judo won two silver and seven bronze prizes to the assembly of Russia.
Under this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competitions, the assembly of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day the Russian team received a silver medal.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, who served in the category of up to 60 kg.
In an equal final fight against Balbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition resolved only one comment received by the Russian.
On the second day of the tournament, three medals were won for the assembly of Russia.
In men's competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was obtained by Mikhail Pullayev and bronze by Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian gave up the 2011 and 2013 World Cup to the Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who lost his compatriot at the quarter-final stage, won the comforting tournament and won the bronze prize.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg, Natala Kuzutina also reached the third stage of the pedestal.
In the semifinals, she lost the current World Champion Mailinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzyutin won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had defeated Kuzutina before in the finals of the European Championship, was a barrier to Russian gold.
On the third day of the Chelyabinsk Bronze tournament, Musa Moshkov, who fought in the category of up to 73 kg, put Musa Moshkov in the Russian coven.
In the quarterfinals, he became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skovortsov, now in favour of the OAU team.
But then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the prize.
Mojskov performed at a home championship with a naked-foot injury that he plans to treat in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for ex-Moldovin Skvortsov, he and he made it to the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who accepted OAU sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko completed his speech with bronze up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day of CM-2014, he also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontov won in the category of up to 81 kg.
In a heavy battle against the small finale, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmidt by commenting on the rival.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally restricted themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill of Questions, and Russia’s complicity was guaranteed: its rival was Kirill Denisov, a compatriot.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival of Questionov was unable to get out on the tats because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was won by the masters and on the sixth day of the competition, Renat Saidov placed it in the coven, in a category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moore.
That was the end of the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Sunday, world championships were played in the team competitions.
Both Russian recruits - male and female - were among the main winners of the prizes, but, as in individual competitions, the women of the fine sex were not happy - they did not get to the medal.
And here were Russian judoists who won the command silver.
In decisive opposition, they have given up the main competitors of the competition, the Japanese team, in a persistent struggle against the account 2-3.
At the same time, Russia's conscription led 2-0 after Han-Magomed's pure victory and the willful Denis Jarcev (heighing up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magogmedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
The same scenario was followed by a bronze match in a women's tournament, where a 2-0 Russian conscription team gave way to the Japanese 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who congratulated the men's silver band after the tournament.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was visible that you could have become champions," said Putin, quoted by the RIA News.
To lose to the Japanese, to the judo's parents, there's nothing to see.
But I'm sure you can win.
The Russian Assembly at the world's home championship was doing much better than it was a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
There were only three medals in the assets of the Russian team - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, great perfectionists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle joins the eight strongest, he's the potential winner of the Olympics.
Even more so in the form of sport such as judo," the RF Minister of Sport Vitali Mutko summed up the results of the tournament, which is quoted by the champion's press service.
Japan’s congregation was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which proved to be gold.
The next world championship will take place next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news, and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers’ Family Hopes for the Best
Joan Rivers is unconscious from her arrival at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian actress would be cured of the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai on Thursday after an emergency call saying that she had had a heart stop at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, reported by sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under drug control and under close surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including numerous support on the Internet from such ones as Donald Trump, Montell Williams and Kelly Rip.
All will be able to be kings
In sales, the debut album by the Royal Blood group is a new British year's hope for a rock-duets straight from the clubs to the stadiums.
Duet Royal Blood has been on stage for a year, but he already has an asset nomination for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour at Arctic Monkeys and a New York concert tour from Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 pre-requisitions a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in the Major-Layer Music portfolio.
In view of the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation from a number of backgrounds is not about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet-voting representative of the new R'n'B, but about a duet of bullish-looking British playing with the level of loudness and intensity that was last fashioned a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album was particularly high in all the above-mentioned circumstances and has already been fully justified.
Duet did not take for granted a name that they had previously been able to reach unless it was the desperate, hairy metalists, and the blood of which the kings seemed to be flowing in their veins, too, understood.
This is, of course, primarily the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to instill the British year's stagnant blood, bringing it to a new height.
Prognosis about the success of this business is likely to be early, but something can be argued.
A dozen songs in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer's gift as a sure and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the values of individual numbers cannot be denied: for example, the Out Of The Black pilot single is characterized by what is remembered not by a melodious line, but by a drum.
Musicians joke that this song is easier to get into than to get tense.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful Little Monster and closing the record of the "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy - rock party, but when they are lost in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The Royal Blood force is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (most likely the Motörhead successors), but have taken many rock duvets out of the ghetto Indian clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is designed for the stadiums in a room of less than a few thousand people.
A secret in the subtle use of a bass that replaced a guitar in the usual format, which was in the beginning of the zeros of The White Stripes.
After all, it's not just about the instruments, it's about the way it works.
Zero-zero heroes were hard to choose from beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not only as epigons but as self-creating creative units.
The Royal Blood is now sounding so strong and so sudden that this effort successfully scratches some secondaryity and firmness of musical material.
After all, who said the rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online magazine - and video producer, and another hundred other things - buys a Twitch stream video production service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch's sale of Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination looked natural.
Twitch, based only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general stream service, a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their inside points; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And let's play, a genre of videocasters, in which people know that they give (mainly, old ones) processing, like in the Mysterious Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twitch, so news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been met without any particular interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company that buys potential competitors.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the CEO of Twitch Emmet Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is Twitch's incredible success.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than at watching it, find it difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking a joystick into their own hands.
It's one thing to look at each other's shoulders at 3 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of vision alone can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passes in which the Rogers Bennisters of our electronic age complete the entire game in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about playing virtuoso or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is going to come down to Amazon Instant Video just as neatly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "They both believe in the future games," and this channel does not give any indication of scolding, even -- oh -- as a visual sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages -- almost all of them now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the cemetery observer, the City of Angels, Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Mother of Beslan, Susan Doudieva, who participated in the specialization of the MCS staff -- as reported by the social correspondent Elizabeth Antonov, a special project correspondent.
Having returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who served 10 years ago as adviser to the President of the North Caucasus and held talks with terrorists, as well as with the management officer of the FSB of Russia, Viacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on the subject was that in Beslan it was as if I had not been in Beslan for ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, and people find it difficult to agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very severe.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job," Antonov said.
The special project has been prepared by the Rambler & Co Infographics Studio, which has been working for companies since the spring of this year.
The previous special projects were dedicated to World War I and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's presence in power.
DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small-range missile into the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time by Chagando Province, located on the North Korean and Chinese border.
The rocket had reportedly fallen into the Japanese Sea, some 220 kilometres had passed, and had been announced on the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Members suggested that the Personal Data Act should be expedited
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
The State introduces a draft law to postpone the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative framework of the lower chamber.
It was sponsored by the deputies of Gosduma Vadim Dengin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Justice Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
This change, according to the sponsors of the initiative, will contribute to a faster and more effective protection of the rights of RF citizens to personal data protection and to the confidentiality of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which has been speeded by parliamentarians, requires that Russian personal data processed via the Internet be stored in the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, refine and extract personal data of RF citizens in databases located in Russia and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law empowers Roscomnadzor to restrict access to information processed in violation of the law of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data on the basis of a court decision.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “blacklists” of violator sites, the automated information system “Registration of violators of personal data”.
This law was passed in the summer.
The drafters were Andrey Lugovo and Vadim Dengin of the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of the CRC.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also co-sponsors of the current draft law on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who do not have data centres in the RF will have to pay rent
Commenting on the draft law introduced in Gosduma today, the first chapter of the Men's Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he did not see any problems with the transposition of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that will not have their own personal data storage facilities in the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015 will be able to rent them, for example, to “Rostelecom” who has repeatedly said that they are willing to rent their servers and are already providing their servers to the Mail Group, Western companies that are already providing their servers”.
“There are also several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this area”, he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in RF territory, I see no problems - they will be granted technological accommodation”, Levin summed up.
Controversial Bill
As soon as the draft law was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications feared that if the bill was adopted, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, the provision of online airfare and hotel security services.
According to the association, “the bill deprives the data subjects of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by determining by themselves that their recording, systematization, etc. must be provided only in databases located in the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be to establish a user-awareness mechanism on where the record was being recorded, to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, he would be able to choose the territory in which the actions would be carried out.
The adoption of such draft laws on “localization” of personal data in other countries has resulted in the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
An ice-water test participant pulled out her jaw
Isabelle Roberts of Britain screamed so much when icy water was poured on her head that it damaged the facial bone structure.
This test of the icy water has gone wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the ice water test that she pulled her jaw out.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so fiercely when icy water was poured on her head that it damaged the facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw began to crack," she said.
They're pouring water on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't close, and he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to understand the same thing, and they started hunting, but I had to get to the emergency room immediately.
A 20-year-old woman from Britain was taken to a hospital to practice her jaws after participating in a popular engagement on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the Army of Novorossia, they claim to have defeated Ukrainian Su-27 and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded and the bodies of 35 soldiers killed.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the New Russia Army press service.
He added that “the Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire had been struck down by PPE forces in the area of the Mereshki settlement”.
According to the Agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when shelling the Lugani airport.
The representative of the press noted that the two helicopters of the Ukrainian military at one of the field airfields had been damaged by the militia overnight, as well as the destruction of two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
“The lives of the enemy - up to one hundred people killed and wounded - have been captured by 13 people”, the staff representative summed up.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, Donbass's armed forces announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war to the Ukrainian side and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, at night, the DNR army, according to the New Russia Army, “cut off the attempt by the Nacguards in violation of previous arrangements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area”.
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMWs in short-term combat, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during the night were five tanks, eight armoured vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilovaysk area in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so subject to the surrender of weapons and ammunition to the opponent.
The first dozen troops began leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass, Semen Semenchenko, 14 more people left the cauldron on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity to 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the RF and 9 of the RF Tank Brigade”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation have denied reports from the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
RUF: Russia will respond if EU sanctions are imposed
Russia reserves the right to respond to its legitimate interests if new anti-Russian sanctions are imposed, reports the RUF.
A report by the Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority stated that the “conclusions” of the European Council of 30 August had demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their inconsiderate support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country”, says the agency's website.
The RUF regrets that, contrary to the interests of its member States, Eurosovovet is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as conditions for a full “dealing between the parties to the conflict”, the agency stresses.
The Department also notes that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
It will be recalled that specific proposals on sanctions against RF are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
It is expected that they will correlate with each other the measures imposed on the period of action and the degree of severity.
The new sanctions of the European Union could affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Smart ways to save money in university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books to seniors, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My math analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a $10 semester and a Chuck-fil-A," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
The book’s rental is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and it is often cheaper than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, owned by more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book advertising has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops were rented during last spring, says Vice-President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here's an introductory course in the best way to make a profitable deal.
Buying in Internet Store
Sometimes if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is worth about $290 per preview, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of maintenance
If you don't mind someone else's markings or injuries, the textbooks you've kept are a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassededay, 25, a fourth-graduate student from Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a supported copy of The Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding the business side of advertising.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracy, director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, suggest that students clarify to their professors whether previous publications should not be used.
At times, updates are not essential to the exercise.
In such cases, old editions are often found for a very small percentage of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying maintained books.
Prokate
If you treat them well enough, don’t forget to return them, and don’t want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematic Analysis" for about $20 a semester.
Find out the rules of the store where you take your books, including any fines that may be imposed on you for markings, underlinings and damage.
If you take the book for rent, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually purchased by obtaining an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" tour on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracy says that students who study literature can often find the most profitable prices, since many classical works can now be jumped for free, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Holt, 29, who is about to start school at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as this guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before making an online order, says Holt, make sure the book is actually in storage.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he acquired was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the development fund of the Far East was ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared at a meeting on the management of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the long-term development budget investment fund, created two years ago, was ineffective, reported by the Interfax.
“15 billion rubles remain on deposits,” the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State tasked with accelerating the adoption of the list of pre-eminent development territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be introduced into Gosduma in the autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted by the President, had never approved the list of territories of pre-emergency development in the Far East and their criteria before 1 July.
Vladimir Putin also outlined the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, the region ' s transport accessibility, the removal of infrastructure constraints, both in the internal market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create the prerequisites for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as for the establishment of pre-development territories that should become competitive with key ATR business centres, the President emphasized.
It was recalled that it had previously been reported that the pre-development territory could replace the EEZ.
Why the Galactic Guards couldn't save the cash charges
Sylvester Stallon has returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, while the City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing for only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's Home Video brought only $14.6 million on the first weekends, while children's films such as "How to Use Dragon 2" are also disappointing.
A film critic named Telegraph Robbie Colin points out that when it comes to children’s films, it may be in poor film quality.
Colleen called 2014 the "worse" year in history with regard to children's films, and called "How to employ dragon 2 barely "functioning" with the continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at the audience of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average rating of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film that took place in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both filmmakers and movie critics, suggest that the production of films this year is similar to that of last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the situation may be in changing visual habits and the increasing popularity of stream Internet services, such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-travelled Disney Book of the Jungle movie, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current decline in cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix’s income from the stream reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the studios for relying too much on comic books franchises, and predicted Hollywood's crash.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions had a share of the truth.
Since several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Avengers: Ery Altrona, Minyonov and Jurassic Park, other representatives of the cinema industry are more optimistic.
Human X producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in cash charges just "cyclical," said Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not frighten the owners of Caucasian and Central Asian food establishments, but Russian suppliers are a terrible dream for European and Japanese cuisine restaurants.
In general, general demand has so far preferred to replace prohibited imports not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"Better is a little pickle than a bad mozzarella," says the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheese offered by the Italian suppliers.
Mozzarella and the cheese burrat ended up in the restaurant first, having a small storage period.
Parmesan stocks should be enough for a few more months.
What do you want to do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat was on the carts only 30 centimeters [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
That's when I said we'd never buy anything for our restaurant in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things changed there now.
But the other day, I was brought fish from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be dead!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought this to us.
Valério is surprised to learn that many of Italy’s normal items are for a Russian gamemaker.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to depend on it to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said, "So it's yours, Russian!"
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
In five minutes' walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" there is a stop list in the kitchen showing the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chef of the Brasserie Bridge and the Arrow Bar, Direct Trygel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheese, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
After all, the director becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The flower cabbage is 200 rubles!
I said, "Why is it so much?"
They say, "Well, we've got to make some money too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost 80 rubles!
Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, do you have any idea how long their vest weighs?
At a price, it's super-delicate.
Russian suppliers appear to be one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many European cuisine restaurants do not know what will happen to them when the cheese supply runs out.

Sanctions menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly referred to as product sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and sub-products from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, mollusks, milk, yogurt, artificial cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups into the country.
Restaurants have started a charade with suppliers: food prices have risen, and there is an urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have a major impact on expensive restaurants in France, Italy, Spain, in which products were delivered directly from the “mother” countries.
The generals have had to change before.
For example, when in early 2014, Rosselhosadzor banned the importation of Australian beef and the year before, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers made deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer-2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for crops.
Italian Valério hopes that the sanctions may yet be commuted.
While some restaurants exist in uncertainty.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change menus under local farmers and other countries," says Sergey Mironov, the restaurant owner of Restconsult.
If the chef's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We're the only ones with very few cooks, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brasserie Bridge is ready to do this: to give up 10-15% of the meal, half of the menu is to be processed.
In mixed kitchen restaurants, meals are already being replaced, such as steaks made of marble beef for beefstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” says Oxana Glibchuk, a representative of East West.
Plums and milk products from Europe have similar characteristics in Russia and Belarus.
Chickens from the United States can be replaced by chickens from Russia and Belarus, salmon and symphony from Norway, salmon, semga, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of vegetables and fruit from European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget for the online restaurants would be simpler than the premium segment: it was unlikely that there were gourmets who could distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it would be difficult for Ginza Project institutions, he believed.
The Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and their menus.
There will be plenty of time to replace it," said Mironov.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Owners of cafes in the Caucasus and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European cuisine.
But there are many restaurants that will hardly be affected by sanctions.
These include institutions with CIS cuisine: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "You Me!"
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on many dishes - chicken branch, exotic greenery we do not use."
Not one dish has been removed from the menu in Kolbai.
Timura Lansky, owner of Chihona N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not disturbed by the sanctions: he will have to change the lamb into New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
The CIS can be cheaper for cutting, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit.
In doing so, what comes from Central Asia is much better than plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes are known to be delicious, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of Uzbekistan, Ms. Olimbo Artykov, said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by twice by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan stated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of the sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to Deneg's request, also respond calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's stated that localization exceeds 85 per cent and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Department of Supply to Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and the rise in prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In Theme, the “sanctioned products” accounted for no more than 4 per cent.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the walker's paw.
KFC, Burger King and Short Card didn't respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claim that the level of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
♪ On your hump ♪
In the meantime, restorers complain that the demand for price increases even for local products.
"The prices for the Grogley products increased on average by 10-15 per cent, and for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio, twice," says restaurant Roman Roznikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of a meal will increase by 5-10 per cent, recognized by Kolbay.
East West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy production has travelled 10-15 per cent since the beginning of August”.
"The Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork almost twice," complains Sergey Rak, Deputy Director-General of Stardogs.
A short trip of chickens was 35 percent.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll lose their hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, there will be an 8 per cent increase in prices in Stardogs.
Now and so it is very undesirable to raise prices,’ says Cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in general demand for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the lowest since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast: while most restaurants have been stocked for the next two months in the hope of overcoming price fluctuations.
But what happens in two months, no one knows.
There are ten tents decorated with greenery and wood on the square in front of Moscow’s mayor.
In the center of the scene, musicians play waltzes.
It's a regional product festival called "There's Time."
"We were going to celebrate local food at all a long time ago, and here is the sanctions, we rushed, we organized the festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the music scene, the Greek chef Anastas made pasta salad and homemade confetti, and there was a master class in the day to prepare a pineapple with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are assured by the organizers.
The tents are an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Bashkiriya, deer from Salehard, vegetables from Lenin's Sukhoz undertone, cheese from the fallen Italian Jay Clous.
“The salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish bench.
We've got a kidney, a cat, a gerbil, a whale, a king's salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he won't even move.
And you can't hold our Far East salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic mozzarella
In the window of his tent are shrimps with the Magadan Birch, cod, omelet, muxon, mussels from Crimea, mushrooms from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 are more than 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are around 800,000 tonnes.
The "People" bench has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, serving another half dozen restaurants before the sanctions were imposed, such as Simple Things.
Now 15 restaurants have applied to Galkin.
You can make the same land out of our fish, it's hot.
We got wet, tried different recipes.
Now we're selling land through an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are cheaper several times, and our delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin's tent, they're making me a portion of Philadelphia with a cat.
Unlike the roll of the seed, they have to chew longer, but the knowledge that this fish is ours, of course, is a source of strength.
On the website of the "People" bench, there are even rolls from the coat and the sea bass.
In sushi bars, it is true that it is Chilean prefers to replace Norwegian salmon.
Galkin explains this by making laziness to invent new recipes with Far East fish.
“The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us”, explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitri Essev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take up the freed niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLovka Boris Akimova project, it is now possible to replace imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will primarily benefit major producers of other countries," says Akimov.
After all, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal in recent months than the product sanctions.
Three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended as a result of massive extra-planned checks by Rosobnadzor.
“We are studying the substance of the claims submitted to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, said the McDonald's Press Service.
No one really understands what's going to happen next.
If everything is restricted to product sanctions, it is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous employee of a restaurant consulting company.
If they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be completely different.
Europrotocol instead of GIBDD
Casco payments can be obtained without a reference to the GIBDD - so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of a “European Environment” in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain casco payments without a CIBDD certificate.
It is true that it is only when an accident has taken place in the Euro-Euro-Cola without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically affected persons, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As from 2 August, the ceiling for Euro-Euro-Euro-Euro-Euro- around payments is 50,000 rubles and will be increased to 400,000 rubles in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and in Moscow and Leningrad.
The point is that often, even in minor injuries, drivers who are in an accident can be identified as “Euro-Rot around” by DPS.
In the absence of a casco policy, it was not possible to obtain compensation without reference to the GIBDD.
The parameters set out in the draft guideline are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the “European Environment” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cassette payment for the GYBDD-free accident should not be lower than the “European Environment” limit.
However, it cannot be above the limit laid down in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DPS and the road.
But it is likely that neither automotives nor insurers will be thrilled with it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may result in the introduction of new helmet payment rules.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservativeism.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident because it is more reliable.
It is not yet known that it will be easier to defeat the fraudsters or convince the drivers of the reliability of the Euro-Colonel.
Save certificate will be named and non-responseable
Minfin would like to ban saving certificates from the applicant, but would allow banks to make them a non-responsible contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will prohibit the applicant's preservation certificates.
Recently, this instrument has become popular, as rates are higher here than bank deposits.
The point is that the deposit insurance certificate does not fall into the deposit insurance system and the bank is cheaper because it does not have to be credited to the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASA).
The reality of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates and will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem explained in the ASA is that the clients of a small bank that bought such a certificate try to get money from the ASA if they withdraw their licenses.
Some investors, lacking sufficient financial literacy and purchasing savings certificates for the applicant, may assume that their investments are insured.
A reasonable absence of insurance payments for these certificates in the event of a withdrawal of the licence from the bank may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In practice, there have been cases in which holders of certificates of origin have tried to recover insurance through the court," the ASA said.
The problem, of course, is intentional.
Indeed, no one will pay the buyers for the certificates, since they do not have the right to compensation by law from the State.
If the instrument were not insured in the ASA, metallic accounts would be banned along with it, where citizens ' funds are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts do not fall into the deposit insurance system either, but no one will try to exist.
It is likely that the certificates for the applicant are a very comfortable piece of paper that can actually act as quasi-dengues.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and many owners can change such a certificate before it is loaded.
The bill does not provide that the savings certificate must be the exact securities to be kept in the depository.
In order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early repayment.
That is, a similar unrestrained contribution, long-awaited by bankers, is being introduced.

Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will place arms in Iraq to counter the militants of the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting on 31 August ITAR-TASS, referring to the decision taken following the meeting of representatives of the Government of FRG, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 portable Milan missile launchers and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Supply will be effected by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel would make a government statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not placed its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the residents of the FRG on the shipment of arms to Iraqis were shared.
Some believe that it is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia raided a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
Donetsk militias undercut a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, itar-TASS reported on 31 August.
According to available data, this occurred in the Gulf of Tagangrog near the settlements of Shirokino and Beznameno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported two Coast Guard boats being fired.
It is stated that the incident took place today around 16:20.
Adolescents were taken on helicopters from the Blue Mountains
The two Bushookers were taken on a helicopter to a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set out for a walk shortly after noon on Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheit.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they didn't come home.
A search party was sent, including local police and rescue teams, and a couple were found about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were picked up on a swan Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountain Hospital in a stable condition on an ambulance.
Two Unions Meeted
The Minsk summit did not solve the problems for which they had been called, but gave rise to a new format: the first European Union people met with the first people of the future of the Eurasian
Let it be a matter of concern (the situation surrounding Ukraine is not tolerated), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively or not is not understandable; it is clear who removed the plums from the summit.
Questions about this occurred on the evening of 26 August, when the Belarusians followed them and other Europeans with Europeans in the news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader set an example of being polite; it was the behavior of a man who had just broken the Jackpot -- and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to give a final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimacy of the President with 20 years of experience.
This is a request for recognition by the full European policy actor and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research, Dennis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will not be able to speak to Minsk as much as it did before.
"Catherine Ashton's meeting with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be thawed further," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the break-in by the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU — successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization,” says the interlocutor Fireka, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The States have even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves have only undermined the response of the Belarusian leadership.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain relations with Ukraine -- warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all rigour, did not dispute with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the ODCB, and a Russian airbase is stationed in Baranovici.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, the Belarusian experts are confident.
The success of the Lukashenko movement towards political diversification will be reflected in the fact that Minsk will often have to host EU+TS meetings in the near future.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Spokesperson Ashton Maja Kosiancic merely stated that the issue was not a priority in the context of war and peace.
At the same time, it was reported that Kazakhstan could also be the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian issue involving the first persons in the new format.
The Degta Chapel for Minsk became a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he was personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not object to Minsk being a central meeting venue for both the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and the Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that “the last dictator of Europe” is becoming a fully-stricken European leader, helping to solve the global problem.
European Farmer's Best Friend
The composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, has led to the conclusion that the main pillar of the summit is not the tragic situation at Donbass but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supply and on overcoming the concerns of the TC countries on the agreement of Ukraine's association with the EU appears to be more extensive than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Karl De Güht, nevertheless stated: EU representatives “have come to Minsk to find a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences, not vice versa”.
However, the economic crisis in Ukraine seems to be working for Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which has so far experienced the sanctioning pressure, the long-awaited field for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, ex-candidate to the Presidents of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus ' s ability to supply agricultural products to the RF to circumvent sanctions.
In doing so, there are supply schemes that Vladimir Putin rushed to Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes,” stressed Romanchuk “Ognuku”, are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked on delivery schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business urgently needs to be restored in some way, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies have no choice but to make production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials with a Russian market orientation.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trading schemes can now be very much needed.”
According to Romanchuk, the role of the EU and TC negotiating venue is ideal for Lukashenko and for developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions was estimated at between €5 billion and €10 billion, and the European Commission was currently offering only € 125 million in compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on euro-farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko's EU authority to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format, is being baptized, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague, stressed that Kiev had initiated a new format and had become a new one.
“It was your offer to gather, without any delay, to discuss, not from the Baracht Bay, to decide, after the signing of the EU Association Treaty, to examine the situation at that time in Ukraine,” he addressed the Chambers to Petra Poroshenko.
After all, the observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, and it was reportedly initially against Minsk mediation, which greatly enhances its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, Belarus has carefully stressed that, in organizing EU and TC cooperation on its land, Belarus is not pursuing beneficial objectives, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the area of security, are being put forward and promoted by the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation”, said Fireka in the Belarus MlD, an agency where words have recently been scrupulously selected.
In Moscow, pay-per-view zones may appear
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of wage entry zones as a means of combating congestion of central roads in the same way as other major cities of the world, and refers M24.ru, referring to the Moscow Deputy Minister for Transport Maxim Lixutov.
One option that has successfully proven itself is pay-per-view.
It's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, look at all the negatives and benefits.
To say that some decisions have been made so far," said the Lixuts.
Zammera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow, was very important for the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken by those countries was the construction of the central road, and Lixuts added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that all traffic does not have to pass through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure for the tour, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow," the mayor noted.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of paid parking was a major factor in the streets.
And he said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop at what they had achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobianin, attended a ceremony to build the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Boring Wrong
Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez's film "The City of Sins 2: The Woman for Whom It Is Worth Killing" did the wrong revolution that could be expected of him.
The first City of Sins (2005), taken with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comic books and literary nuar.
The Sikvel is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" chain of modern thought (if you mean the nuara universe and, by antithesis, the comic space).
It should now be read as "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
The City of Sins-2 is chaotic both at the dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in a bad sense.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first City, although, here, Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing but manages to capture - as an ethical folk wife - from the air of the knife and other apex with bruises.
But old people are literally lactating new ones, like they're breaking into a city from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which viewers are asking not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly overthrown by the authors in the most interesting place, by the super-happy player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
It's hers with the greedy, frigid Eva Lord and something vengeful about her Dwight.
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, is no different to Johnny's face -- even more so, like other parts of the body, the characters are subjected to relentless regularity, not trouble, not even half victory.
They're not people, we understand that it's the Nuara Archetype: a year-old bitch, too confident of herself a player who liked the "honey trap" of sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype, it's not a movie anymore, it's an abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is just funny.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
The warlords of the First City continue to hold the circular defense against their native slums of the forces of darkness.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost won't, and he'll look at the fire, and it's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem of the City of Sins-2 is another.
Frank Miller was good at being talented in combining the comic book and the nuar, and as a director, he turned his mind on how to move comics to the screen.
The comic book and the nuar are two aggressively opposite “realities”.
The phenomenon of the comic book in modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Deschyl Hammett "The Blood Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Nuara, then called "the hard-boiled school", "the cool school".
Well, it's a pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from Popeye's seaman to the spinach eater, giving him richer power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy's scissor to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other vigilantes.
But in any movie on the basis of comic books, there was something wrong with it: the cartoons did not insist on growing the screen, they remained fakes in their “real” world's will.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence".
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the wars of the world, the traditional novel, with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background, lost all credibility.
What Forsyths, which Tibo and Rugon Makkars, which even Bolkonsky and Rostov are even thinking after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated in the form of a soap opera, and the criminal novel, by definition marginal, rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett found out on his skin what it was like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, they were at least close to the company and the poles of the genre, such as the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Lousey, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nuar, whose archetype they set, first, roughly and cynically, and secondly, purely social.
That's hardly the American option of socialism.
The first City of Sins was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically combined the comic book with the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was revived without any narrowness of its graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the killings and the senator covered the monstrous sadist son, was worthy of Hammett's pen.
And the painting details of the kind of decapitated heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the pens of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best - that is, the declaratively boring - representative of the Neonuar.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a derogation, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stylism--Rodrigues before the comic book tradition.
It's probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second City of Sins, you feel trapped in a glass bowl, inside which the snow sleeps a toy lock.
After all, it's not usually snow, it's blood stains, but what difference does it make?
Well, it's about socialism and nothing to say.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere, we have a girl on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl walking down a curved road or, let's say, tell her inconsolable parents that her executioner is punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city except sin, it is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring as any rule.
Chaos of the City of Sins-2 is boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic roll gave this fresh sin a little but a wig.
The titres warn: The film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the scene, in the very vegetarian episode, which has its fingers broken by a man, it gives him a hell of a sense of humor.
Hammett would love it.
France's Socialists must "shut up and put France in order," says the key ally of Frasua Holland.
Mr. Wall called on the deep-separated left forces to “show a warm attitude” towards the attacking socialist president whose movements had not been endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, applauding.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured him that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the controversial proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his Socialist Party comrade to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobra, Minister of Justice, put the sticks in the wheels, coming to the assembly of disagreeable members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French “to lose faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pé, leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Government of Walla would last more than a few months.
François Allland is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to gather a new government when the previous summer did not last.
"And the new won't last the fall or winter," Mrs. Le Pen said to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and be ready to run.
The ruling party of France suffered a breakdown in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is risking a few rival factions by the end of Mr. Alland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Cyans Po, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to be quickly felt that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The city without drugs" has lost its search.
The Sverdlov Arbitration Court left the Regional State Administration Directorate's claim to the City Without Drugs Foundation without review.
The Board intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as a rental fee for a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitral tribunal of the Sverdlov Region has left the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (IMGISO) to the “Town Without Drugs” Foundation (one of the founders, Eugeny Roiseman, Mayor of Yekaterinburg).
The regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting the building.
Today, it was known that the plaintiff had not appeared before the court twice, which led to a decision to refuse the hearing.
The reasons for the lack of representatives in the IGASO Directorate were not explained, but the Chief of Legal Division, Maxim Titov, did not respond to the telephone calls.
It was also not possible to contact representatives of the Fund.
Remember, this is a man who held a fund in the centre of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a grant basis since 2011.
This decision was taken by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Public Property Management Directorate of the Sverdlov Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlov Arbitration Court for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the department had requested, through the court, that a contract for the use of the monument be recognized as unpaid.
In the view of the ICGISO Directorate, the agreement did not contain significant conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlov arbitral tribunal dismissed the action and then appealed to the 17th arbitral tribunal of Permi, which had been granted.
The fund then filed a cassation complaint to the same court, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Foundation to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease was concluded, under which the fund began to pay the rent again, as told by the head of the city of Evgeny Roiseman.
The rent was set at 300,000 rbs per month.
The previous district administration has handed over this building to us for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs as a tribute to the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise," he said.

Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was invited to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg, a unicorn, Alexander Kosintsev, invited the mayor of the town, the Speaker of the Pride of Evgenia Roiseman, to resign.
The case involved a criminal case involving a suspect in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Oleg Kineva, who was considered an associate of the mayor.
How did Eugenia Roiseman find a criminal case?
On 1 July, it was known that a criminal case had been instituted in the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenia Roizman, “defiled” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code).
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, where Anna Filatov, Director of the Legal Centre for Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roiseman accused her of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband in her blog.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that this is another attempt to avenge the truth.
iPhone turns into a purse
In advance of 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, the American media report that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile purse function as a result of the Apple joint project and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code's specialized Internet resource, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express at the presentation of new products on 9 September, making the new iPhone 6 smartphone available as a mobile purse.
Companies themselves have given up any comment on this.
This function allows you to pay on a store register using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time incorporate NFC technology (near field communication), which allows you to make an uncontacted payment using a smartphone and a corresponding reading device on the cassette.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and hundreds of other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the advancement of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented the Google Wallet system to allow users to attach bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
In fact, American experts stress that, despite major investments by high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, US retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores by such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into the market will still make the Reuters accelerate and more actively implement the technology at its trading points.
MlD France: Paris’s position on transfers to Russia, Mistralej, does not change
France's official representative, Roman Nadal, said that Paris was in an unwavering position with regard to the supply of Mistral-type helicopters to Russia.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Françua Ollanda) in his interview with Le Monde on 20 August: “Today’s level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not France," said Mr. Nadal "RIA Novosti.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy agency replied to the question whether the deterioration in the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris ' s position on the implementation of the contract

Norwegian Cruise is approaching the $3 billion Prestige Cruises deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secured customers of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with major rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, sources reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise's shares.
Sources requested to remain unnamed as negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise vessels that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She claimed income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India in the years to come.
Racers seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the primary public distribution of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after $850 million in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Cok Tei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 per cent in companies reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise route in North America, according to registration documents at the first public location of Prestige Cruises shares.
Crimea Television Company can receive 250 million rubles of grants
In the Russian MinCommunication, it is proposed that the state television company Crimea be allocated 250 million roubles in 2014.
According to the draft MinCommunication Regulation, which provides information on the preparation of regulations on a single portal, the grant is intended to be “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also go to purchase equipment, repair roofs and power supply systems in a tele radio company building founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Activists of the Democratic Movement of Hong Kong tear down a Chinese representative's statement the day after the election decision is taken
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Assembly established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of the Head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first be supported by the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be filled with Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and has forced democratic activists to again promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre by protesting the Occupy Central.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing ' s publication on China ' s control over Hong Kong, in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and struck a seated strike.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of People's Representatives, Zhang Rongshong, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of State Council, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to give a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would meet at the Hong Kong Government building in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is related to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the takeover of the territory on Sunday and commissioned the military to establish an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the Gaza Strip representative Saiba Arikat, the world community should call upon Israel to respond for “continuing settlement activity on the west coast of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to start negotiations on “Statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting with separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of a separate region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin had no intention of implying that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s appeal to the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy that it follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take over the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to draw closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with the State's First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk areas, which was captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territories New Russia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolution days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies began campaigning for the 26 October parliamentary elections and while government forces were attacking peaceful settlements in secessionated regions, the prisoner of illusions reported itar-TASS.
“We must immediately begin substantive negotiations and not only on technical matters, but also on the political system of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words on Statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed over the months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to defuse fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of press secretary of the Kremlin to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin's words stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist uprising in a different way east than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have had to endure a much more difficult battle to join even Donetsk and Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and interviews prior to the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would allow regional governments in Ukraine to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by transferring the Kremlin to actual control of the territory that would link Russia's main territory with the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, is home to the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and the Crimea, there are also mines, factories and lithium factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko proposed, during his inauguration speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh amendments to the Constitution, allowing separate regions to exercise greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to differ greatly from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arms and instigation are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equals, followed the new insurgency last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of Novoazovsk in the onset of which Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the start of a campaign to take over strategic coastal territory to Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port from 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoazovo and the narrow passage to the Crimea peninsula.
Dustenko asked the European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," said Dustenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficult separatists, Colonel Andrew Lysenko, Spokesperson of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilovajsk as a result of the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lisenko reported on Sunday.
A naked photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen the naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged by the fact that a number of frank photographs depicting Jennifer Lawrence naked are online as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 frank photos of the Star of the Hungry Games, Lawrence and the superstar, including Kate Upton and Kara Deleven, the singers Rianne, Ariane Grande and Leah Michel, and actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Stratovski, and a resident in Melbourne also allegedly stole photos as a result of a leak with iCloud.
On the list of 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who made Greco's proposal last month, said Confidite, "That's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “disgusting” and that those to whom it was directed “feeled that they had invaded”.
The hacker is expected to have 30 photos of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames, where he is lying at a pool with a naked chest.
Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of "Chuck" Stratovski and actress from the "Prohibited Party" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ: "This is a sudden invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his resentment at the hacker, tweeting: “Teaching photos stolen from a mobile phone is in fact nothing different from selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
A potential method of stealing photos of naked celebrities has been discovered.
The massive break-in of star accounts may have been caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario for developments was described by the resource The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github that allowed you to choose passwords for the Find My Phone service by Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
It uses the same login and password link as Apple ID to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which the photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allows you to read the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author claimed that the number of passwords entered was unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and the user informed of the attempted break-in.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of attempts to access the password to their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, the vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to select passwords.
Vulnerability is currently closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the “star” account.
It's not me, it's RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again appeared foreign recordings
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability has been used to steal photographs in Find My Phone, there has already been a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the safety of the cloud had not been compromised but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter has also been hacked.
If the conspirators had access to iCloud described above, there could also be a password to the head of government account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web could not get Apple comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-year-old
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Burjak.
The relevant decree is published on the legal information web portal.
Earlier this year, an athlete moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and requested the Federation of Modern Five Fighters to give her the opportunity to stand up for a composite RF.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the European Silver Medal in personal primacy and became the world champion in a mixed relay, which is one of the new types of sports programme.
It also holds leadership positions during the current season.
According to the rules, in order to address the Olympics-2016 in Rio de Janeiro, it will need a special authorization from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Burjak was not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Russian chess player Ekaterina Lagno - urzenko Lvova, who is a double champion of Europe (2005, 2008), a world of lightning (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of Ukraine's women's team, she won the World Cup in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
CRC halted investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (RCC) dropped the criminal case of the crash of the aircraft Tu-204 by Red Wings.
This is reported by the press department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and of the aircraft crew.
The forensics have shown that the cause of the disaster has been an increased rate of approach to landing, failure by crews of standard landing procedures, and unintended release of engines to increased direct traffic.
Red Wings, followed by the Prague-Moscow flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 at the Vnukovo Moscow airport.
The aircraft climbed over the runway and burned down.
At the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the flight attendant were killed.
Two of the drivers were taken to treatment facilities, where the injuries later died.
Three more drivers hospitalized with severe bodily injuries have undergone long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle was seriously injured at the time of the Kiev Road accident.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office conducted a post-disaster inspection in Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed operation in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emilianenko began training in SIZO
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Emilyanenko, 33 years old, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault against a female worker, has fully recovered from injuries and has begun training.
That's what the Championship says.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexandre Emilianenko with rape.
The suspect was reported wanted and was detained in Tambov on 9 May following a car accident that resulted in a hip fracture.
Emelianko-young person was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court was adjourned and the investigation insisted that the period of detention be extended until 30 September.
If an athlete's guilt is proven, he is liable to imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
Lenta.ru recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emellianenko's career.
Emilianenko spent his last match in January this year, losing his technical knockout to his compatriot, Dmitry Sozinski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the better-known fighter Fedor Emellianenko.
The latter is the four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, the four-time world championship and the seven-time Russian combat samba champion.
Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of man.
The angry expression of the person is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats that scientists in Australia and the United States have found.
They described their findings in Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the brows that have been lifted down and dropped down, the lips that have been stretched out into thin lines, the nostrils that have been spread out in all cultures - makes them even blind since the birth of the children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has arisen for the effective handling of disputes during conflict.
The more physical harm one person can inflict on another, the more he has the ability to dictate his or her circumstances, the more he brings them to the interviewer with the help of anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more angry and are turning to handicrafts, consider themselves capable of imposing disadvantages on others, and prefer strong methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
In view of the fact that anger is primarily “the emotion of the trade”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create the angry expression of the person should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus make it possible to agree to his terms as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer persons who had or were absent from each of the seven elements of the angry person and showed them to the information.
Although the brows that had been dropped or the chin that had been put forward had not alone made the person evil, the more powerful physical participants in the study agreed unanimously on the characteristics of the person.
Man’s anger, like that of animals, threatens to exaggerate his own self - force, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man blows his nostrils and pulls his lips for the same purpose as a bloated frog, or a baboon that demonstrates its klicks.
“The anger is “began” by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately adopts a form that demonstrates as effectively as possible the consequences of the rejection.
But the most amazing -- that no component of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tubi.
The Mincommunity has proposed to provide 250 million roubles of Crimea television.
