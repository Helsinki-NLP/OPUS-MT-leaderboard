Parliament did not support the liberation amendment for Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament has rejected the proposal to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of a prisoner of expression, was rejected by the Members on second reading of the proposal to mitigate penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in October for concluding an alleged disadvantageous contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not binding, the appeal of the convicted person is to be heard by the court in December.
Timoshenko refers to the verdict as political revenge of the regime, suspicions of court involvement have also sparked a trial in the West.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 from the Penal Code, on the basis of which the expert was convicted, supported the vote of 147 Members.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already defeated its own.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
There's still a winner to be defined.
As is the custom in the region, Islamists win the election, but it is whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied for the customary law of Sharia, and we already have an idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because a hand is cut off for stealing.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There'll be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we wouldn't want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor the best objectively, and it is likely that it would not suit the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it's surprising that the Islamic warriors took thanks by means of non-believers dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view, a general from America did not drive NATO attacks, but Allah, whose size was celebrated in every act of conduct.
So when the winners are found in Libya, the west is not one of them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya is not militarily occupied.
That's where the problem with the "crossbows" is falling off the ground.
But without the occupation of the oil company, they'll have Libyan black gold as a sponge?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast about the unrealistic protection of human rights.
So unless we're told by those pious law-abiding men.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have entered the investors' search
The statistical crash took place on Tuesday through Europe.
Individual countries published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, Germany and France are growing.
But today's debt market is breaking record.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (growth by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France said that it appeared slightly below 0.1% (the original data referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5% year-on-year in this third quarter.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated over a quarter of a year, and according to the Czech Republic, the trend has been confirmed by the gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
The Czech economy increased by 1.5% year-on-year in this third quarter, but stagnated over a quarter-year.
The German economy increased by 0.5% in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The euro area and the European Union's economy increased by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The income of Italian and Spanish bonds is growing to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Income for Czech 10-year bonds is held below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, there are votes that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and celebrate the process for 200 million
The football team has accomplished the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech Republic and the beautiful gate Petra Jirák won 1-0.
Czech football, with a large portion of happiness in the second half, has been taking a luxurious lead in domestic retaliation and will not be missed again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz watched a procedural match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech team also won a 1-0 victory in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship thanks to its home-made death in the end, the great Czech Republic and the hero Jiráček.
Because of the precise defense of the Czech population, the Montenegrins were under pressure until the second half.
The fighters became Damjanovich with Vukinič, who burned down two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter Čech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championships next year, in addition to the prize of about 200 million crowns.
There's been a lot of combat football since the opening minutes.
Both teams just had a hard time getting involved in the combination, and it was mostly about a half line.
The pressure of domestic football players did not therefore come in the first half, because the Czech defenses were precisely deterred by the long cracks for defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme before the possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, at noon, the students prayed and then called the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a living shield on Tuesday around the Isphahan nuclear technology centre where uranium is processed.
They thus reveal that they are ready to defend the nuclear program of their country with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its recent report that Iran has apparently not stopped pursuing nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is spoken of in Israel.
In the afternoon before entering the Isphahan nuclear facility, the students prayed and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack to the greatest extent possible to cripple Iran's nuclear programme, the Israeli press would also have the objective of a facility in Natanz in which uranium is enriched, in addition to the Isphahan centre.
Eater of the obese child: doesn't eat breakfast and dinner snacks
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with over 9 percent of schoolchildren and 5 percent of children obese.
Obesity children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows and the patterns in which it is surrounded.
For example, the table of obese children shows up up to half as often as in normal - weight families.
Fried French fries had to be eaten the day before a research related to an educational event called Obesity is no coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
In the families of fat people, it is also not the custom to play sports, which is true for most of the families of today’s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 elementary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th grade have been involved in the project.
Proper eating and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of those questioned, for example, said that five times a day in the breakfast-swine-svačina-svačina-svačina mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and evening snacks
Experts point out that for healthy development there are important and relative details, including regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast on his own.
And the worst part was finding out that in a dozen households you don't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unwholesome fries are more common in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although she regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, the result was less than half of the 15 percent in their parents.
Get your menu together.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to assemble their own menus according to their own taste and opinion.
"The nutritional preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of flour, meat and sweet food.
"An alarm is particularly a great favourite of sweet lemons," the final survey report said.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won right over the poultry.
But the children did not want any shellfish at all, and they are also the low likeness of fish and midday vegetables.
A Healthful Appeal
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the completion of the Obesity Education Lecture there is no coincidence, in a number of cases there has been a marked shift of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project said.
Markant, for example, was in sweet lemons, where more children would take precedence over ordinary water.
Children have also much more often crossed out in the questionnaire poultry and fish as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard professionals
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I complained so little that it was already a lot in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing up problematic figures and a seminar on how to go to the place.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "stuck."
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly balanced character.
And that's what most of them are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy's figure without a straight curve, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We were given tips like Jennifer Lopez's, i.e. bigger tits and hips and a tight waist, a figure to point out and at the same time not to dress a woman too challengingly.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is such that skirts or pants really do not fit, then it pays to have at least one such piece sewn in peace.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfect clothes are unpaid.
In a dress of peace, you will feel much better than in one that is constantly moving, shivering, falling off the waist and so forth.
The boy figure can afford to wear clothes with abrasion, apps, embroidery, or recruitment.
Such information and types of characters are, of course, a lot, so I'm glad I have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that given the assigned homework, it's all there is to it.
Each of the courses received assigned celebrity, which is designed to invent two outfits: daily and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the individual and the type of character.
I'm gonna "put on" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret.
In my spirit, I'm sure it's better for me personally than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take it from above) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes off of the magazines or search the Internet and print it and then graphically process it.
Moodboard, as the result is called, will then express our personal style and relationship to graphic creation.
It is important to think about the graphic page of styling.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but he also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for example, for specific tasks such as handbag trends, coats, etc.).
A stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday’s lecture, filled with information about the types of characters, was given by three guests in the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variety is key in this case.
So, for example, such a t-shirt (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and shirts like a coat, but you can also wear it on a bare body, footwear boats and paint it as a dress.
Or just up your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different right now.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
So I finally understand why we are shivering at all the lessons we can combine, why, and why, even in fashion magazines, we see something else.
I don't even talk about shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have a lot more options than how many of them are going to take pictures.
So at the fascist story that's going to have ten sides (then ten outfits), I have to be ready to "encourage" at least fifteen.
And also that the picture of the clothes looks and works in combination with other bits of lechda quite differently than in fact.
So we have to count on this when we create an outfit.
That the image and style makes the leches up to half the success, we have been confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to stylist services is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces consider him useless (but I know something, the way I look is second-rate).
And if someone is already letting us create styling, then we have to count on them to give us a completely different (less) size than they really do.
Then it is not left to Google and to see if the boulevard has written about the fact that the celebrity in question has lost weight and so on.
Honza and Mario put their hearts on Sundays that stylists are not enough to be fashion oriented and to be able to form an outfit.
In his work he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not to encourage them, to stand up for themselves.
"When you're ordered by some manager to dress her up and add nice pieces, you can't throw her out of the closet and say, "Oh, my God, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things there that you will commend and recommend what they can wear," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain a so-called "placenta" or a bag on the square.
It's the one you turn on around the waist and you have all the props you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there are also nylon thread (with which stylist assists in taking pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clips that will be put on the back of the garment if it is larger (the pin or other clamp is not allowed, they would destroy the garment), or the stitch.
In order not to listen, but also to try something out, we learned how to bend our shoes properly.
Even when you take pictures in an studio where there's a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch each other with our shoes so they don't get hurt.
Therefore, skill is really needed.
Mario pleased me when my creation commended me without reservation.
This skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend course.
I'm beginning to understand that it's not really a walk in the pink garden that anyone wants to know what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Reviews
Initially, reckless driving changes due to a series of completely unnecessary Lydhaic mistakes into a routine morning trip to the summit.
Although ambition has been largely fulfilled, it is not valid when no one apparently wanted to do anything extra.
A new subtitle entitled The Run was awakening high expectations before the release.
He promised that in the summer race series Need for Speed would once again move a little bit in a new direction and from playable shows appeared like a game that should not only be counted in the genre of action.
We were also curious about how they would get into the folded passages in which the main hero would get out of the car and run his way.
As with the NFS series, however, many are a little different from what we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series for more than a few years.
So they're not actually mistakes, but rather some kind of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has some personal problems and as a solution is offered participation in an illegal race across America.
You'll be seated behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea brings with it some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on another track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
Man doesn't even have the feeling that the game is still offering the same thing.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-class thing.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seem visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are occasionally characterized by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you are drawn to a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you must be careful not to fall asleep in the avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are well behind them.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to get ahead of the desired number of opponents (in fact a classic race), then you catch up with time (a classic match with feet) and then you're going to have a duel with a single opponent.
The police will be involved from time to time, and your efforts will continue to cause further embarrassment.
The news is that the passenger's out of the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack mostly runs away from someone, and you have to help him by typing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that these passages are much less in play than you would expect (in particular, only three).
As a result, however, it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not stand a chance to become annoying, and in the context of the above, it follows the elements that make the game grow.
The driving model follows in the tracks of the previous parts.
That means it's definitely not more now, but you can't say it's a repugnant one.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-oriented racing of the local driving model is still quite good, although we could find a better one in competition.
Until then, everything is perfectly all right.
But problems are beginning to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very good.
We do not expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but when you have virtually no idea of how your car will behave before you have any impact on any object, then perhaps everything is not quite all right.
Typically, when you drive closely or pass cars in normal traffic, you only lick each other lightly, but sometimes in almost identical situations your car will end up in wild pyruets.
Or even go straight for it.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't bother you at all, but it'll make you feel better.
The restarts are solved so that if you smash or drive away from the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
However, only five are available in each race.
If you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help in case something doesn't work out than you can rely on them.
Sometimes, however, the restarts do not help, they will be solved until they need to learn a certain part of the race to remember.
The big problem with the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you will not fit in.
Other times you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
Especially in situations where you see a rival passing easily before you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
All the time you're playing, you're gonna run into a few places where, no matter how long it takes, you're always gonna be run by the same opponent in the same place.
Most of it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you're heading in the opposite direction.
The opponent must be there before you at all costs.
When he's ahead of you, he's making it worse for you to get a look at the cars he's driving, so at first, you're going to be able to spread out a little bit.
You can understand the intention to make the game more tense and adrenaline-y, but the performance is so obvious that it will reliably quickly desensitize you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places even so actionful that sometimes you literally don't get to watch where it flies.
And it doesn't really matter if it's worth the concept of 50 unique lines, of ranking races so that boredom doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to switch cars during races.
You have to watch out for the petrol pumps by the road, because that's where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you've had enough with what you've got.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The athletes are suitable for urban areas, strong American roadside bumpers and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example after the clicks of mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and fashion challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
To get a higher level of drivers, different items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time it is connected again with the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car, you will reach the subway tunnel (building) where you find it in the dark in the tracks (building).
On the tachometer, the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h are flashing, and in the back, a set of subways will be hit and will uncompromisingly tear you down.
In the paper, we will have a discussion for a few days about whether no one really thought of us or whether the authors think we are really that big of a jerk.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes up so that in some of the moments, it decreases in some of the moments, and in some cases, it is tragically tragic.
However, this is mainly the case with a larger number of participants, when a smooth shot would no longer be valid for you.
The sound page is fine and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to like the widest scale of the younger audience, a soundtrack from the category "every dog of another village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, it is not likely that someone will buy the game.
Overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so much disappointed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in recent years.
This is how the game seems incomplete.
It's definitely fun, but get ready to be struck in the eye by the force of airport lights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenam:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has severely disrupted the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stand still, calm down and before all players get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicen, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To the extent that she takes her motto "Acceptably and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of her lecture when she was able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could be envied by a number of lecturers from the UK Law School.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First there was a criticism that he was indistinguishable, that he was a grey official, that he couldn't play any part, and I must say that everyone was breathless, that the role was played excellent."
"He is a man who can listen to and communicate with twenty-seven Member States and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy explained in response to the question: "Who is this European Union? To which phone number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards unifying and making EU policies more readable to countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from cheeses.
Vicen also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of Pre-Lano has declared it a success.
The Czechs have solved the upcoming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or organised a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time marked a great negativity, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very urgent.
In the words of the ambassador, the "fact of fremol" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being resolved today.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is making the current economic situation very difficult.
Whether the budget will be concise and cost-effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which are less, is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "O Europe is understandable".
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, a hangover that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that in Brussels there are really no curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that someone really has to ban cheeses."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe ahead of us
According to the Ambassador, Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who are more aware of the negative than the positive side of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Trust me that when Polack and Hungary come to see me and the Slovak is approaching, the Frenchman next to me will say, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad four again?"
In the future, according to Vicenová, there are mainly new hard rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As very real, it perceives the concept of a dual-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation."
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have space for Schengen, we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only countries that want to cooperate and those who don't want to stand back."
"These institutes will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all topics affecting the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.

IBM innovator begins its second century existence
If someone was looking for a word that would most accurately express the IBM strategy, it would probably be "longevity".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as very modern, and yet it has been established for a hundred years.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" thus became a fingerprint, around which the life of a future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more," current director Samuel J. Palmisano noted on the anniversary.
Processed system
Watson took care of his employees in the 1930s, as did the businessman Batja in the Czech Republic - the people from IBM had a paid vacation as one of the first American employees, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-designed system for the remuneration of the best inventors and traders.
The customer's long-term IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it has abolished any discrimination, so it has been able to choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will be replaced next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
It has been operating in IBM for 30 years, still stands the position of sales manager, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called pits in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations are emerging.
No wonder the ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institution with a good name
A firm position in business is ensured by its firm's strong internal and external image.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said economist Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as its logo in the United States makes it its family name - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
They hold the most patents from all American technology companies and five of their employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, payment card, financial swap, line code or diskette.
IBM became the second largest technology company in terms of market capitalization (first Apple) this year, when Microsoft for the first time since 1996 preceded IBM.
Front view
Not all products and innovations have been hit in the taste of customers and times - IBM for example did not bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy service or IBM PCjr computer.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they do not work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
In IBM sales, services are the most involved, and after about a fifth of them are software and hardware.
As early as 1990, he was the most powerful hardware representative with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same time invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the world’s first financial crisis has gone too far.
IBM is following the link of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.
The price of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company's net profit is constantly increasing.
The company's IBM password is to change everything, just not its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Flights to Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally called Computer Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over in 1924 - originally a brand used for branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM was a merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as famous "snatches," that is, hours recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory board of the company until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson's competition manager to help him run the company.
The leader then shaded the founder of IBM - an insurmountable company culture and identity is built on Watson's ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began to produce and sell all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cashiers.
During the first four years Watson was in charge, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began extensive expansion of the company to all worlds.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior, after almost 40 years in the boss' chair.
Under his guidance IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA fly flights into space - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "pétété", which established the computer standard at the time, named IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of the computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to give full advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has paid off in the last three years of IBM is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planets".
Its aim is to use technology wisely in unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in urban transport or management.
For the area of trade, the IBM platform "Smarter Commerce" has recently been introduced to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, apart from IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team of the world level dealing with voice recognition.
A speedboat about an unfaithful husband:
Yvette, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtárová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richtár (53) became the protector of Iveta Bartosh (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait, and she's laid down clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained Rychtárová.
When Darina Rychtár in the summer provided shelter for Bartosh in her home, she did not seem to be able to finish her marriage.
Even though Iveta moved away after 30 days of insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted to loving her.
During the course of time, Darin resigned, made peace with her husband’s relationship, and now even gave him his farewell forever.
The waiter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Richter and Bartosh break up once, he won't be waiting for his wife's open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will expel him."
"But he will experience him not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtár said, saying that she had already left her husband and insisted only on mutual courtesy.
Joseph's fact that Darina closed his back door doesn't bother him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will be with Yvette, and I will not change it."
"The wife set up a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company keeps going, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I have a perfectly normal time, just that we don't share a bed together," said Lightning Hunter.
If Rychtář also found new love, she won't be able to stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, or if he has any boyfriends.
I know it's my fault, I've fallen in love with Iveta and I'm taking all the responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst women's habits: Are you involved?
When you ask men if they can name any typical female vices, usually everyone in one is very quick to spill out of the sleeve.
My dear women, will you meet in the following lines, where a number of women's habits are listed, which make it possible for men to perfectly pump blood into their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one suit a week?
Do you shop in discounts and in stores?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least ease their shopping passion.
But tell me, who would resist just going through the clothing stores, looking for well-falling tops, and then try them all (ideally in different colourful performances) in the booth?
For most women, shopping is a hobby, but for men, it can literally become a complete hell.
Just remember, how many times have you told your family to wait for you before the front door...
Continuous Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these words remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless wheel.
Wash the windows, vacuuming, washing the tiles, dusting, bathing - at least twice a week.
Are you mad at your partner for stepping on a dirty foot on a clean slate, to the kids for squeezing out a washed-up sink and covering a glass living room with which you put so much work into your polishing?
If you are suffering from this very "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and orderly and cleanliness should definitely not stand within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship and family well - being.
Extinguishing
"You used sweatpants throw in the basket."
"You'll wear your old socks tomorrow too?"
"The wet wipe doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner this way several times a day, know that you can safely turn him around.
Of course you don't mean anything by it, but you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Controversy, gossiping
For some women there are also gossips, gossips, as well as insults and associations against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, who, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release some harmless gossip or slander there.
Hands on your heart, it's yours to all women.
On the other hand, the gossip of the rudest grains, which they like and often gossip about, perhaps despise each other and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's working group.
Jagre and Voráček helped assist to win Philadelphia
Hockey Attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in Monday's NHL match with two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the perspective of a ninety-year-old star he won in both cases Claude Giroux, who added one more game and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jagra's teammate Jakub Voráček.
Jagret told overseas journalists that Giroux had a big night ahead of him.
"I told him before the game he'd give a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jagre, after which Giroux scored from the first shooting of the Flyers.
A little later, the second strike of the team had a Czech trail.
Voráček fought behind the goal of the Hurricanes wheel and presented it among the circles scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break he reduced in weakening domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jagret, he scored the third goal, then his shot retold running in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs among the best three," appreciated Jagr of his centre.
"I never thought I'd play hockey with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play it."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning," added Jag.
Caroline from the match made a drama, scored Tuoma Routua, and again Dwyer, who was forced by the crime of shooting, got the difference between one goal.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who completed the recalculation of two into one.
"He's done a great job in our "Pronger" band."
"I blew out the wheel, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the further pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last goal of the match from his point of view of Voráček.
Philadelphia has won the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win the match against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned for injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens lost two-part lead next to the experienced beck and lost after the penalty shot 2:3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points felt sorry for the large stalemate in the back row, with only five defenses playing the game.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The line-by-the-shifting was rolling on us, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game more, move the puck out of our band."
In this we had gaps," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 strikes to Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters split up about the Jets goals, which interrupted the five-stage series of losses.
How Travel Prices developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc in a crushing majority, since travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists thus travelled on vacation to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi na Krym near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime bowed to the West and the journeys of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the era of socialism was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise it was not an individual trip.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand up overnight with the sleeper or to have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
However, that was not the case.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not made to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely variable currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) to travel to the West.
The Czechs, however, often spent their vacations in the country, which resulted in a large number of chats and cottages that the Czechs had acquired, and this habit is still alive today.
The journey of the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 she was vacationed in NDR or Bulgaria with our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the present most popular Croatia until 1989, since it was part of Yugoslavia.
Immediately in the late 1990s, visa waivers occurred in neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria's Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough trips to the West for a while, everybody wanted to look at it.
In Paris, for example, Czech tours in parks in tents slept, since our incomes back then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of the Czechs' journey was at this time driving their own food, cans, salami, etc. to be spared.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely interchangeable Czech crown, finally allowing our tourists to buy the Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and our average wages have risen, which led to another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have been regularly preparing flights with charter airlines since 1997, making it impossible for airlines to negotiate quantitative discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had a visa-free relationship in virtually all the advanced countries of the world, except the United States, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolving travel occurred right in 2000, when due to a considerable demand it was shipped from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, they have been flying straight charters with Czech tourists to warm remote countries every year, and this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US cancelled a visa for Czech tourists and thus our country was definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history, including spending more than CZK 15 000 per person on a foreign holiday.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but again, there is a danger of suffering.
Almost five months of Czech football without the president and the threat is that the successor Ivan Hasek, headed by the Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR), will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place in Nymburca on Thursday.
There is still no agreement under which electoral rules will be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of leading Czech football is from Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned from his post in June and called on his departure colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hashka era, football slipped back to the heels between the two union chambers that couldn't agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met needlessly at the National House in Prague, because the proceedings remained blocked and it was not only a way of choosing.
In fact, there was no agreement as to who has the right to vote in the assembly - whether it is only the statutory representatives or the full powers of the officials.
In this single point, there has been partial agreement since then, which has also been the result of the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law under which full representation is not possible.
However, there is still controversy about the electoral order.
He did not bring the situation too clearly into the hands of the executive committee, which no longer resolves at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, in essence.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to follow the positions or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represented professional football in the management of the association.
According to the designs of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win, which will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to the concession to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side insists on the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds advantage on this percentage.
"Only then would that make sense of the two previous rounds, this would totally deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian side of Freedom, which would be the best way not to move and vote according to applicable regulations.
Tomáš Paclík is also somewhat surprised to agree with this, although it is estimated that the statutes set out by the electoral rules are the most appropriate for all candidates to meet Pelt.
"I wish that it was elected according to the statutes."
"To avoid making up a lot of nonsense as for the last general assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who ran for the first time and in his statements was primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be known and believes that candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All passionately calms down today's national team's process for the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, it will be more willing to cooperate," says the Jablonetic official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more restrained.
"I hope it's a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divisive."
"It is not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there is an effort to adapt to the rules."
"This may cause the blockage of the general assembly to occur again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
There's not much time left for all parties to agree on.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, who knows if the football general will be complete in the game.
The Air Special, in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not fly from Prague in the morning because of a technical malfunction and sought a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the Barage Revenge.
Finally, a ministerial-level decision-making meeting is likely to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Affairs Josef Dobeš would like to bring the divided parties inside the strongest sports association in the country into agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football, and also a general assembly of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport towards the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is fighting for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football team of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary general assembly who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR), he would not have applied for the top position.
"If a quality adept exists, I fight for it and I don't go to the election."
"But in the current situation no one has been able to find anyone like this," said ČTK Paclík.
In a fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rajchl, the wife of Paclík was motivated to try and stop Pelt, allegedly the favorite of the election, on his way to the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that if he won, he would only be able to hold the presidency until 2013, when there is a proper general assembly on the programme.
He would like to see an experienced and top-notch manager who is not too connected to football.
"I've spoken to some people who would consider it."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify themselves with Czech football right now."
"That's the view I'd like to change," he said.
Paclík is now most disturbed by Pelt's connection with the chairman of the Plzeň Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to become Presidential.
"If he had won, the state of the art would be preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a skilled trader, it would not be even more beneficial for football," Paclik said.
He also points out that Pelt’s name sounded in his letters years ago during an investigation into the corruption affair, but Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking his earlier statement "sold the Pilsen Club if Pelta became chairman".
If Paclik triumphed in the Thursday election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, is also considering, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But managers couldn't run an association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who in September raised a lot of attention by standing behind the appeal of the panel of judges led by Human Macella, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
The thumb says he'd be trying to run the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, since last summer he also heads Plzeň, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Premier League Triumph.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which should tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals commission, which goes to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not share his antipathies, for example, with Spartan chief Daniel Krzetinski.
He would also consider it a priority to tighten relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby for more money from the lottery tax in political peaks.
"It is one of the key things the new president should be dedicated to."
"If gambling occurs, as the political parties say, I understand their argument, but they have to say where the money goes," he noted.
As a hindrance now Paclík does not even take his connection with the Pilsen Club, although he himself claims that the Chairman of the FAČR should be "straight".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec again, Rajchl with the Prague Dukloa.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see the point in having to cover someone's stock at the Plzeň club and then back in a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that would exclude the election pat
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that, if elected, they would sit down and have new positions which would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburce and believes that the election fight will significantly dampen today's success of the football team.
Pelta already promised, before the election in September, that he would focus on the representation and acquisition of finance in case of election.
In the election before the last general meeting, he decided to go at the last minute, so he could use a two-month delay to defend and present his ideas about football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"It feels like it is high time for someone to lead the association," says a man who is linked primarily to the Jablonetic club, but who has served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
And that's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that there is euphoria behind the current election problems that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, in the June general meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not allow different interpretations, we had the president since September," Pelt warned.
He has just adopted the revision of the most important document of the civil society as a branch of delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he's still trying not to define himself against his rivals.
He had already come to see that he could imagine working with Henry Reichl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"There's something going on in football over a year, he's got some success."
"His attacks, however, were unworthy, and many people in the way of the election campaign came to a halt."
"That is why a number of them now doubt his real character," said Pelta, who said at the opponent's address, who remained loyal to the proclamations he had already announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest contests to the team.
It should be a display closet for football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemian cause or the sound of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately engage in negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the whole football," the Czech Republic's six-year-old candidate said two months ago.
Then he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any staff cleaning.
"I would have to get acquainted with the loads of individual employees first," Strahov said, where there is understandable nervousness from long-term turmoil.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the general assembly, they believe that they will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how he's going to vote in the third round, we can get through it."
"Football needs credibility, and it only gets it by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains two days before perhaps the decisive day of her function career as an optimist.
Rajchl promises that under him the FAČR would work hard
If the new Chairman of the Czech Republic Football Association was elected to the Thursday General Assembly by the current Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
It wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian cause, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that President Ivan Hasek had begun.
"As president, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Richl said in an interview for the Czech Republic.
"I am a team player, and I want to share competences in the executive committee so that each member of the board can devote himself to a certain area."
"And I'm going to be handing out hard tasks to move the football a mile ahead in each of these segments."
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticising the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will keep throwing sticks at my feet and questioning every step of the way," he explained why he hesitated.
"Many people told me not to give up, because then others would give up."
"This is a trust that I cannot just throw away," he said.
He's also motivated by the continuing work he started with The Hague.
"In the last two years, a big piece of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are ongoing processes that will have a sound, perhaps in a few years, and I do not want anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation on the union could return to the time before The Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"He is primarily followed by people who would do football so that he would be chosen only."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm sure it's not that I'm a stranger."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the choice," said Rajchl.
He also refutes the claim that he would be only the Czech President.
"Although some people are trying to argue otherwise, I intend to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would split into Czech and Moravian parts whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be such a current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Richl said.
Since Tomáš Paclík, head of the Plzeň Club, also took part in the fight for the president, he dares not have Rajchl guessed his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers it a success to save tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiate television contracts and negotiate a lottery law.
On the contrary, he takes it as a complicity that the union does not pull a rope.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning the Czech football trust", the second of Paclík's rivals considers him a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can doubt that Plzeň has done a great job this year."
"If he was elected, he would perhaps continue with the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist it for his own good," says the Rajchl rival.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
The boulder from the perspective of Ufona, a proud swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after sightseeing cities or traveling let his tired feet rest in thermal baths.
The book will show you where wellness is most beautiful by water.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half years on discovery trips, she should not have missed her swimsuit in her luggage.
Lying a hint on the water, she looked up to heights in artificial domes, swam across from marble trails (the small naked boy, the child (with wings)) who waited for her on the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored secession swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it into her notebook in a blink of an eye - with remarkable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been examined in this way by the architect Meder and present them now in his published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing)": People's Swimmers in Munich, the historical palace of swimming pools in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
In 13 countries, she was led by her "Travel behind the most unusual spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a real enthusiast of floating culture.
With sports, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
It is only against anger that fan swims must be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners for health can inhale the scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," said Vienna-based Mrs. Meder.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Climbing in the jump pool and essential oils for the sauna - the comfort factor is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so many Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be swimming pools for the eyes, saying, "There is a man in the pools of water instead of the floor."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically doubling: high vault, large tiles, jumpboards.
The "Badefreden" Malformatic Image Association provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but especially the desire to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by Mrs. Meder's swimmer in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spas, like the 100-year-old Shechenyi spa in Budapest, she found water with nitrogen content in the original beautiful cave (the Cave Spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a building shaped like a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jaszberen).
On the other hand, many heated swimming pools under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful view. As long as a person has a swimming pool in the city's Curysh Mountains, he can view the snow covered in Arlberg - and: In steam baths there is a window from which you can watch the movement on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Lägenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three tops of open pans in winter, steam rises while in the background of Mount Ötztal it goes to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not every swimming pool collector in the town of Meder was able to climb the scent of chlorine into the flu.
Many thermal baths are smelling of cheese, in the spas of Arpad in Bekesab, Hungary, it smells of warm oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he has reached the spas.
The smell comes from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits are pumped into the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she ran into a closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the decaying windows of the red and white-yellow secession building, she saw how the weeds between the tiles were growing.
In contrast, they stood up in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: at the Palace Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three phases of construction; man can discover not only the novel elements that originate from their creation in 1844, but also the Maura Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite spa site of Mrs Iris Meder's pool acquaintance, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It is already some kind of performance, to connect such diverse construction structures into such a beautiful complex," said Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, diving into a thermal pool seems to be a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets us check the commodity business
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave his trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned the task force to investigate the consequences of speculation on the poor.
Then, in January, the head of the company wants to take the consequences out of it.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the community, it is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable to have banks speculate on agricultural raw materials as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of those questioned even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to withdraw from this business because it deepens the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of the Forsa survey from the mandate of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
It shows author Harald Schumann that the stakes on global commodity exchanges drive prices to highs and banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The Consumer Protection Campaign is aimed specifically at Chef Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were meant to secure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants have opted out of supply and demand in the interest of high risk trades - and at the expense of the poorest they have achieved profits.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that the exclamation points would be verified and said that no trade "is worth noting that the good reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake".
SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group of foodwatch-Report extracts, according to information.
The check is due to be closed by the end of the year, and the results will then be presented to Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to load it.
In the end of January, the bank's representatives want to tell us what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even total rejection.
Ackermann is working with his own help on his image.
Foodwatch Thila Bode's head welcomed the report, but also reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastic how the bank today is damaging to the general good."
Let Ackermann be the highest banking lobbyist in the world.
"Deutsche Bank must delete from its portfolio all items in which money is used for betting on food prices," stated Bode.
"Wonderful whether Mr. Ackermann is suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first sight to be surprising, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture several months before leaving the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the board of directors other than planned.
By turning away from disputed agricultural speculation, it could improve its image.
And possible losses need not be taken care of - he should eventually deal with his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would have confessed
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
Already more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which 1001 people were interviewed on 7 and 8 November.
It is precisely 11 percent that Deutsche Bank considers it legitimate to offer investments with which bets on food prices are linked.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would, as a result of the survey, confess all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would warn those known to such a bank, 49 percent said that they would consider canceling their account and move on to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
History of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and released.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it burns for modern postwar architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold sweeps and new building materials, which are typical of belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a prestigious and celebrated example.
Schwanzer's pavilion then received Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and impressive steel and glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone of the current architecture.
He celebrated the architect by building a pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW palace plus key built in Munich, it was finally internationally celebrated in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the designed pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the 20th century Museum – it was named "House of the 20th Century".
But for the museum the building was neither spatial nor technical - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no air conditioning.
Nevertheless, it was used until the current art awaited a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been searching more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion has reconstructed, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
A new start was introduced to Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a renowned art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. in her youth, a wrestler, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, imposed a major reconstruction in politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz should be exhibited by the same name foundation, a cafe and bookstore should be created, and an office building must be built to do so.
Close surveillance, low budget.
To perform, Krischanitz was then the ideal fit.
Not only did he emotionally reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's secession buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University Vienna and the pavilion was "an immeasurably important place" for him, where he "almost every weekend" looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and ease in moving to Vienna and changing its use.
During the current reconstruction there were far bigger problems: the building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used with glass fibres reinforced by insulation glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel carriers were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were repaired.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a busy lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leading to the entrance of the bridge - almost a new building, but still a magnificent Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door was preserved, the building was carved in an old anti-corrosion reddish tone.
And the kinosal is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial office and the low budget.
"Frequently there must have been a material that is good and cheap and also liked by the memorial office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, the typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
This architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet it wants to "be properly confident".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as there has been an urban happy coincidence: In the circle around Schweizer Garten there is a completely new design "Local Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there will be another happy chance: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they are heard, is already dealing with the city's neighbourhood in Schweizer Garten.
The track plans a million-dollar winter crisis package
The road has unleashed a crisis plan to prevent the collapse of trains during the winter season.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter resulting from train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than €70 million this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report with a reference to the internal corporate plan, which is said to account for a total of EUR 300 million in investments by 2015.
It is said to achieve better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external workers per 16,000 to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to remove the platform for the start of operation and 90 per cent for the operation of the necessary leakages within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives about train failures and delays during this winter.
During the last winter period, the road in passenger transport had significant problems because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, there was a shortage of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delays in the deployment of ICE trains are involved.
The road does not have to be controlled more often after the summer, when there was an ICE train at the main station of Köln to destroy the repairs.
Deutsche Bank pays a million fine in the USA
After a start around Chief Josef Ackermann there are new trampolines in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages.
As if Deutsche Bank didn't have enough problems at home, she caught up with his past in the US: the Frankfurt institution is paying 145 million euros in one balancing procedure ($106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's a mortgage sale.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator is counting on a number of large banks to reduce risks by making false promises to buy financial products.
In the course of the crisis, such papers lost considerable value and brought banks to ruin.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to bring the parties to court," said the spokesman, Deutsche Bank, in New York.
The bank doesn't accept any guilt by making amends.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the attendance of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is suitable for cooperative banks in the USA and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billions of damages incurred.
Now the ending of the settlement is the first of its kind.
The regulator also relied on other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
For questionable mortgages it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became a lot of financial firms fateful.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though events occurred a few years ago, the banks are now blowing a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to obtain corrections or to raise doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It refers to 18 international banks that two U.S. government financiers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's real estate in mortgage transactions amounted to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face FHFA lawsuits, this is more than a total of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority shall require the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM IT.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, an important American investor, Warren Buffett, has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term development of companies is only to be expected with difficulty.
However, he now read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM offers services primarily and provides computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered to be a knight's match.
As a result, it is possible to call it motherly mining IT IBM now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett announced at the U.S. CNBC economic radio station that he had purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of the largest IBM shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement yet.
He praised the management, who tried for economic crisis even for proper returns.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centres.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting and powerful computers for companies.
Buffett's been avoiding tech companies until today.
He claims to invest only in enterprises whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett hit the freight line, after the lubricant manufacturer or after the machines.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns about 80 owned subsidiaries in a number of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old master took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built it with wise investments one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
For many investors around the world, therefore, he is a cult figure.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
When Buffet’s investment became known, IBM’s shares increased by one percent before the stock exchange began.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered together with Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable technological enterprises.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to perform.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the "Bunks in Zwicka", Turkish media doubt the German state of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now alive again.
The murders of eight small businesses of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, this report was addressed with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back the horror that has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
There was no doubt about it in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a range whose dimensions cannot be monitored for a long time.
"Is he alive again with bloody ideology?" headlines from the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police agent of the Department of Protection and fear that the German authorities might also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted with discretion: It recalled the weekend by a demonstration of silence in front of the Brandebur gate of victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a field, several Turkish media reports: "Germany's Gift to the Fifty" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the killing series.
The issue of the "Hürriyet" for Germany also cannot be taken in order not to carry out this thought link.
"It's starting to smell," sounds a column title from Ahmet Külagci.
It emphasises that people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The police procedure and its late success in the search are most critically discussed in the German Internet Forums.
Why did the German authorities not think much sooner that suspects should be found in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are presented as being rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If action continues to be carried out so superficially, there will be nothing for immigrants other than their own defence and weapons".
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selene".
Which means, if internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen incinerator is deep embedded in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown here the living Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that distrust and retreat can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations made the Turks more aware of each other.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press was particularly critical of the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After a burning attack in Solingen, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish president of state, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech at a sad celebration in Köln.
It's as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how profound the distrust of many German Turks in the local state administration is.
In addition to efforts to explain extensively and re-evaluate right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
A scandalous bank near the Lake Curysh
The most expensive bank of Europe has no registered office in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered from the financial crisis almost bankrupt and since then a slide from one crisis to another.
Now it's some German to compare it.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the head of the Federal Bank, he was known in July to enter almost as spectacular a new job: the President of the Governing Board of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turn."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But by September, it was clear that everything would turn out completely different.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and lost about €1.7 billion.
Head of UBS Oswald Grübel, a recognised banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Management Board has also been dressed since then - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber Bank has been able to advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Governing Council will take over already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, rather an economics professor and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
Suddenly, he will take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has proved once again that he deserves the title "Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
However, UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and it has been moving from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing seems to be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started for the financial crisis.
Until 2007, she had an excellent reputation for UBS.
The image of a silent and solid but also clever asset manager combines with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS managed 2007 on one side with $1.6 billion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank to the league of the world's biggest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich Hans Geiger relates: "I always described UBS as a model of a good bank to my students back then."
"From today's perspective, one asks, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something in the UBS had gone wrong properly.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who was considered to be a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To keep it steady, UBS will raise its capital to indeed 13 billion francs.
Indeed, she found investors, such as the one she had recently covered with her nose: the Intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first time.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to admit new billions of losses, the President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
The disaster followed in October 2008: UBS stood on account of its misinvestment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for compulsory convertible bonds for which it could become a joint owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks in its territory.
After all, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times more than the performance of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We can't save UBS one more time," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster follows the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitalised in a tax dispute with America and has shown its willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible, have cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on undue profits from these stores, including a fine.
This proved more or less open to UBS by helping to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it was.
Following the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central areas of business over several months: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in the management of assets to help reduce tax.
And just when it calmed down a little bit, just when UBS thought it had recovered again, there's this unfortunate business base: the only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it's obviously still not working.
"The case of Adoola has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finance Professor of Finance at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not manage risk control."
But it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had stepped forward long ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: no too great a risk, but security for money - also on this side the Alpine Republic collapsed the world again.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially high-quality chocolate.
The UBS centre in Zurich is still suitable for the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it is only slightly larger.
It's already a classic position.
The Bank has its main headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Lake Curyša, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, and the rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's will be among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been established here: from Nationalbank through Palas der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall UBS has a heavy turning door.
Inside they are walled with marble, in front of them are powerful leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large direction towards the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank was suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank found.
His name would rather not read in the papers, eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, with both big banks too.
UBS may have grown too large, finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglosas expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have much more to say.
"And if they do, they've adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it first high profits and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small 7 million countries came to a major rescue event in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Dere UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save a large bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks joined a powerful group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it kept growing.
In addition, both different UBS banking predecessors were complemented by: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with the difficulty of managing assets and poorer but internationally more involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in handy for a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, Head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Management Board, from 2001 to 2007.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages feelings around the stomach that has evolved from banking science completely up."
But Ospel said he was relying on Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli probably made some crucial mistakes in the end: "I think he thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, I guess.
Of course, pride preceded a fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the heads of staff's holdings, on which the company chief Wuffli repeated the same password over and over again: crash Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She listed "League Tables", a ranking that documented the success of the banks at the time.
In it she tried to place UBS completely upstairs.
She's already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade she participated in the game completely upstairs.
However, the business advisors who have been entrusted point out one weakness: In the international interest shop, in the speech of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to pursue an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungers after growth have invested both the bank itself and its established fund to ensure the risk of US investment in Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that converted securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - but also left risks to itself.
Also when the other banks were looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, there UBS was buying," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager had to go after the other when trying to clean up was more difficult than it was supposed to be.
The UBS positions have become a catapulting seat and are moving to today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has almost insurmountable work.
He must find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: Stop with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment banking industry is going to be severely destroyed, so clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti's new bank boss wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only understood as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the previous Grübel.
In the meantime, he settled down: To run the UBS business for a long time, Curyšska banka reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats are cut out.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But the only thing he's saying so far is that he'll find his wife in Zurich's apartment first.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs heavily on the stock market in the United States.

Europe may not recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in one CNBC-interview that it would not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
That is why it is perhaps too early in his view to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, he left Buffett a few decades old principle and entered the American technological industry.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, ravens of the field are regarded as "problem birds": however, these highly intelligent animals cannot be expelled from the cities long ago, according to experts.
Some like them, others like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the city’s image for centuries, yet in some municipalities complaints of pollution and noise caused by animals are gathering.
But it's not against "problem birds" yet in sight.
The ravens of the field can no longer be driven out of the cities, said experts at the first symposium on crows in East Africa's Leer.
That's where experts from all over the county have consulted on possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The conservationists also derived from the exodus of specially protected meadows of the field: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about to destroy the traditional area of life.
Persecution, growing construction, and cutting down typical birds’ nesting trees make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, among other things, in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Brem and in Leer.
There the 2005 controversial project of mass killing crows in the rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics have marked the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal exile, fear, nothing," that's how much the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer found.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has side effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Badensk-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies splinter and divide into different places."
Fear is only thought of as an exception to hospitals, homes of pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory the problem of cities could not be solved, was the opinion of the mayor of Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and inviting them to settle in other places is thoughtable.
"The information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of the entirely different treatment of animals: "One sin in the face can finally end with confidence."
Ms Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg science path, on which they provide information boards on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been accepted by tourists in the meantime.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is every volume of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skills of animals are legendary: The ravens of the field do not use only aid to reach the pamls, but even as a tool they will prepare.
Researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested the behavior of four ravens in the field as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must lead to a collapsed structure in order to reach the larvae of the pier.
Without much training they knew what size and shape the stone must have to have to cause the platform collapse.
In the second attempt, the anointed crows had to solve a more insidious problem.
In a vertically built war, researchers placed a small vessel with a larvae of molasses.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with a toothpick.
But the researchers put a piece of wire in there.
Of them, she formed all four animal hooks, which, as a prey, used to hunt the vessel from the tube by the handle.
Three of the four ravens in the field even managed to make it with a lock.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosniaks and Turks have not come out.
Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Leaded by the twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8., 53.) Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2.1) and made the fifth match in the first round of the European Championship perfect.
Czechs had enough in retaliation Play-off with outsider Montenegro result 1:0 (0:0) when the first match was a clear thing.
Even Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey did not give the Bran, Ireland reached 1 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Federal League of Misimovic converted by a penalt (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already failed in the playoffs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a peaceful start.
Ronaldo made early lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
About a good quarter of an hour later he showed Nani his quality in shooting at a long distance and adjusted the shot from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who didn't do it in the first half hour, had their first clear shot at Edina Jack's goalie.
Former Wolfsbury player from English at the head of the standing club Manchester City has placed the head ball on the lower edge of the log, but the ball has not crossed the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
He was finally standing in the centre of Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following an action against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the opposite side Stark made a controversial criminal dig after Fabio Coentraa's action, which Misimovic changed with certainty.
But after the break, he explained everything to the 2004 European Deputy Minister with four points.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in 81 minutes.
With this goes the Master of Europe from 1976 to the fifth in line for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilk's men with the legionnaire Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) were also fortunate and had to overcome a terrible second at the beginning.
Brankár Petr Čech prevented reflexively at the last moment the possible own gate of Tomáš Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its biggest chance when Duo Stephen Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in 40 minutes from the edge of the criminal territory only close to the Czech goal.
After the break, the transverse log had to save the place of the already collapsed goalkeeper of the Czech World Class, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Just before the end, Branka finally cleared it up.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that point.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has his place on the third bench in the World Cup 2002 he must relax, he is allowed to enjoy Croatia from his fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before the 31,000 viewers at Maximir Stadium, the Turks should have almost a fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan shot only a rod from a distance in the seventh minute, the assailant Kazim also couldn't refract the ball in the gate.
After this terrible second, Croatia was taking control more and more.
They also did not get a goal after the break of Croatia.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfgang, who released Dortmund Ivan Perisica from 62 minutes ago, there were also legionaries from the Federal League Daniel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni's going to the European Championship
In Dublin the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the success of 4:0 in the first game of the preliminary decision, in 32 minutes to the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) settled for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the beginning, but it had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defense prevented the possible leader of the gate.
But in 32 minutes, it was pretty far away.
After the unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Paul Londonka was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to state 1:0.

Massacre at Personal Level
An emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund called Beauty and Grief: The Confidential History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of performing characters that your head turns out to be.
One piece of advice on how to behave at that point: Carefully pull this page out and make a note of it.
All persons will be well acquainted with Mr Englund's novel story and this list will serve as a navigation - as a beacon - at times when men and women in the story will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy to the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite conveniently, as "antihistoric work".
It contains several very famous names, important contracts or famous battles, on the other hand, there are almost no ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, rather "the book about what it was like". It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and sorrow" combines war experiences of 20 more less fat men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flash like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the complex of fates while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classical historical novels.
It regulates the idea that World War I was just about the terrible trench fights on the Western Front.
Beauty and Grief also explores other places where war drama took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bees' nests falling on them, must spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids or face the presence of flies tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very impressive reading.
The war will consume people's lives like a natural disaster, like Katrina's hurricane smelling of gunpowder.
When the shooting starts in the distance and you're the woman who's at home with your kids, will you run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "was filled with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
Beauty and Grief follows individual stories such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from CVs, letters, and other published material.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and seductive, but thanks to the inclusion of tiny moments and details they are completely alive and credible.
Many of them deal with suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Replacements, all over the place substitutes."
"Replacement of coffee, imitation of aluminium, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes the replacements of food in Germany.
It mentions "mass made of pressed rice cooked in skein fat (and supplemented by a fake bone made of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato chips, shoes with wooden soles".
He mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds an inner desire for savagery and brutality, which states about war: "At last you will understand that this is human nature. Never sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbarian in the inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, rather than grieve.
"If a person finally accepts that he is sacrificing, he would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict he hangs secretly".
Other comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive battle," wrote Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he called "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a garment cut to the ground, which he commits his bloodshed without standing up from the table."
People act completely unexpected, meanness changes with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid the service on the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was dealing with gonokok manure, which the soldiers were buying and denying their genitalia in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones have put it in their eyes, which has often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation, from Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is fresh, but it has not proved to be, which is an excellent fit for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war "extremely insurmountable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the first world war were mostly more than comprehensive stories worked with clues, such as "First World War and modern memories" from Paul Fusselle or novels such as "On the Western Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers the unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating ending, which in popular scientific literature has no parallels.
But I'm not going to tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from the list of heroes out of his hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time per minute exactly scheduled case
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some in helmets used in street riots.
Monday night was elected because the Zuccotti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told it was a drill.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases from the last few weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, should not have been repeated, thereby violating the rules of the department, and the wave of sympathy from the public has shifted to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, police operations aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from demonstrators were initiated after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by the operations carried out in other cities.
Massive behavioural exercises in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was preparing for the event in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders strengthened the so-called restorative training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" was announced by someone who was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and no one has said that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that they remain anonymous.
"The fact that he was going to Zuccotti Park was known only to the highest rank of members of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had once received.
On October 14th, the representatives of the city were to clean up the park plan, but then they withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they were enrolled before the operation started in the park for hundreds.
Tuesday's events were attended by officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people come and go to the park, so one hour a night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge Bridge Bridge Bridge, freight vehicles of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The light and recorded report from the amplioners frightened many demonstrators.
When members of order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
The police claim that by 1:45 a.m., they had not touched the only tent that would give the demonstrators time to pack their things.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park so that they could infiltrate it if any arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police chief Paul J. Browne claimed it was for their own safety.
Many journalists, however, feel that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and some policemen treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown claimed that television cars on Church Street along the western border of the park could have filmed without a hitch.
The police followed in the west direction and became entangled in the heavy confusion of the protestor's personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department who immediately collected everything left in the park.
Some protestors who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documentary images appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most notorious group of demonstrators fled to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the middle of the park.
Some set up a roadblock and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were attached to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut through the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m., no arrests took place in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Brown said there were about 142 people being held in the park.
Most of the arrests took place due to "organising riots and resisting arrest," he explained.
The highest police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in managing the operation," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, there were roadblocks.
From these places the police then developed a seat belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people further across the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, a protestor was seen south of Pine Street, jumping out onto the hood of a police car, and several others, venting air from the tires of a police van.
At one point a piece of rink came out of the crowd.
One officer and one protestor were hospitalized at the end of the operation.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for release
The departments representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissal was not necessary, and in addition it was discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The court is likely to be the last option that remains for the unions in District Council 37 in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decision.
On 7 October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst-paid employees of the city, described their dismissals as paying off the city for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by the labour force, through which the city wanted to put a hole in the budget.
The city's representatives have categorically rejected this accusation.
At last month's City Council meeting, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said that the release was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Board immediately countered the fact that the budget did not specifically mention the release of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. They are calling a press conference on Wednesday, where they will formally file a complaint with the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the defendant will be a party to eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Spanish, as will most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and that is why he will not make any accusations.
According to the proposal for a complaint that the New York Times had succeeded in obtaining, the unions focused on the number of people released in the poor parts of the city, which sought to support their allegations of unfair conduct, because they felt that the poor schools had lost more assistants because they had been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island did not release themselves at all and in the Upper East Side part only at least, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, the work of 17 school assistants was lost, and in the districts of District 8 and 9 in South Bronx, as many as 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. In the lawsuit it is said: "It is not a neighborhood full of talkative parents who can provide funding to settle the deficit in the budget."
The Public School 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus finances for every registered poor student.
In addition, the committees argue that the directors of secondary schools may have been confused by the way in which a document authorising the release of parental coordinators was written.
The word "excess" was used in the description of the event, so cancel the position, although the word is often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were released," the complaint said, "and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to make a deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed. For a long time, the ruling dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops had to be terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on the statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I Lieberman (Conn) in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and American troops for their "stability".
"With this statement we want to appreciate the courage of the Libyan people who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
Those sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has been easy so far.
During the summer, legislators from both sides constantly argued with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of declarations of approval or on the contrary the refusal of the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in Parliament because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that the motion was rejected in Parliament, the Chamber rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
Thus, the American mission in Libya literally found itself in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama managed the mission, but its members obviously did not resent it enough to stop supporting him in his work.
The seriousness of the convention was finally preceded by further events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and on October 20th, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations, in its statement, "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity, which they have used to liberate their people" and "glorifies the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have participated in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The declaration also "confirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be redistributed into two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
Against the latest version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), chief representative of the Republican Party on the Commission, stood up.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
Parliament will vote this week on an addendum to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, implemented by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution on a budget or other subject on which the whole House or Senate will vote.
Other legislators have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals to the vote.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 additions to the constitution that were presented at the congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are only minor exchanges of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balance sheet supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their advocates - especially the beginning republicans, who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required that the Parliament and the Senate vote on the balance-of-budget allowance.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of an independent declaration in support of the creation of such an allowance.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limits on the number of periods during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that the President may hold.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains the addition prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and the addition prohibiting the burning of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws in case two thirds of the countries face them.
Although members of the Congress appear to be very active in proposing various supplements, they do not deviate significantly from the average compared to previous years.
At 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while at 100 the Congress there were 66.
Their activity even fades from the early 1990s, when according to statistics of the Senate library members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politics.
The last supplement, which was added - the 27th Appendix - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Blowed but not defeated," says Gifford in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, she sang along with a song from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that more than a return to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" at ABC News Station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of sentences still made her trouble and needed help while walking.
The whole show documented her difficult reconstruction, which was necessary for the damage caused by a bullet that penetrated her skull in the front, penetrated her left brain and left her out of the back of her head.
Three months ago, she unexpectedly returned to Parliament to triumphantly vote on the debt ceiling.
During her first TV interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, the 14-year-old Giffords replied, "That's pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special "20/20" program that was broadcast the night before the release of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabby: Story of Courage and Hope".
The Special has been watching Gifford's entire reconstruction since the 8th of January shooting.
On the videos that Kelly made during the first week, you can see Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can't do more at the time than just pick up one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapists are teaching her how to do simple activities.
Nod your head.
It's lip-punching.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that the main role for Giffords' recovery was music: Congresswoman sings them along with a therapist on the tune to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cindi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer said that she didn't remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said that the Giffords had read the news articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who was the six who was killed in the incident.
From the shooting is suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of violent drugs he is awaiting trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Abominable, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said during the reconstruction, "I lost."
"So I immediately said to her, "Gabby, you didn't lose," said Kelly.
"You just got a kick out of it.
But you can do it, you can pull yourself together, and you'll come back even stronger than ever."
Military units meet more with compassion than with respect
The event was a gala night on Wall Street that brought out millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have been around him.
The festively dressed crowd rose up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The party evening was attended by the then chairman of the Staff Chiefs' Committee. In addition to him was Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces somewhat differently.
"All were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
So completely different impressions only illustrate the easy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is boundlessly praised for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like they're feeling sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"Only it seems that the only way some can support us is to make us the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or ruin their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops had to face back from Vietnam had been much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are expressed in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from fighting events where they served as Marines, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at them from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and wonder because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will drill their heads if "there is no evil, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took up office in Washington in the government after returning.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him inconceivably suggested that he could resist the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning from combat.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," the Cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the army partly stems from the American indifference to war.
The success of the battlefield is only a few moments away from gaining recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and that has little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation we no longer respect military heroism as was the case in World War II," declared Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are credited for the number of events they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to take a firm action against rape
This week, it will decide whether the trial of 28 women and men against the military will be initiated due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, they are prepared to file a complaint with hundreds of other applicants.
First class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was the night she was allegedly raped by a fellow army officer, 25 years old, and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her so they could have a drink in her room.
"I had a warning light in my head," Lyman explained.
But the native Texas had completely ignored her objections.
I thought to myself, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, her husband crossed over, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, however, Washington’s lawyer Susan Burke was indicted and the prosecution had 17 members. During the following months, however, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed in investigating, punishing and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says he's going after the highest-ranking military commanders, because the problem begins with them.
"Armada is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the imposition of measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February, she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could have become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than collect all charges in this case - she laid all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she will file lawsuits in several different cases if it is necessary for the pressure not to collide.
The defence team is headed by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The documents obtained by Newsweek discuss in detail the defence strategy - in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot sue an army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military service of the defendants," the document reads.
The Ministry of Defence refused to make a statement on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950 ’ s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in battle, it is only a matter of speaking: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers played an increasingly significant role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
The time has come to modernise even in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit at the four main military academy for alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
In spite of this, the nonprofit organisation of American Vietnamese veterans collects the grounds for their action against the army. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personal disorders", which was allegedly found in rape victims to have an excuse for their release - according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati, who belong to the human rights group Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
In December, her group had already filed a motion for a complaint against a state organisation for dealing with veterans, accused of discriminatory practices that were to take place in the processing of requests for assistance by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains undeclared in most cases and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year in question.
In a report issued in March, the rate of prosecution of suspects was also taken down: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the military were brought to trial - half of them compared to the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks as the first of a series of traumas.
First class soldier Lyman, for example, reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to eleven different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She took all the tests necessary to determine the rape and found the attacker's blood in her bed - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman held a court hearing during which she was asked questions as to whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six individuals were summoned to testify in favor of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was giving birth right there - screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his judgment.
The Lymans ordered a military psychiatrist to visit her, who eventually diagnosed her personality disorder, thus calling her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to benefit.
Whether Lyman's case and other prosecutors move to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to further stages of the discussion."
But between them and the verdict, there is a doctrine that has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of the world.
I'm a life-long critic of Doctor Feres Doctrine myself.
The army is a few decades behind, because their responsibilities do not make it possible to maintain the same degree of motivation and deterrent.
He adds, "The odds are hard on them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoy, the lawyer of the defendants, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a complaint and will start working on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes before.
The walls have eyes: As scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them isn't really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, author of a recent British research team report on European digital populism.
The supply of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply use advertising on the site, and because of this they have determined with absolute precision the desired demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, and they focused on them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of inviting them to a newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they called on them to fill out a questionnaire that asked questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online followers of right-wing groups are entirely young men, who are frightening the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain permanently hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding in updates, contributions to the walls and pressed buttons "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide on average three different data each day, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in which the name Facebook appears has increased compared to the state of affairs nearly 800% five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be hard to identify them when you wanted to do research among people from the British National Party."
"You'd have to get to a side where they'd never let you go," Bartlett says.
"This is all Facebook breaking down -- you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who had been studying their drinking performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that peers of the students of the site monitor and come with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morena and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify endangered children who otherwise we wouldn't have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team developed statistics on the relationship between the relative status and the day of St. Valentine, the election participation in 2010 and the contention of the nation (mainly using information that they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. However, online data are accessible to everyone.
"In my opinion, most users did not think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about the 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it so that the information was only between them and their friends."
It is then also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even in research off-line there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that pencils and notebooks remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go to the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the establishment of two attacks during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a fighter of the "defense" during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," 500 people said in court.
"I object to the court because the mandate has been given to you by an organization supporting the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not plead guilty to them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could report his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announced that the competent authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives and survivors attended the hearing.
Some have come to hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he is held firmly under lockup.
They all took part to move the case to an early conclusion.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," the NRK commentator said to one of the survivors of the attack.
"There was nothing pleasant about it, but I can tell for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved on again."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When he arrived and went into the building without difficulty by looking the journalists present and the survivors into the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger resistance movement, the judge stated that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
For someone, it may be comforting to know that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but she didn't," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If I did, it would be a lot easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie going to movies this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, people came to think of him as Henry Ford, and they chose him as his genius, the greatest modern inventor.
In the recent interview with Jobs, which was interviewed for a special film that goes to the movies this week, it will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind fully understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who fits every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent result is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting took place a unique, more than hourly interview.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new NeXT computer company, and he was eager to see how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used on TV and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost during the transport.
Shortly after Job's death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly cut, forms the basis of a 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: The lost interview that goes to the selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has proclaimed his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection when you see how Jobs is thinking perfectly about being as prestigious and as precise as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism surfaces, where Cringely’s questions are impatient and stimulate him to get to the more important problems and topics quickly.
The interview was recorded before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, and there are frighteningly prophetic thoughts in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job's posthumous career evaluation, but on Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of what things might and should look like.
It didn't take long, and after he said his thoughts, he also started putting them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes of the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"During years of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same, "Well, this is just how you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify Apple's accounts.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often started with the words "standard costs", about their amount he could only guess. At that point he decided to go his own way - developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs in a moment.
How did he do the pope's barbecue?
Jobs remembers the Blue Box he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively break into the phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
A number of articles have been written about the device in the past, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an instrument of power, is literally contagious.
They're telling us how they tested the device with a paid phone, and during the call, they were able to connect from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we've gone around the world like this, so when we screamed something on the paid phone, it came back a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we learned that we could build ourselves a thing capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
We made ourselves a little thing that was able to control a much bigger one - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been destroyed without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke that they almost reached the end with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, claiming to be Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called on to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the pope himself was raised up, the couple were moved and hung up.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a land surveyor, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what it was, and how it was supposed to treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited a company research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager, I progressed higher and higher in HP, hung around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How does innovation come about:
In several places Jobs talks about how they come up with new running products.
At the beginning of his career, when he went out to sell a few boards with flat connections, a customer asked him to build a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which he had to invent, install and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was in Apple later, he remembers the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we had a pretty wild fight... "we shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
Long before leading up to Apple's resurrection, Jobs made a clear prediction that many industrial leaders in their vision would sway and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, there's disposal and marketing, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that society has led to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could be ten times bigger than she is, she could be Microsoft in the '90s...
But instead of winning, they made a loss.
How does innovation take the form of art:
"There is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and as this great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to make a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories you don't force.
You have to remember 5,000 things all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
After all, it depends on the taste -- you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some ways you try to project them into what you're doing yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed that I stole the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and coincidental experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in entirely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time of their trial
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether it would accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by a law firm that would participate in the proceedings before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit brought by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of health care, which Congress approved last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the suit, but in March, a 5.5-hour hearing is expected, the result of which is further enhanced by the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the law rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush's rule.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, has been one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been engaged in defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that question the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel hours after a court discussion on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the supreme representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act, participated.
And what about the guests?
This is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And it's definitely not about anything that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to abide by the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if that were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which states that "a judge may take part in events that are directly related and other organisations holding for the purpose of obtaining funds, but a judge may not be a spokesman, an honest guest, nor may he be included in the programme of action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with the two law firms active in the case, as well as companies of great financial interest in this case, was largely enough to alert ethical activists in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the statement by several judges that the highest court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause organization.
"The judges drank and ate at the social benefit together with the legal representatives waiting to discuss their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines their feet with any claim of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding to their critics and told them that they also had no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginny is a highly-built conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly that of Judge Elena Kagan and not of Scalia with Thomas.
Kaganová worked as Attorney General for President Obama's government when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
Critics of Kagan pressure her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought for the law at that time rather than to be unbiased.
Kagan didn't suggest she was going to step down.
Boeing received a record contract for jet aircraft worth $18 billion
The Emirates airlines order 50 two-way jet planes Boeing 777 with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aeroplanes to Aman Air, for which it incurs more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is a manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aeroplanes totals a record US$ 18 billion, it is something else.
Also important news is where Boeing obtained the contract: Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 double street stream Boeing 777.
The sensational order came from the Emirates Airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, making the total value of the contract rise to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which are proud of significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total price of these six aeroplanes exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many of the airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil - mining nations there.
This means that they have not only money to pay aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its greatest costs - is not so decisive because the country itself earns oil at higher prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from the Emirates airlines strengthens Boeing’s leading position on the broadband market and leads to a narrow SAS Airbus company that tried to undermine Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’s representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER, would be removed.
This was due to the fact that customers required more useful loads and landings, so the manufacturer took the time to provide the machine with greater engine power.
The price of Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister was reportedly defeated in the Michigan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was aided by drug traffickers chasing the governor's chair.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon lost her position as governor in Michoacán in a violent state election, and then announced on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were awarded by the leadership in the Western governorate election to Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of members of organised crime throughout the electoral process and especially until yesterday's election itself is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country as a whole," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview for the radio day after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion polling group... seized election urns, built roadblocks... and let people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when it lost the Presidency.
However, the early return to power and victory in the Michoacán elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to accept Valleona as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left hand side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has so far ruled the governor's office. For the controversial and unfortunate party pursued, a very unfortunate loss is ahead of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in December 2006 that the military struggle against traffickers began.
However, violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the elections and many candidates for the election for fear resigned.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán may look like to the PRI side, the victory of the party will help to gain new momentum.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Valley and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Bank of Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the euro area from its serious debt crisis, otherwise the global economy could have a overall decline, which would have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the Bric Group states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are monitoring all European difficulties "too undisturbed" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and means, would help fuel the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe from the crisis is welcome," the Financial Times told the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asie may be protected to some extent, but she is definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
For several months now, the European Monetary Association has been having a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have stepped down.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could pull back into recession, and a call has begun to emerge to bring the emerging leading economies together and to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of European Union financial assistance bonds, the institution for European financial stability - would provide more negotiating opportunities for the Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and must maintain a high growth rate."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indian economy, have nothing to do with helping European economies when forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to explain aid to Europe to 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they could find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatened with a "hazardous dominant effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011/2012, 7.5% of economic growth will take place in Asia is now facing a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets must create "unforeseeable spending plans" to protect them from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible defensive cuts
On Monday in Congress, the Minister of Defence Leon Pantt firmly attached under the boiler when he warned that drawing automatic cuts in the budget could endanger national security and create a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the Afghanistan battlefield to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next ten years, but it is now afraid to cut another $600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," wrote Panette in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach a budget agreement, resulting in the so-called restoration, would cause 23% flat-rate decline and stop many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of a building or ship. In addition, there could be serious damage to other modernisation efforts," wrote Pantta to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is going to take place so quickly, we will also have to send civilians on forced leave almost certainly to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with faith those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the scaffolds will also touch the combat forces, Pantto announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations in the sea will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Pantto warned.
"There will be cuts in the contract staff as well, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting our people's war effort."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both senators wrote down Pantat ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of the establishment at the Ministry of Defence could result in a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not the conclusion we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Panett's letter and the fresh warning will increase the pressure on the Congress approving the budget and will increase the voices calling for the Pentagon to be excluded from the list of downtrodden areas.
Pantata has recently been increasingly open in talks about possible cuts, although he himself has moved to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute ago, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort could expect - an army shell, but within which the core would be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a militia without ammunition."
"It'll be like aviation without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"She will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In the annex to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "expressive operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of landings and deployment worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations".
In addition, Pantata added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, even those in the early stages of planning.
For example, there was a project of F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, to which the army and naval infantry wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of F35 would save 80 billion USD over the next ten years, but its supporters argue that it is a necessary further step in improving the army that is needed to address possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A summer view of recent newspaper headlines shows how serious and pervasive lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with charges of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim to be lying to the other.
The administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught up with a microphone that was launched calling US President Barrac Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and to shut up to the stability of many countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately disproved by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using his campaign's finances to try to conceal his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that broke down around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinska.
It's all about cheating at school and at the university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their opinions.
Mentors who should teach the opposite report that lying and cheating is acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show that in one day you're lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting in life.
Determining lies, or "recognition of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Charade, when a person shouts: "I have you." Recognizing deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths of lies have been disproved.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're shivering, cocktailing, blushing or getting their hair cut.
However, do not assume that it is difficult to detect and expose a liar.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the eternal structure, small expressions in the face, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from the vast and growing sector of the recognition of lies and it is clear that exposing deception is a modern skill that can easily be learned and can help you very much in today's complex world - especially if your work responsibilities include hiring, organizing interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be careful, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "targeted" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than to free people (but lies they say are usually "disgusting").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called initial observation.
He'll have a later finding to compare.
Notice holding the body of the subject, his laughter, working with the voice.
You should know if someone is constantly patting his feet so that they do not unjustly accuse him of lying simply because he begins to pat his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the convulsions of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their fictional story, they can turn the tops of the shoes towards the door, bend towards the exit, significantly change the holding of the body or reveal "relief after the conversation" - excessive relief and a change of position when there is a difficult confession behind them.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what relief will look like after it is over.
Also perceive the language of the subject.
It's a famous story about how Scott Peterson once broke up and used past time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a nationwide search for her body.
Deceived individuals may also express themselves with reasonableness: "I had no sexual relations with this lady... Miss Lewinska" or the difficult question will be repeated.
The most common verbal characters are only very insignificant.
Someone can use a lot of "mild language" to answer the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... from my best mind."
In such a response, we will not know too much and often there is another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal any lie, but it is possible to acquire skills that can help us find the lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not running into a liar and a fraud in his personal and work life.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of postponement of approval by the US government has emerged
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus creating trade unions against each other, but calming environmentalists - the company in charge announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could move again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned route of the pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the government of Nebraska.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved even though it will lead to another route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was delaying the decision on a federal permit for the project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that would not be possible to intervene in the Sandhills area in Nebraska and in the Ogalla aquifer, a large underground water supply plant.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably remove any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to see any policy role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the foreign ministry and expressed his support to him.
1,700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Albert to the refinery in Texas, it passes 700,000 barrels of oil daily.
Six countries will have to be crossed this way.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the labour force, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the aquifer Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the ministry's inspector general had ordered a new review of the whole process of the original study and focused mainly on two issues.
It was once whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the programme.
Next, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not selected inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of puking fear because of her
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously invaded the vestibule of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter by making her vomit out of it.
The performance of the singer of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family claims in a lawsuit brought before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk delivered the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the vestibule of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up."
LaBell gave the pregnant woman an irritable reprimand.
"In an aggressive tone she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you think."
She got angry and started talking dirty - she screamed loudly at the meanest expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started pulling water out of me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter."
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, told Rosanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she vomited, she delivered.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBell, but no answers were received.
The lawyer and the singers of LaBelle do not respond to our calls to express themselves to the entire cause.
The lawsuit requires closer-to-acquisition compensation, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to devote all the money spent to a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The goal is to get Patti Labelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child."
The climate has slowed down the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and reliability grew in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined and the economy also decreased.
The year 2011 will be in Sinaloa's economic history. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which is itself called the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations regarding economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have declined.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the growth potential of the state economy, and are consciously reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year.
According to the report on damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded at 582,835 hectares of farmed land, 78,03% of which was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially damaged.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geographicality, the unemployment rate in the country increased steadily during the first three quarters of the year. Between January and March, 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, representing a unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to increase to 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation approved by Congress in relation to the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally support dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them," he stressed.
Stop Migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad, to the United States, has decreased, and this is due to the difficult entry and then because even though these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand a job from our state, and so unemployment increases," he said.
Irreliability
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa also deteriorates due to the increasing reliability prevailing in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the country works without taking social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and reliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from all over the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5 352 pesetas by September, deep below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment over the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment amounted to $630,697 between January and June, which represents a 87.74% decrease compared to $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State states an investment of 17,280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. No debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, Maria López Valdése's first year of government pointed to the lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that there was a lack of harmonisation of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really insignificant during this year. We must work hard to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we must double our efforts, there was no harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said that events such as colds at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not remember fast enough to re-establish the dynamics that would enable us to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we found ourselves deeply under the expected forecasts," he said.
Re-defining the mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employment Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be drawn up to redefine the goals and economic orientation of the state, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources Sinaloa has," he said.
The Work That Is Before Us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better govern the government's efforts.
"I would generally say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted of 8 kg marijuana
The resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a crime of endangering health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by members of the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 on a visit to Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove in a truck of pick up white color. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and on the passenger seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Effects of Crimes.
Debts of project contributions
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Saving public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be reached to the end or that they will be greatly delayed due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if construction work has so far gone forward, it is now threatening that the state government will not be able to provide the necessary supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos per three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until then, only the Federation and the city have provided funds for the work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They have almost 12 million to provide, and even though the year is coming to an end, we did not get anything. Even though we should have a part in July already," he said. "We started and continued projects very well, but we lack money."
He stated that in the course of the administrations of Jesús Aguilar Padilla last year, the State had failed to meet the relevant supplies and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million that the government had not given them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order for us to get to these programmes this year, we had to get the means to cover what he did not finish," he explained.
In spite of the fact that there is a commitment made by the State representatives concerning the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application was sent to Armand Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were to give us $12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even had a peso yet."
Court approves "end of analogue broadcast" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Parliamentary Chamber against the Presidential Decree, which seeks to speed up the so-called "turn off of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
This resulted in the rejection of the action brought by the Senate, because a qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order for the court to be able to express the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid.
The proposal for a ruling drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which is legally reserved by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cefetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Parliamentary Parliament without entering into a discussion on a proposal which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify himself with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal execution could not be structured by means of general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is subject to a federal enforcement mandate that has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is believed that to postpone change would mean to take away the benefits of digitalisation, which requires a decision on public interest. Digitalisation is not only a technical dimension, but "it also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "require the operation of the whole system in place, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State. It includes a wide range of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to introduce a non-conformial decree, which to some extent interferes with the scope of the Congress's powers, into the area of administrative compliance with laws prepared by the legislative authorities.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "vote after voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 of the 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of adding "vote after vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to the data published by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's election was less than 27 per cent, and this has not yet been counted by 879 of the total 6074 constituencies.
In this connection, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán officially did not confirm his political constitution or his National Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel warned of their publication within a specified time limit in the Official Journal Act, with his objections.
On November 9th, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) settled the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the head of state in constitutional reform "inapplicable and illegal" because he has no right to " neither approve nor to vote".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures, it would be possible for the IEM General Council to carry out a partial and overall census.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the respective field or is not available to the President; or if errors have occurred and there is a clear distortion of the election results.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all polling hours will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place at the beginning of the meeting.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible when it is found, after a proper census, that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate ended in second place. In such a case, the electoral packages for which a partial addition has been made will be excluded.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountain of Zapalinama, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Baccio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a festive ceremony and a suffocating mass.
According to the family, it was the lieutenant colonel's last wish that his ashes be scattered in the mountain of Zapalinama.
After receiving the highest honors, the Baccio Cortése family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located in the Nazi Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., there was a farewell at the Technology Institute in Saltillo, which was organized by his former high school students and members of the team of American football, which Felipe Baccio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was to have his ashes scattered in the Zagalinamemé mountain. This is what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "it was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and entered the airport school Collegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, but he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Dávila, remembers him as a very good man, "the only thing came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán at the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in his life: flying.
They gave him the last goodbye.
Felipe Bacario Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, and I said good-bye to all the honours that came to him to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in study and sport.
Bacario Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter that he was driving fell. There was also a government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillen cousin Bacio Cortése (cremated) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the guidance of Major Jaime Martinez to the area where his family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the vessel Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, the military representatives presented 11 persons who were detained in this area for organised crime offences.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned ship of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery took place at a mile [1.5 km] of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that a cabin with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three feet [3 m] away, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the persons was wearing a sporty shirt with yellow colors and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was a man in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was another person's body dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three persons were probably killed elsewhere because no bullets were found.
Messages from one group of organized crime were found on the chateau fence, as well as a series of bullet marks, both on the stand and on the door.
11 suspects were detained in Cadereyt
The Secretary of the National Defence presented 11 persons, including youth, who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the Cadereyta area and which are linked to kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the published information, 8 persons were detained in the Los Alveros colony at the first attempt on 11 November and were able to free one detained person.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured, and they confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6 a.m., the military personnel were on a tour of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when they noticed cars without SPEs and two people.
After stopping the car, they did a search and discovered one rifle, a shell and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the complicits in the La Frauda area was arrested on November 13th. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country above the collapse of the economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the economic disaster and put the entire euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report informing him that Monti, appointed on Sunday, is meeting with President Georgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present the government with a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti announced that he would present to the president the results of his talks, which he had conducted with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis that caused the debt to rise to an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve the hard package of austerity measures required by the European leaders, and it will only be possible to restore Italy's damaged credibility.
Monti is under a great deal of pressure to hurry. Due to the instability of markets, they exceeded interest on the Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity of 7 percent limit, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would very much support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this dire situation.
Monti’s hopes for success increased greatly thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced on Saturday to resign.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, a centre-right party's secret, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because up to this point a number of its members have opposed the government with the technocratic majority of Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort in question could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round of meetings ends Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who made it possible to respond to the crisis very quickly.
After a short decline at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to make a demission, the interest on Italian bonds returned to the critical border and thus reacting to the uncertainty that the new Prime Minister would collect success.
Saving Italy, which has a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the possibilities of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should hold office until the next elections planned for 2013 despite general forecasts that he claims that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include politicians in his office, but large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has experienced due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to integrate into government and political personality.
Spanish take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish football players, 10 will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players invited reached the number 50 match.
Huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ratings, have a wide range of class A inter-election matches in their score, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman's defender, who has played 50 international matches as the only one.
This number reached last Friday in the fight against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
The Spanish football players, who play in the Battle of the Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, have maintained intense activity over the year at league championships and domestic cups and high-level games in European cups such as Champions League.
We also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches to the European and world championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited possibilities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London).
Casillas will take on Costa Rica today and get a new record - 127 international matches for Spain.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his score.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their score. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and medium attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
There's a hundred people approaching Charles Puyol with 97 matches.
Following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Iman are moving left wing Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goalie Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Next only 5 crossed the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albil (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't even exceed 20.
While Nacho Morel has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Viktor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Eder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side it has the most attacks Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the possibility of playing Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That's what the bass player and founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour at the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day will appear from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium together with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview, the entire transcript of which can be found on La Nación’s website.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true, Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica.
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we were barely second and previous experiences.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask, because the group literally loves it here, fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most avid supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people have been talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it cause more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've shown in the last 21 years have been produced in the horizon for several weeks.
We've shown some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope we've gotten in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we look forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungle, and for both of our activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends of surfers, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best surfing places, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tours, you've prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations on what we can't do.
We'll try to do the best we can with a variety of songs. We'll try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we're going to play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them, and we're also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and that we might have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art track.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd stay in it for more than 20 years, which sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given, and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other, and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What meant to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the great ones themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising that when a movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there is a group in the city, but it is much less common for five or ten groups to come out of one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that arose in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
First of all, I think we are all lucky that we are still in this world and second of all, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and this has helped us to open up musical paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to take too many tours because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came here for music, you'll remember that you have to respect music and what you gave it, and you can't let yourself be taken by being famous rock stars, and that's not what any of us ever really cared about.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something magnificent.
As a band, we existed for three years, and we never released any albums until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I smiled with him. It was always a joy to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be tasked with launching a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as jumpers?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions, and we liked this group the most, so we're wondering what Las Robertas will offer alive and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter alive?
That's an Eddie Vedder question, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's adding the first thing he thinks of him.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
First of all, I'm attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwhistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them I could talk all night about bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it's out of style?
I think we've always felt a bit separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I'm going to imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At first, your music was slightly cloudy and now more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting, because I feel that there are a few songs in the new album that are easier to paint, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very grim, although they may sound positive.
At both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deep dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
On Tuesday, former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the lower extremity area, his doctor informed him.
72 - year - old Fujimori, who spends 25 years incarcerated for violating human rights committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including the cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and currently under medical control.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N TV station that Fujimori would be taking tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days to find out why he was in pain and why he was losing his strength in the lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his view Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former President himself does not wish mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of the tongue, he dropped 18 kilograms, and other diseases such as severe erosion gastritis, mucous cyst, kidney stones, high pressure and circulation problems in his legs were added to these problems, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed the murdering squadron an army operating illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica meets with her Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón, on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of extensive meetings with representatives of politics, commerce and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed South American countries on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that remained in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With the said Latin American country, an information exchange agreement has been concluded since January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has been seeking to specify fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "black charter" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has led to the strengthening of the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser's villain, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes to all stores around the world this month has been designed from the beginning to use all the features offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who must tell how the stereoscope without glasses is supposed to work," said a journalist specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially created for this medium", because until this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations to existing titles.
The speaker Nintendo said that apart from the fact that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can start the "second round" at the levels of the games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome all kinds of challenges and "not subject to optical deception".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D also assumes with the return of the figure to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays a note to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from the previous parts. It is the idea that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motions, around, in disguises and also among enemies, Luigi will also appear "playful".
Colom has approved the release of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps on the issue of the issue of the former President Alfonso Portilla, who is to respond to a conspiracy in the United States to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process aimed at having Guatemala respond to a request from a northern country that requires Portilla's release to be tried.
At the Colom Press Conference, he confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issuance.
He assured himself that during his term of office he "did not interfere" with the court decisions and allowed all the editions that had come to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Rouano Marroquín will be issued for murder and serious injury to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Viktor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step is a step of execution after all the judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to prosecute the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the matter of embezzlement 120 million at the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This process was preceded by a release, but the Ministry of Public Affairs withdrew and thus brought the case back into play.
Trinieu helped 6,000 youths in a state of danger
The organisation was created to help children without education so that they would not be at the edge of the company.
The balance of the first 25 years of Trinijo’s social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people who have been threatened with social exclusion have been helped to organize them for 25 years to overcome difficult situations.
This includes the long hundreds of jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Last year, it also served to present a balance sheet under the festive act that took place in the former production premises of Fabra and Coats, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in Trinitat Vella in 1986 to help young people with low education, no work, drug addiction or a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions have participated in the Sant Andre meeting last night, which have been cooperating with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work that Triniov is carrying out.
Along with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education advisor Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current eco-socialist councilor Richard Goma participated in the ceremony.
The current social welfare and family advisor, Josep Lluís Clearies, and the Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also arrived at the Fabra and Coats Grand Chamber.
Mass said that Trinius was born at a very difficult time and that today too there are a number of obstacles, but added that the work the Association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The president outlined Trinius as an example of how to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organisation and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There's been an eviction of a house that's been taken away, where there's been a giant party.
Aliens own 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 invaders left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All evidence suggests that the nightmare experienced by neighbors from 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily a building that they illegally lived in and where they organized giant parties that woke neighbors. They left the building under court order without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, a lock was replaced at the door to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the warden said.
The invaders, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took all the electrical and partially water equipment, also painted the walls and left all the waste behind, in particular cans after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
There's a disco next to the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the building's occupants made her unfairly competitive because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while at the discotheque it cost her 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to react to the neighbors' complaints about noise. However, the problems were not caused by the visitors to the discotheque, but by the residents of the house that was taken, and especially by those who attended the organized parties, whose frequency and intensity had increased in recent weeks, according to the distraught inhabitants of the area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she had been letting her rent.
City police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints over the past few weeks from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP People's Party's Urban Group at the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded last week that "the building be immediately relocated and thus put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one floor was taken a year ago, but in recent months, the invaders had reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there had even been theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to actions against civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday the city police also cleaned out a building in Nou Barris.
At 15 hours 30 minutes the police reached the building 35 on Mont-ral Street after she was summoned by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four of them were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of writing down a procedure that carries with it more than a controversy about fees
The city's 16 gate selection procedure reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the greatest flower, the already disappeared Corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the park Collserola.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metropolis park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was complemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the savages instead of Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate records the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate on the field.
So there's only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's already a subject as sober as two members of this old caste chosen at an elevator meeting hand in hand.
And it was this act that caused one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and university professors think.
Miguel Roland, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayon: The selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldan, after the question of the side of the bay began, "there is a need" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefons Cerda's speech about green apples was not reached to the end.
"We must base on the principle that the most extensive Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, your great availability.
Collserola is more complex," declared the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" carries "lexicological trap" in it: we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of a zone where it is possible to act".
Modol, like Roland and Bayona with experience from the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" of "some danger".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty of the public site project today" after the experience of the 1980s, which in the area of the Forum had "its swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the borders where it should be built.
"Something to define means to take another step," it is essentially to move forward.
"It is necessary to remember the new urban and planning instruments, because those present (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by Patronate de Collserola, who "must not end up in the dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his play, that he will intervene in the project from "the first moment".
He also understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of a pass that allows architects to participate in the debate, but he "questions" that it should be this particular technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds), which should be created: "The architects should be only instruments".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because the basis for the selection procedure lacks a global vision of Collserola: "There were 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longer a study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole".
This causes him, at least, to sign up for all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the Councilwoman should ensure that the zone immediately above Rhonda de Dalt should secure throughout the entire area of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who would be released
After 72 days in prison, the legal officer, Cadino Red, granted mercy to the mayor's brother, Monterey, in a process where he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison, and now he will be released after the legal officer Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the district in question, which dealt with the blackmail case in which Mayor Monterey's brother was charged.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask for the payment of the economic quota to enable the Councilwoman in Monterrey to allow illegal operation in the betting house.
After the public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office initiated the prosecution of the brother of the panic mayor. On 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent number 3 for property crimes he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua, the capital of the state.
He remained there for the next 49 days after the second detention regulation was passed and the public ministry agent denied the possibility of co-involvement or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspected extortion of the owners of Casino Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderately heavy supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On 25 October, he was given an arrest warrant issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that almost two months later, sufficient evidence had been collected to prove Jonas' guilt.
This Monday, the legal authority of Casino Red, Viktor Aldo García Gomez, arrived with Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the mayor's brother. On this basis, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal procedure, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez if the damage had been corrected and which of the associates decided to grant mercy. However, the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process that was brought against him, no complaint can be lodged. Nor can it be requested for damages or punishment.
After being examined by a legal officer around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
A court secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionysio Perez Jácome presented details of the air crash in which the secretary of governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation, in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died, showed that the helicopter had hit the terrain in full force without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that prior to the start of the aircraft the pilot stated that the climate conditions allow for flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings are entangled in the tree branch 25 metres from where the unit lost the hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no parts were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of impact.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Assistance Services, stated that at the time of the crash, the helicopter of the President General Staff was moving at a speed of travel and an accident occurred in a soft terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Perez Jácome listed six key points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must be able to see on the ground during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the appropriate conditions at launch, according to which the aircraft is moving towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of low altitude cloud.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloud, the crew sought a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the impact.
The collision coordinates and the last recording of the radar helicopter are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of flight trajectory before impact.
Dispersal of aircraft remnants in restricted territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on the equal trajectory and on the side.
The design of the dispersal of the aircraft's remains indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the impact on the land.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that several contacts with the mainland may have occurred.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain being weighed, the height of the slope ranged from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images that are likely to break down along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have made contact with the country in several places.
After careful investigation into the vicinity of the accident, no helicopter remains were found in an area more extensive than the area of destination, which reinforces the assumption that the crash occurred in a condition where the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. A study called "Absence Genetics in Children and Youth" will allow you to get results on overweight.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multi-disciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers had been established.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Technical Institute (IPN).
People can come to the IMSS Sports Centres in Valle de México, where youth tests will take place every Saturday from 8 p.m.
He stressed that the research started at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
As soon as data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of obesity development and to identify risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He pointed out that every Saturday anthropometric measurements are performed with all participants (weight, height, waistline), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only boys experienced an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%. The dramatic increase occurred also in the event of overweight,' said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one reason for searching for indicators is that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally obesity genetics are usually explained as inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will be given an overall assessment of the condition of children, thus determining whether they exhibit any known overweight or obesity.
He noted that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles on the neck and the forearms suggests the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential so far, doctors hand it over in writing to their parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to avoid their children’s disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, a day-long TV broadcast and the use of means of transport instead of walking at short distances.
Overweight also causes high calorie intake, this is a higher consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There won't be any mudslides in the UNAM asphalt
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If it were properly cared for, it would not be necessary to correct nearly 200,000 exodus after each rainy period in the Metropolitan Region of Valle de México, pointed out Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty (FQ), who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt landings were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of the effluents, or even it could be completely removed.
In his lecture The technological cause of the effluents that he introduced during the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, thereby creating a mixture of similar characteristics as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight called asphalt, and others with a low molecular weight called maltens. Together, they supply asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like fluid, at 120 degrees high viscosity, and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert warned.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with a flexible tile, which consists of six layers of materials, three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is the asphalt cartridge, which is made of small stones poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms a cartridge is filled with asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the board to disintegrate well.
If it was a modified asphalt, it would have spread even better, a chemical engineer is suspected.
He added that on the asphalt cartridge, the last layer called the coat, made up of fine stones, is also filled with sand in the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle’s edges, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the friction of the carriage.
Given that a heavy load will be placed as part of the landing, the coat must have sufficient thickness and must be kept in mind of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great impact on the function of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it's hard to get out, it causes all the layers of the floor to soften and thus the formation of the wells.
He explained that during the formation of the extremities, the film will be the first to destroy the coat and then damage to the asphalt cartridge. However, there is no damage at one time, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at first signs using suitable maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of bulwarks, and therefore the thickness of each layer of board must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this burden will not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do, and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow us to easily repair the vents without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate in order to become the new Miss Colombia?
The analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not win Miss Colombia's crown.
This is how Valle gets the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca has not reached Miss Colombia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she had found herself on the podium of the winners, won the silver crown and the sherpa, which made her the new first multimiss of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, where she won and the scepter was captured by Miss Atlantico, the department received the 14th title of the first multimission. Melina thus joined the ranks of women from Valle del Cauca, who received the victory crown, but were finally announced by the first multimission. These included Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Alure (2000), Cataldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljudo (2008).
A question many have asked themselves.
The result is the defeat of a great favourite, who in all previous rounds has shown that she has the intention of becoming the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has she become the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joel de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to name her only the First Multimiss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like most and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Literary Edition of Leamos.
She replied to the candidate's question:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in childhood was "Little Prince", a very profound book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this answer was not appreciated because of the term "culturalise" and secondly because the candidate did not explain to her what the individual books mentioned mentioned to her.
After the end of Melina's ceremony, she declared that she was at peace and was happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read it if you can.
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the candidate was the most popular, most famous and the one who took all the previous prizes (Oster’s Gastronomy Challenge, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen’s Mother), aroused the envy of the other candidates, stressing the queen, who then burned down on stage.
It was seen at the first presentation of swimsuits on Hilton Beach and during two exhibitions before the final coronation.
Even though she was both radiant, she was aware that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by representatives from Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's title for the first multimiss confirms the fact that the candidate who receives the most titles during the competition does not end up with the queen's crown."
In addition, Valle has been taking a rather unkind attitude toward the media in recent days, and it has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just two days before the election, an international jury member named Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia's competition beauty is not enough in itself, it is necessary to see more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle lost points because of the lack of her background and the fibrosis that was visible on her buttocks. This is totally contrary to the verdict of the jury, which was chosen by Miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with ass fibrosis, which, in my opinion, was not too obvious, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that a cousin from Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and this is where she chose her tax."
Because of this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after a swimsuit show there was a cruel prediction that had been fulfilled. It was argued that this was a satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had allowed not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether true or not, it is certain that Melina began her year of reign today, not as queen, but as princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it will be recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the crushing success in Cartagena, did not reach the crown.
That was the job of the Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cana.
An expert on fingerprints from Cali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alphons Cane".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the top leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", and by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working for the CTI department, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad, who has worked for 21 years in the field of forensic research, was in line this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked on a town hall in Chocó, where he often had to penetrate the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle, and after he had completed his courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints.
The week the operation was carried out against Alfonso Cane, Eliazar was told to bring his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He left for Cauco on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest Guerilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the body, he did not recognize it because of physical vision.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in a given area, without glasses, much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with Galton's magnifying glass, ink, and transplanter and light, Eliazar began to compare the dead's dactyl records with the card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him. It was Alfonso Cano.
That very night, a man from Puerto Tejad was assigned to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm whether it was really Commander Farc.
Search Stop
For a dactyloscope from Sijin de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed Eliazar González at the press conference is very important.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We're gonna take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall because in this place the thief resisted to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a complete handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or reverse suspicion in the case of a murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
On the basis of the investigation, one of the family members responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he really was a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The expert on fingerprints from CTI explained that the objects "are wiped with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that at present there are many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that flashes, it's not gold, not everything you touch, there's traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison shall be made.
"Indignation" protest in New York
Hundreds of manifestomen were in trouble at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to settle.
Most of them waited for an order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Movement Cast Wall Street provoked New York officials on Tuesday, trying to get back to Manhattan Square in the morning. Then they tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestomen were in distress at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to, thanks to a court order that allowed the "rejected" to return to the site. The second part of the movement responded to the clearing by taking the park north of the city where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue in a legal battle to return to Zukotti, both through meetings and peaceful events," said one of the speakers of the movement "Let's take Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray made it clear that the response of the "angered" to the relocation of the camp ordered by the mayor of New York himself, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced relocation of the site and allowing the manifestists to continue to reside here.
In addition, they took another park situated at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the farm in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and detained some of the manifestos. Bray didn’t know the exact number, but he said that he saw that some journalists were wearing handcuffs.
The organization assures us that hundreds of people have settled on the ground, and also delegations of religious representatives have come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A trial is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the moved manifestists even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who were guarding the square, causing "some small clashes", Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the manifesto.
The court order forbids the authorities to move members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or to use "the laws that were published after the ban began, or to prohibit manifestors from accessing the park with shops or other places that they previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that in view of this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of the public space and the demonstrators have pointed out that local laws prevent them from returning tents and sleeping bags.
The city's highest representative personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and joined because the manifesto "contravened the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to hurt others", because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared the quality of their lives".
"Early clearance was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added the spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also stated that they plan to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade organisations to remind them of the two months after which the protests are taking place.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bubble and other important Canadians will appear in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
The Canadian woman Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", a wife of a year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Miss Mary on a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
Today, a private TV station CTV announced that Anderson and a singer of sentimental songs Michael Bubble and other important Canadians will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st and will embody the Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV has shown footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary in the picture of the doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appeared on the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as moderator on the tour "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheena.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer named Bublé appears on the special Christmas broadcast of CTV, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bubble called America's Kim Kardashian at one of her New York concerts "a tough one".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends the period of downturn that began in March
Since March of last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has risen in the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have estimated material losses to $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of the fall, GDP between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page with certainty: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - also assume the highest growth rate compared to the January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partly explained by buying the machines necessary to restore areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, expenditure decreased by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to emerge from it, or to rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The currents were placed in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "savory values" for investors who are fleeing the debt crisis from the euro area and from the alarming forecasts of the US. It is a privilege which, however, is a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While markets continue to be surrounded by the EU’s marginal countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid rise in yen," Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
And really, the perspectives aren't very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which envisions instability in the world economy, showed that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
She dropped four tenths to 100,4 points compared to 100,8 in August.
The euro area even reached under the average of 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Insecurities
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is increasingly involved in a labyrinth that leads to an exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The view that the "conciliation" of the new transitional Greek government is given rather than by the genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new austerity measures would in no way support and reiterated his request to write new elections on the anticipated date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the 26 October summit decision," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence for the government.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not explain any doubt about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have no commitment to anything else."
The chairman of the conservatives went to the EU address and the IMF a little far, and these organisations are supposed to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he also said he would not support and sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, angry at the impact of the referendum on Papandreou, stressed that its requirements are inextricable: it does not block any assistance unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguities and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs Speaker Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government about "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion.
The Greek tradition has so much more to do with what it's about.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen raises Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at global level with regard to microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia yesterday recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades to this instrument of cooperation, whose essence is that "this is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th World Summit of Microloans in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve half the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, i.e. with an amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", the Queen of Sofia stressed, which hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to which these loans are intended above all.
"We have achieved much already" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The Microloans Summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to reach 100 million families above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of microloans has expanded to Spain and to other states of the world after "a pioneer of Muhammad Yunus's idea went on this journey", the queen said, adding that it is an act of justice and necessary recognition".
She described this instrument's father as "a wonderful idealist who set out to fight poverty". She introduced her work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet his loan policy on the spot.
The first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to observe a steady development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title "head of the family" in Valladolid yesterday.
The Queen of Sofia concluded her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions and thus allowing them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez has declared solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to which all democratic states must govern.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to combine cooperation with developing countries only with a period of balochiness, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and fair policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criterion and not allow solidarity to become the victims of cuts.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secret for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed participants in the city, which "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity which is contagious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general electoral law
On Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) was held without serious difficulties for Chancellor and President Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Party.
The question of Europe's future on the programme was originally not, but it happened only in autumn, in particular to be satisfied with the members of the parties who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians as easy.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the Commission, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegations were against it and 10 delegations abstained.
A few minutes' ovation stands at the end of Angela Merkel's performance and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor of Europe, "the time has come for change".
This could be reflected in the changes in the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
This is one of the ideas adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Surely it is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom is opposed and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is out.
Likewise, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's board of directors depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in strengthening Germany's weight.
She was concerned about calming the climate within her side, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to get Congress to talk about "small" European states or countries that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for Europe addresses one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
It's only indirect.
Reminding her that there was a bloody battle at Leipzig just two hundred years ago.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is deception in working incompetence?
After the aid, the UMP party and the government launched an offensive against incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address the topic of the repetitive debate since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but is not less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on labour incapacity.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the company's consent, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring €280 million.
As well as measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic scope: give public employees one day of unrequited incapacity (so far no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority also raises the subject of fraud, which this time focuses on fraud involving labour incompetence.
"Controls will be much more extensive and in addition: if you are caught, you will be back," Xavier Bertrand warned in an interview given to the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the inequity in labour.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that has brought their fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance of Malaysia (CNAM - State health insurance companies), more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008 daily reimbursements amounted to 5% of health expenditure with their 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity allowances and occupational injuries and 54% related to labour incapacity, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French averaged 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contains some deviations: another poll published in 2007 on Monster.com's job opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed responded that they did not choose any day of incapacity.
Another study, conducted this time by sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone than elsewhere to incapacity.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or non-health reasons) was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Betraying in job failures is only a very small part compared to working in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity of "unauthorised or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences of more than 45 days, 11% of the cases of "unadjusted or unauthorised" were counted at 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
So a total of 169,000 "unauthorised" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing black work.
According to MEP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent between €9 and €15 billion missing in the year's tax collection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus never more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered these words to Parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"In order to put our economy back on track again, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget rescue plan," the Chief of Government announced when he delivered his first public speech Wednesday to start a vote of confidence in Parliament.
The application of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the "prime task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the vicinity of 9%" of the gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras voiced his support for the measures already approved Monday to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party does not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed meeting with Members for his part New Democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU do not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all parties supporting the measures envisaged, replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalised, says the committee of experts
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are denied death.
In matters of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is living on the idea of resisting death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and making decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends that the Government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quoted a recent survey by an independent agency, Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to cultures in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This average applies to Canada as a whole, while in Québec the highest number is 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide does not change anything.
According to experts who have also falsified the controls of all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against persons who are unfit or disagreeable.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference more than many cases of these frauds in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also taking place in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians tend to euthanasia
Recall that according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are broadcasting a message that the lives of old or disabled persons are worth less.
With regard to those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those questioned feel that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or interrupting care for the patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be trained to respect the rejection of end-of-life treatment without fear of prosecution.
In matters of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered to be considered no longer to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report of the Royal Canadian Society’s experts.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" because, inter alia, he does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks like the authors of the report are building the autonomy of a person above all other values that create a social advance for society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also voiced "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, particularly doubts the date of the report concerning the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the American state of Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to resign
Damasek talks about "complet"
Syria is becoming more isolated
Last night, supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures intensified in Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and speaks of a "complet" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union increased its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call upon President Bashar al-Assad to kill in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed, "to surrender power".
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to make a demission, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that efforts to mediate Turkey under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said with an emphasis on neighbouring Syria, against which Turkey is applying increasingly hard lines.
The United States rejoiced in the "encouragement of consensus against Assad and the unfair conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are using an increasingly harsh tone" against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During this time, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in the city of Deraa in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the area of Homs.
However, during the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
After all, he also responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus's membership, which, according to him, is "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow down", he added, with the assurance that "competences drawn against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering "the mechanism for the protection of civilians" and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also favors the idea of sending observers to the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which he believes is "paranoid".
The new Special Meeting of the League is called for tomorrow to be held in Rabat to deliver an opinion on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December, and which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of armies from cities bound by riots and the release of prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov considered the decision of the League of Arab States "mistakeful" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but completely avoided supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices for the Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a programme that will contain "problems" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months by the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unionists and employers today.
It should draw up a relatively thin cabinet composed of non-Parliamentary technocrats.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the designed Prime Minister.
The President of the Parliament, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti, by Friday, to ask Parliament to express its confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Georgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy pays precise deadlines" with regard to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that "it is certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was welcomed from the outset, but his concern again arose after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team involving mainly technocrats, even though he stressed that he would also like to join "policies".
He expressed the conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to the President of the Gianfrance Parliament, the new government will have confidence in Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking office, promised to act with extraordinary urgency and to make Italy a strong member" of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013 and requires new hard measures.
The head of the business union Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who meets with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "or a country that does not show growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolising, according to the authors of the editorials, "call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents "emotional change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place state bonds for 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for nuclear weapons, an American non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is building on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents that are not available from this UN agency when identifying a scientist.
Last week, the IAEA reported its "serious concern" about the "potential military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of ISIS, drawing widely from IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (No. 1934) should have worked three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he should be involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to start a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was then to cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that the development of the Iranian detonation system" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his working career in this technology under the country's military nuclear programme from where he came from".
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Delicts Rise by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in total in anti-religious crimes and delicts.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen very easily to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% according to the FBI were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and delicacies rise again," stressed Human Rights First on human rights, "the rise of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," the organisation added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hateful crimes".
"Hateful crime" in US federal law is the legacy of civil rights fighting.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The website providing micro-blogging services Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of followers, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers of "activity" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of other persons who are watching you or persons whose answers ("tweets") you are watching.
This allows us to know whether they allow us to monitor the contributions, whether they are entering new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was distributed to the entire network on Monday, the AFP spokeswoman Twitter Carolyn Penner told the agency.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of the post of someone else, postfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and ceui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately consider the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," says @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better to follow some of the elements of my Twitter," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the Golden Rule on a Balanced Budget into the Constitution
The government of the great coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enter the "gold rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible reduction in Austria's evaluation by credit rating agencies (AAAs).
It was the socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of a ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% higher than the criterion of the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year," argued multi-officer and foreign minister Michael Spindelegger, Christian Democrat.
Austria thus follows the request of the euro area summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be entered into the constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while both the federal and the municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to obtain public debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene as we did last, if we find too much instability" in the exchange rate of yen, explained Senator Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he returned to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently surpassed the dollar record since 1945.
But only since then has he regularly increased the promotion of the purchase of investors who consider it a "safe haven" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar again reached below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic patch of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This burning of the Japanese currency harms the island's exports because it irritates the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the profits obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currencies.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the wave of tsunamis that devastated the region of Togo in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this betrayal of Jenu will not yet be killed in a fragile recovery egg.
The third world economic power restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in the light of the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of export growth and consumption of households burdened with disaster.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high value of yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japan Central Bank (BoJ) to launch its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken Jen.
But the deputy governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already taken "relevant measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) of its purchases of State Treasury vouchers and increased to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates are rising, stock markets are failing
The risk of the disease of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European stock exchange remains concerned about the stability of the euro area today, Tuesday 15 November, is falling into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 o'clock the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% at 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions surrounding the yields from the euro area loans that are in difficulty, markets with shares around the world continue to account for only a fraction of the recent profits."
"The nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of the disease," explains Terry Pratt, broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closing down by 0.7%, which suffered from market concerns about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will continue only in the narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainties about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been getting to the lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a drop of 0.4%.
According to currency brokers, the currency ceased after the CDU party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's congress adopted a proposal Monday, providing for the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries in difficulty without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very alarming.
This morning, Italy's ten-year bond yields 6.85% on Tuesday, and Spain's ten-year bond yield is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to raise the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, urged the markets to make time for him to remedy the situation in Italy threatened with poisoning caused by the amount of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit would be the "prime task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the deliberate market line when elections to the House of Representatives are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference between the ten-year bonds between Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE, however, revised downwards in the second quarter to decrease by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, Germany registered growth by 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will cause a double demand for electricity by 2050 if we don't want a large part of the world's population to lose important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face a lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is the topic currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains solely in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which submits its decision to find any other source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which considers it right to build only power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil to quote at least some countries continue to make a determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality resists it.
Berlin's choice will be demonstrated by an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European Championship in wind power plants, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularity, causing CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices to be higher by 65%, or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay the invoice for electricity by 40% higher than what the French households pay.
While, in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illusion of the beautiful declaration of the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they fundamentally do not oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us remind ourselves that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 emerging jobs.
The highly-exporting sector is taking a large number of small and medium-sized specialised businesses, which cannot be transferred abroad, to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion a year for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer's downturn would be planned?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, or that there is no devilish one.
The development of low-carbon plants, nuclear facilities and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French industry group AREVA, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have the State Department of Nuclear Safety, which conducts non-compromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island happened under normal conditions of operation and was left without human sacrifices and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of the reactor and the inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident just as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that the EPR-type reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of the Areva Group and EDF and freeing the way to empower leading positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machination dominate the debate so decisive for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the absorption of the police, courts and administration of the numbered policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status "of human rights" which France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, who became current when the Minister of Interior (see the Liberia Letter of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, walls and waitresses".
But so far, it's only ever been discussed at the angle of economics.
It must be said that in this area there is a very broad correlation between left and right.
To the right of the tone in 1976 Jacques Chirac stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrant workers are located" and on the left Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the hordes of Polish installers on French territory was shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are destined to provide to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande limits himself to banality by stating that joint development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Restrictions on immigration hinder growth and damage employment.
Concerns about the effects of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to lower their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in understaffed sectors.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is insufficient.
Positive impact on wages
As a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the increase in migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants brought in contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany one immigrant who is 30 years of age will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to arrive at the missing percentage of growth "with valued teeth".
These teeth used to repel immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be considered
Democracy is rare and also very fragile.
The European continent should remember that, although it invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and make it as direct as possible.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General electoral law, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "tool of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, departmental organization and power control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been so since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the error of the Greek yes-no referendum in this respect will have the value of dual disclosure: revealing the need for a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its inability, its inadequacy.
This ambition must be considered in order to be overcome.
It is true that the front lines of democratic hunting have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we demand a number of national referenda organized according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianca exposed to a European absolute monarch or a leap with her feet tied to an empty nationalistic depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want knives of guillotine, but together, full, peaceful and continuous performance of selection and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop it - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is an entire Europe that bows to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is an entire Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
It is imperative to return to the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to rid themselves of the governments of the markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will foresee decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
You bet.
But to think without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new stage in European building.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" the republicans.
The revolution couldn't have been enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
Uncontacted chip cards are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world chip card fair.
According to Eurosmart's office, 2011 should end with an increase in world card sales with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) of 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most bearable is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in public transport or to arrange purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total card market (6,925 million cards).
After having been in the APEC for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in a non-contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But big chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million uncontactable Pass MasterCard tickets this year.
In order to include a higher rate of speed, it is necessary for banks to equip their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their customers a touchless bank card," says Gérard Nebouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But it's only the first stage of the future's payment tool: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of instruments are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication).
"They're late."
"But their real swing should take place next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales worldwide to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test in Caen, which will take place from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of about 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a cap allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Societte General announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the alliances between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion that there are alliances between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "became secure from now on".
"The way both organisations operate, and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After AQMI members were abducted from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers during the operation carried out by special French troops.
The French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephones with terrorist-owned chips in their sockets after the attack.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several individuals in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maidugura, a city in northern Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It is progress, but there is no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we begin to discuss operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect is looking forward to external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in Boko Haram's development and manifestations or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same way of execution as those used by AQMI.
The international community has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram posed.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics as of little interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maidugura around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link has rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict observance of Islamic Shari law, while its supporters are fighting against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, supporters of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is, as usual, still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Yusuf is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and left its post in the north.
At Christmas 2010 he will kill 80 people in the city of Jos, then another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters on his first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is worrying all security specialists from now on.
Now that Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and games and the Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe, he said that France is in state of emergency and is ready to "deliver all information".
World According to Presidential Candidates
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are being exaggerated in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world by means of simple or even simplistic thoughts?
In listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is a traditionally strong point of the republicans.
Often, unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or Israel’s assistance are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened the occupation of the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusation "for manipulating their currency", which is a topic of concern in America driven by the migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse still, if this must include starting a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama to China, and the only candidate with any sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost shuddered at a position that "coordinates" emotion.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the final polling stations, remains insubordinate.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance by accusing Obama of failing to deal with this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best candidate, proves a embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - an apparent unknown fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he is ready to send the US Army to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone's far away from the Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy, in 2008.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the sudden departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses for Libya, and thus give him a sign of weakness
But the attack is not easy.
The population is assessing President Obama's national security policy, which has been removed by Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention that leads to obstruction.
And with arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to be able to resuscitate its leadership, Obama knocks on the right place.
Nord Stream, new port of Russian gas to Europe
The far-off Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and running along the Baltic Seabed has started to work.
They must supply a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together a controlling valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
This new pipeline starts to flow into Western Europe every year with the first pipeline of 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas, connecting the region of St. Petersburg to the federal country of Mecklembur-Pomorana.
The second pipeline, to be completed at the end of 2012, will allow for a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the amount equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested the project.
Nord Stream will actually allow the gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being driven over the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At once, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", with a reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created gaps between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia was barely able to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are nearing their end five years ago.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated the point at which the major gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in a large number in Lubmin, the gas induction point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical activity.
Submarine pipes are made of steel equipped with a concrete cloak to protect them from anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea in an average depth of 200 m.
When it was built, it was necessary to avoid minefields from World War II.
"For their safety, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect fauna and flora were also needed.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffels, which is nowhere to be interrupted by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were only a little eager to see the Russian state company established on their coasts.
"In the event of a malfunction, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," Jens Müller points out.
In the event of a lack of closeness, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welds were designed to create a lack of intimacy once every 100,000 years.
The external gas pipeline shall be checked by a submarine robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline shall be controlled by a device that circulates within.
This unit of cigar shape with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pressed by gas.
The target shall provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts throughout the three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s.
The long-distance pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any minor repairs needed.
The gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar on start and 100 bar on target.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% share.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as by the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased this company for five years with a contract that could be renewed all its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will benefit from total capacity, any amount of real gas transported," Jens Müller points out.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF group, Suez's investment costs went up to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned to them, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine trees.
The vents are an output gate of about five feet [4.5 m] high.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received 1 million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - branded recorder
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to re-enjoy writing.
It smells like adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine is easily discernable by its black rectangular boards and by its leaves sent white colors as if by age.
Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to place on the market a new design but distended record.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is taking the form of a new product.
The recorder is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (impersonation of the skin), which is used for e.g. to adjust the surface of benches.
This type of journal was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to his favorite old and forgotten subject, which was the icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the Modo Modo brand.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle in 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years, where only 3,000 journals were produced.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the recorder takes over the business as well as the student or professionals.
The image of Moleskine is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now has almost 100 employees, and since 2008 it has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his logs to bookstores and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the centers of cities where he was able to enforce his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the violent development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their journal.
In August on the occasion of the Locarn Film Festival, she also presented new recordings of a notebook resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, bookcases ... The brand is extended to a wide range of carriers.
Success, which aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today, the 15th week of disabled employment opens.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is it exclamating?
"No, he's underlining Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, there was not a percentage of the unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"There's nothing left to do."
It must be said that there are many obstacles to unemployed people before they enter the workplace.
These are elderly: 37% is over 50 (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have no degree and out of 2.3 million high school students there are only 10,000 disabled.
Finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in disabled people compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses receive disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
Unspoken, there are ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
Studies conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cite Association found that the surveyed managers have a "weak level of knowledge of disabled persons" with an "excessive idea of people in driving chairs and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the goal of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers from 2008 give a status equal to 2.6%.
"Now we are moving about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph's organisation entrusted with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "punished" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 more guilty companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "Good luck"
Before Tuesday evening (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We're not going to go that far to write that there was a union between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stand stage Stade de France briefly and well Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach directed only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, "it's the same thing, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my brand."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday night because of this fight against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light up".
The term "joy" cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from 7 years of age and in their winning pulls in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More than that, because "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)" reminds us.
"We were cruising right away."
"The power to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Good-hearted Leekens reminded me of the "growl".
"Frozenness" to fight "save-save."
"Hordness" also noted in the quality of "neighbors", that France became a team of very high levels again more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc has done a great deal of work," he gasped.
Although Belgium will be missing from the next European Championship, a technical football player would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with a French... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians are going to be big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next fight." Including against France.
Portugal very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football team, whose helm is since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is dividing from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
There's only one game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
With the awareness of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of the Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of leverage, but it was unable to give such a rare goal that would ease it.
"It's a good result, however, which contains a risk because we haven't scored outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will come before an audience that should create a boiling boiler, even though the match definitely appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but a bright thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have it on top," said a two-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being on Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroze, a follower.
The indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match may suffice for Bosnians who also need to score.
"It is a good result, however, which contains a risk, because we have not scored outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing the Bosnian team immediately from the beginning the maximum pressure so that "they will not give them time to think."
It's a good idea, provided this time it turns out to be realistic.
