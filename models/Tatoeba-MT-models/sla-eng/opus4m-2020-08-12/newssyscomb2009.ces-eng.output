The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
The strong weakening of both sides of the current major coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have led to Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Korutan hejtman Jörg Haider, is planning a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains 29.8 per cent of the vote, but loses 5.5 per cent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, ÖVP lost 25.6 percent of its vote.
These are the worst results of both major parties in Austrian post-war history and especially among the people who called for early elections, literally a disastrous result.
As early as July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a significant lead in favour of SPÖ.
But the voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation was expressed about the possible resignation of the party's president and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Party.
Such a development would likely facilitate the way towards an increasingly likely outcome from the election result, namely the restoration of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) gained 18% in advance and the 11% BZÖ vote - at the same time, however, the social Democrats voiced concerns about the repetition of 1999 when the people agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the BZÖ split off) from the joint government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
It is clear that Haider is betting on this development, which has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna for national policy.
The Green Party has yet to enter parliament, but it has slightly lost and has fallen between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the four percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused of illegal collection of bugs in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister mentioned it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherg.
"If it hadn't been solved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after a meeting that had taken place from the Czech initiative.
Mukhergji said after the meeting that it could be difficult for the executive power to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Švácha, who had been acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government could deal with the local government in Darjiling, within whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučer sentenced to three years in prison, Mukhergji would be best advised to appeal to a higher authority.
Then he could apply for bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself equally during the negotiations.
"It recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the whole matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side was already providing such assistance.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognise it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said before his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it indeed a profound mistake to incarcerate and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question of whether he had received promises from the Indian side to deal with things, the minister avoided.
"I have received quite enough promises already," he said only.
Czech judges the battle for the seabed
It will access the wall electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent maritime area are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, along with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member United Nations Division of Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors and sometimes completes the interpretation.
There's a working elan and excitement here.
The seabed hides a world so far not known, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, ores, and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
A bottom greater than a mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to vehemently move towards new sub-sea territory.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights under which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres off the coast of the country.
It has an exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of continental shell.
"Simplifiedly, behind the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It reaches beyond the coastline, often beyond two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the determination of the outer limits of the continental shell shall be supported by a comprehensive scientific technical documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last mentioned countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The world’s voice recently recorded Australia’s success, which was the first to significantly expand its submarine states.
But New Zealand - the size of the seabed that the commission admitted to it last week - is about 1.6 million square miles [1.6 million km], about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as promised, be invaluable.
They shall submit their applications gradually to other States.
They can do that within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, a convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
No other state has an exclusive position here.
The right of exploitation in this area is granted by the Convention to established international institutions.
"But there is no Klondajk at sea," says director Mikulka at stake, saying that his "unitary areas are legally defined and their regime contractually anchored".
The Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the "Interoceanmetal" joint organisation.
It was awarded in 1991 by the Convention, as were investors of a few other states, the status of the so-called "prompt investor".
He has the right to claim in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The investor's research area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's some kind of submarine replica of Tater.
"It can be mined on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic nodules containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division is showing one such nomad.
It reminds us of a small potato or, in a little fantasy, a fabulous scheme that legend says revived the Golem.
Germany’s special deployment units were in the process of bailing out hostages
The Egyptian government has requested assistance from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation was reversed, special units were ready, but no deployment was made.
Further details of the circumstances of the liberation of 11 abducted European tourists in Egypt are gradually made available to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, the German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue.
According to the ministries, both members of the federal army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police were on the spot of liberation,9 the flights of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilverswerk).
However, according to another communication by the speakers, both ministries of Monday afternoon did not need German forces because the kidnappers had their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"It was not fortunate," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of passengers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian guides on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After being abducted in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages moved to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, the rescues are fine in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of hostages is in the care of the German Embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of his release.
No information is yet available in Berlin when rescue will return to Germany.
According to Bild, all five tourists should fly with special forces to one of the German Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The US House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress left a $700 billion bailout.
The Dow Jones index has fallen sharply.
Between 206 and 227 votes were rejected by the US House of Representatives of the Government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both sides, the majority did not find a programme to alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
Dramatic action was desperately sought by supporters to convince critics of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the MP to say yes before the vote, although, he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index dropped by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The concern of investors was that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose so that, after the notification of the collapse of the package, the package would fall again steeply.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, there was a marked increase in turnover in the next month's booking period - even more than 30 per cent during the winter season compared to the previous year.
Despite the weak economic growth, the German's desire to travel remains undisturbed.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover by 31 percent compared to the same period last year as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, an increased number of reservations are available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover was about 11 per cent higher in October than in 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which evaluate each month the reservation data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolate them into the overall market.
This result included the booking of tours which took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to a weak dollar rate, travel to the U.S. is wanted above all, the DRV said.
For these journeys, an increase of about one third makes reservations.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable for Germans.
First of all, organized tours are in course, announced by DrV Chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure on energy and food, the costs are "easy for the customer than for the individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, inter alia, using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months it was said that the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year a higher turnover will be recorded - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
End-to-end repeat navel, pint beer and mints in cutters from well-known designers.
For the first time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderator, and she wears a well-dressed cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer meadow, and we're already getting hit by photographers and heavy memory cards - that's flattering, because I'm on Octoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north of the sausage equation, and so my sense of comfort in the dress was rather limited.
But right after he got to Theresienwiese, everything's better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's dress or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The special views of the banana stand in chocolate are just my apron.
One nun reminds me that I misbound her: "You're free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, widowed in the back."
I'll move my bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't do so much work and wear simple flat hats with the sign "It drunk to get dressed!" and stick on walking naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
It's like "gorgeous," with an extended "oh".
That's what he tells me after you've relieved yourself of a drink.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
So Bob is one of the dreaded Wildbieslers, as they call it in Bavaria in public for people who pee freely.
Others have no luck getting rid of alcohol this way.
Around 8 p.m., they run around the area where Oktoberfest takes place, in good faith, doctors who have to take care of the poor drunkards.
The medics always show up in the flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most of the visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Whoever's lying under the sails of this millet coffin can't be seen.
"It's the ones that can't go on anymore," one of the nurses will call me in answer to my question and disappear into the crowd.
Police have released the victim's name.
The name of the 30 - year - old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was published.
An accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon caught Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, an 11 - year - old man was arrested for suspected reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to seek entry into the European Union, European powers sought to penetrate Turkey's borders.
On the eastern coast of Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments to this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neorenaissance style.
That's what tourist guides tell you.
The building sits around at the end of the platform with a tower on every corner of the front, overlooking the ignorance of a provincial German council.
The stone's dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a person gets inside a vault, he can no longer doubt the size of a company whose westernmost gate of the station was.
In August 1908 the German consortium of Anatoli-Bagdad Corporation opened the station.
Germany, which became involved in the game of empires late, had in mind its ambition to control the Middle East to implement through this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops marched from Egypt and pushed Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came for Hydrapash station.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed her worked roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Ever since then, she's been getting slutty and she's been around history.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now being implemented - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was supposed to meet one of the ACP's leading experts on foreign policy, Turkish Ambassador Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a frivolous ride along the tracks, which reminded the ancient world rhythms of the famous document Night's Post, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main station of the ACP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on a developing suburb, surrounded by half-deployed commercial houses and power shops, where middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to do early morning trades.
Suat Kinikilioglu could easily be a centre-right policy from almost any other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But surely the moment will come," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkish," he said, "you didn't want such a decision to happen."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are also for the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe as a whole seems to be able, metaphorically speaking, to take these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydrapasha Station, after most of the waking night, I was thinking of the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Remembrances: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11th) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Congregation.
As part of the county musical plan, the excellent body of young Proteus founded the year.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but at the time that Proteus sang his last song in 1979, there were several of us almost 30 — we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeshifter) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to engage in any music that was presented to him - whether madrigali or Messiaen, whether alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often stunning, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Todd just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it!"
His tactical technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
Wherever the music standard was, he still raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was supposed to fit on the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was conducting Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to him, simply "were dragging one or two leaky ovens around the world".
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSC, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's notes by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he studied economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed his dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication by the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 years in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photos are amazing.
They tied me to the simplicity and strength with which the viewers are affected and to the consideration and respect of the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments."
The Honda will strike the second time with its best seller
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already has a significant space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase the comfort of driving and enable more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-space vehicle.
It is important to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes into the market six years after the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was put on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million sold pieces in six years.
The Honda, however, aims to increase sales in its category.
So while this Japanese company sold 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 the estimate is 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
Driving is therefore de facto expected to end the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, meaning 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, the Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company then expects to reach 2%.
In order for Honda to achieve this share, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door compact-size hybrid with a length of 4.37 metres, from which a Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 pieces a year worldwide.
As regards markets, it is estimated that 50 % of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed by the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the sale of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of the following year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grew in all dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (by 5 centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (by 2 centimeters more) and the decoupling to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of 5 centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1,52 metres.
There has also been an increase in the size of the internal space.
However, this advantage was achieved by using a new platform, as well as by storing a fuel tank in the middle of a car that was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with engine 1.4, since the volume of luggage space at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement, apart from external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an opening angle of 80 degrees from 67 degrees to the first model of Jazz.
In the second generation, Honda Jazz has new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvement of the propulsion system at the same time as a high torque in the full range of engine speeds.
The first 1.2 litre engine has 90 horse power at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 revolutions.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
To progress in the development of disaster-protective technologies, Nissan was inspired this time in nature, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes the role of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Progress Centre developed, in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research, the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhir Doie, CEO of public relations for the technology, research and development of the brand, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan security shield.
The robot is tasked with strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
However, the most important are complex bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, allowing bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, engineers proposed what they called laser range finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to two metres in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"At the moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot imitates the bees' movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot can't move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction that it is allowed by turning its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as for bees.
Therefore, Nissan used the rotation function in addition to accelerating and slowing down to prevent the robots from crashing.
"The device only needs every few seconds to process information and according to these data to be maintained.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, which can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about giga or mega."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate collision prevention, the technology in which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the installation of a unit in the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy the fear before you take the mortgage
It should be recognised that the US Ministry of Finance, apart from having sufficient capital to give injections, does not lack ingenuity.
It faces a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at banks with dubious solvency, it created a popular-science game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "Bad Loans Hotel"... or a mixed hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look gloomy, so that once or twice and three times one will consider whether the right time is to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
This page is more suitable for young people than for the public at large.
And what happens when the game is over?
Inside the hotel will appear a room of dreams.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley's banking house announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, is issuing nine billion dollars to earn 21% of its capital.
A week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intended to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a single $25.25 price, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
MuFG invests another six billion dollars to obtain convertible securities that will provide 10% of its income and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and made it to $23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger is an important opportunity on the way to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the statute of banking," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow him to distinguish his activities, but it also places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest Wall Street essay to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago we thought," explained Tokyo's Toshiide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist solely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to limit the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley for the securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that in a year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if the latter are to be exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50 % above the exchange price, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures him that the capital that MuFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the speaking group refused to provide precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast the Tier One balance of payment capacity of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, he has been "sensitiously" reducing his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of default associated with the debt have increased sharply.
On Monday, these costs took on the opposite development, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" from the major Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Reestablish a republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is a joint project by Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed put to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission was completed, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum 'yes'.
According to these results, 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two surveys conducted at the exit from the polls and the budget of a non-governmental organisation predicted a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, with a range of 63 % to 70 %.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his proposal for the Constitution last night on Monday.
"The Constitution won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians in the seat of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quita.
He understands that Rafael Correa received a blessing from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the United States of America (OEA), took place peacefully, referred to the text on 444 points building up the "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution devotes the power of the state over the economy by pronouncing to it the "planning of development" of countries living primarily from oil production by foreign companies and from the foreign currency they send to their migrants.
The proposal protected by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, who will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this power and that a new mandate will be requested in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to introduce in a country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it is a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point for American drug operations.
19 hostages were freed in Chad
The Egyptian command took the attack of 11 tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported to the capital of Egypt on Monday.
During the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian command.
Hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, close to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations.
"They are perfectly healthy" and "no ransom was paid to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garran announced on the train track.
Since its capture on 19 September during a safari in a vehicle driven by all four wheels at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to another 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of Aegyptus Agency, organizer of safari.
A leader of the Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 members of the special forces who had approached the site on board two helicopters had gone to the fold during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half the kidnappers were killed and the others escaped," said this source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, by special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
The night before, the Sudanese army announced that it had stopped the vehicle with all four wheels on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the news pages with thumb headlines and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still overlooked.
Who will rise up to finance the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memory sites that are starving?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they will ignore their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Québek, as in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of just the Chinon Castle in the Valley of Loira?
For our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Québek, in the Federation of Society for the History of Québek, there are at least 40,000 volunteers associated with 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to uncover history, preserve a collection of private archives and protect archeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, which driven hopelessly protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally meet the stands for history and monuments?
Benelux governments are the national part of Fortis Bank
The States of Benelux will help the Belgian-Holand Fortis Bank, which became the first in Europe to get into trouble because of the increasing impact of the US mortgage market crisis, partly increasing: three countries will support a monetary and insurance institution, which also has capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed on this weekend at the highest level with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be seen as precedents in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year.
Within the meaning of the decision that was made on Sunday night, all three countries will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s property there.
The Bank will sell a part of its capital participation with absolute certainty, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis’s actions began to decline sharply last week, and serious signs of the crisis had already appeared in the institution during the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large with 85,000 employees to let it fail.
The company's securities fell only on Friday by 12 percent, to a 14-year minimum.
Since January the stock value has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the group’s total market value is around EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company’s leading representatives.
The management of the company still blames Fortis for the collapse of the foreign market uncertainty associated with the adoption of the $700 billion US package.
On Monday, stocks have risen slightly.
On Friday, a new director-general, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has applied.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients, and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and also purchased several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the bidder on the basis of people's data on the purchase of medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the henman to the fox," quoted Washington Post by Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
Insurance companies shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health status of the applicants and, if the risk is assessed as too large, shall not even close the insurance with it.
They had previously sent the medical examinations concerned, and they only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number of the customer from the drugstores, it is easy to find out what medication he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself produces, how he suffers from the disease and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol - reducing medicines, it indicates that he has practically uncontrollably high levels of blood fat, which immediately puts him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some at the same time determine the risk ratio, so there is almost no work left in the insurance company, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that lecteric drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds, for example, are used against migraine or fits of heat, but are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, although the difficulties initially identified are not significant.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, special companies have been set up to request permission from pharmacists before providing the necessary information.
That is what the authorities are now forcing, even though they have not been punished for their previous negligence.
Some companies have been processing the results of laboratory tests, which have been associated with drug data, which can provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
Data is increasingly accessible to companies, while monitoring their use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a specific health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to health and insurance providers.
The proposal for a law which gives the authorities the power to control data-providing companies is before Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme in such a way as to bind the transmission of data to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is, the permit in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So the chickens are just a little bit attached to the leaves of goodwill.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are the leading trading partners, this topic has also led to other, mostly global problems, the agenda of the 9th summit.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a growing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator on the issue of support for the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed further at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, President José Manuel Barroso of the European Commission and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade within five years, or increase to more than 100 billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious objective.
Twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally harmonised, so it also received green air transport in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is among the EU's partners in the ninth place.
The summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with respect to terrorism - both sides in all its forms have condemned and called for the speedy convening of the UN conference.
They also orchestrated the end of the Doha trade cycle, although they both have a large share in his previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent.
It was also agreed by India, as was the need for a global agreement and the production of greenhouse gases to be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050 at the climate conference next year.
Both parties would also like to avoid rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is now arriving in the French capital, where a trade on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is about to be concluded at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros will be obtained by French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square meters of a four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand titles to be seen with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the Italian Pavilion's inauguration ceremony: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – 264 square metres of the exhibition area.
There will be a press meeting in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to total Italian production is increasing, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying through the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on a mountain plain at an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, raised doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are confident that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
So the sheriff made it clear that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation Security (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the crash was identified, an investigation team was sent out, which eventually identified the aircraft: it is precisely Bellanc 8kcab, missing since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossette's personal items were found by a couple near their residence in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash money and one jacket.
The search for Fossetta was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, the world flew on a plane without landing.
Among its many records are also flights of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, even with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined determined lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born from the "complex" jeeps of the home of the star, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a faith of news into this sector.
It is thanks to its unusual processing that will be unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the introduction of Suv Glk on the market and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an informal way of communication thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different stages, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin by presenting the car in stereoscopic vision and by means of special glasses to be distributed near Cors Como, you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Eluma8, the new Glk will be illuminated in various moments in all its little things, then reassembled into a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in this advertising into the stereotyped area of car communication.
Will he be able to raise the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Triveneta, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and that has, in fact, never done too much.
She's never even met a fan of the enemy.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Terstu e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-color flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: they removed them on Saturday night so that they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in a name, that is, easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with a running Dasle, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
The four blue fans who had previously trespassed from the stadium were denied a ticket and the game was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then will take action: In this case it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, don't go to any more stadiums.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred and fifty are added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who act this way," Viminal confirms.
So, "strangely open eyes, mainly for a national match Wednesday in Leč."
There's a little support core in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday, Casms, which can count on even one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"Church Leader- Leader and strained arm during Mamel's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way) who is the director of the Vital Observatory for a few weeks (he obtained a place that was formerly Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Terst, where the core of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but, of course, that the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservatorian One adds - crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far, this group has remained within limits, so let's take a good look at what's happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistle at Mamel's anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you'll allow it, it's a misbehaviour."
