By the way, where are you from?
Is that a coincidence?
Coffee, please.
My water broke in the evening hours of the scheduled date.

It's great.
Your wish is my command.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Open your mouth!
The fire spread to the next building before the fire department arrived.
He took off his clothes.
He's an American.
No doubt about it.
She's in a bad mood.

Hands up!
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.

It was just the beginning.
The book's sold.
Welcome back.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Could anything be more romantic?
It's none of our business.
Why do you ask?
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
Dad said no.
Go find something else to do.
You should try one day.
Tom's on the edge of the hedgehog.
Tom reads a lot.
I'm not saying anything.
Please, stop here.
I've been there twice.
Works speak more than words.

You're wrong.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove it?
You disappoint me.
I'm sorry.

Give me another example.

I'm not gonna say anything.
Put the book on the top shelf.
Simplicity is the culmination of refinement.
What's he alive from?
What would I do without you?
You're reckless.
That's new.
Please, have a seat.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
They work together.
I'll probably never use this again.
You're human.
Tom lost his job.
Ladies have a head start.
It's mine. It's not his.
The beauty is in the eye of the observer.
The wind's blowing like crazy.
I'm gonna take the car to town, so I can drop you off on the way.
Why do you need so many shoes?
Maybe they'll need some money.

Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
What did you like most about it along the way?
Tom suggested that Maria go to the doctor.
I have a few gifts.
Over the last few days, I've been doing research on how to make money using a project, but I think all the options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is a tricky thing.
You're my sun.
She divorced her husband.
I changed my mind.
Based on the information I gave you, what story would you go out with?
He's not missing anything.
I miss him.
Tom played the strongest card.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
We're just getting started.
Please, get out of the way.
Will you do that to me?
In my beginning, it's my end.
How would you translate that?
It's almost half past three.

What's that?
He gave up.
I can't wait forever.

Someone called.
Winter is the time of snow.
By what name?
What are you gonna do about Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
Who are you really?
Who waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
I want a sword like this.
Tell her.

Can you speak Latin?
Come back.
Everyone has the right to protect moral and material interests derived from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.

I'm the one who pays.
You're a very beautiful woman.
You're a little liar.
I'm a professor.
Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill you all?
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
Somehow we survived.
It seemed to me Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I've got a cat and a dog, and the cat's black and the dog's white.
Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I just got up.
How does it feel?
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I don't like working.
My French sucks.
We survived somehow.
It stinks.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
Faith can move mountains.
He was two years younger than me.
Here's a picture of her.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I shot a bear.
Not a word.
Sorry, I'm late for the session.
It's 5:00 in the morning in Brazil.
Do you think the situation will improve?
That's not what you learn in school.
Is it clear?
Stop resisting!
I have two colors.
Move!
Are you a maniac?
Well done!
A lot of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
What time do you have breakfast?
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Can I have your dictionary?
I was in a great mood.
Tom's a nerd.
Show me the photos!
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
He's not an American. He's an Englishman.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
His accident taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
Tom is as tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
It was just cream on the cake.
Pick one.
He got what he wanted.
She's drinking like a dick.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
I want you to introduce me to Tom.
After a long consideration, I ended up doing things at random.
You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You let me down.
What's this?
Me, too.
That was very good.
She's taking care of her old mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Go straight.
It's as simple as beans.
It's empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Mary was giggling.
I give up.
I can't sit still.
Happy Christmas!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
I had lunch fast.
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this if I may ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give me an example.
What day is it tomorrow?
Can you set an example?
Tom drinks like a dick.
Is that what you want?
That's not like you.
I can see, and I can't see.
We're close friends.
Tom was completely drunk.
How many people live on Earth?
Let it be.
If I love you, what's it to you?
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
Are you free tonight?
I like to watch you dance.
They replaced coal with oil.
It was snowing.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
I didn't tell him you were here.
It's good to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He's not missing anything.
We live in an atomic age.
Mary makes her living by sewing.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Did you get enough sleep last night?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I'm not doing anything today.
This is Brian Rock.
Two guys ran out of the room.
It's never too late to learn.
We have to find them first.
Tom was very scared.
It's snowing.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom looked a lot different after the haircut.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste words for nothing.
Did you do that on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm a rookie.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or yawn.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
Everything happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see it.
I tried to be kind.
Don't go in there, I'm naked.
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's overburned.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We were peacefully protesting.
Mary was as angry as rice.
Turn left.
Don't cry!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You're under oath.
I wish I knew.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He's known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'll go.
What's all this fuss about?
I don't understand why they're such good friends, they barely have anything in common.
This is a book.
The bedroom's upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you gonna do today?
Taxi's expensive.
Logic is obviously your strong suit.
I'd like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father is so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.

In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know that and I know that. There is not one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, but in advance he would know that it will never appear in the press. I have received my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper that I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks would be out on the street looking for another job. If I had allowed my right opinion to appear in just one issue of the newspapers that I work for, I would have been fired from work in less than 24 hours....
