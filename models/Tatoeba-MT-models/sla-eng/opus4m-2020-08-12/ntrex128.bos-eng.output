Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with the Muppets
Some members of the assembly are dismayed at the proposal to change their title to "members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this could make them the subject of ridicule.
A laborist member of the congregation said his group is concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers of Van Wells: In Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of the House of Political Parties, Plaid, said the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh conservative party said his group is "open" to change its name, but noted that there is a small difference between the terms MWP and Muppetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh word w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary commission currently working on a draft law on the introduction of name changes said: "The final decision on descriptions of the titles of members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh government law gave the Assembly the authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals resulting in strong support for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or of the WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly reportedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could bring headaches to President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Law will also include other amendments to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Commission’s system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last chance to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to referendum on state name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that their northern neighbour's name represents her territory and is persistently opposed to her demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, an opponent of plebiscite's change of title, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that changing the title is a simple price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells on St. Martin are silent as churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today there's neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People hang out differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer a quarter-day residence in which people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property won't last as long as the executives expect, "and sooner or later, he'll go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help preserve the remaining quarter shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the closure of these churches will be accelerated because it is unlikely that the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main trading street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made a recovery plan, they ordered an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
A professor at Tiffany Ng University in Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said the Church of St. Martin had not found him a replacement.
What has been happening in the Church of St. Martin for the past few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been brought by church chiefs and others by the Episcopal Bishop.
The bishop's administration – an administrative body of the diocese, composed of church chiefs – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop would "try to transfer the costs" to the bishop's office, although the bishop's administration was not involved in the hiring of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old during lobster hunting in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on lobster hunting day, officials said.
The attack occurred just seven hours ago at Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy calling for help and then he rowed with the group to him and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was about the excitement of catching lobster, but then "he realized he was yelling 'She bit me!'
She's got me!'
His whole collarbone was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone to come out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Pediatric Hospital of the Council's where his condition is conducted as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told the media that the shark had already been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper hull area.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for a period of 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becoming a competition chain Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to department cosmetic products in the style of shops where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough to the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty market, which is on the rise as sales on fashion and home equipment markets decline, larger cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be extended to more stores next year if they are successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is due to supermarkets finding ways to use the shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwave ovens and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic range by offering more than 3,000 products, including products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr Paw Paw for the first time.
The existing product range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also restart its Boutique makeup line by making most products suitable for vegans – something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the fragrance shop perfume store will test the sales sites in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping on the network and moving towards daily purchase of smaller amounts of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said that stores would increasingly look like stores in the effort of the supermarket to hit back with chains with big discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos department in hundreds of its stores, and also introduced the Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments ended infamous.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended in a dispute over the division of income from pharmacies in their stores.
The new strategy came into force after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its 281 pharmacy to the company Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125m pounds.
It is said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury leather care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores of his assortment.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty department to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an indispensable destination for the beauty market that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "feeling angry" after Holly Willoughby backed out of a £11 million deal
Dragons Dan, Peter Jones, is a "angry" star after Holly Willoughby's television host backed out of a deal with his 11 million-pound personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and extra equipment Truly.
This couple's company is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of this Morning (37) announced her departure through Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons' Dan Peter Jones star by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "rabbit" when a golden television girl admitted, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant there was no more time to devote to their brand of home and extra equipment Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her profit over the next few decades.
Her decision to step down was a shock to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning, which is among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three kids Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as company director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV show.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He joked at the expense of critics he could get from the media over comments he could characterize as "non-presidential" and a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said "reader of news" with his humorous voice.
"I didn't give in at all."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see "adequate response" by the US to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were one step from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now we have great relationships."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - by suspending rocket tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he stepped in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to a crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok is displaced, a state of national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pala, they are still not sure if foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Pala to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no tsunami siren on the island of Pala, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to help earthquake victims is on their way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-standing infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds hit Mr. Joko's administration while the following year is awaiting a new election.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure because of long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced by the street fighting of Christian and Muslim groups using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Footballer Liverpool Daniel Sturridge introduced a deep-seated hit against Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League by shooting at the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1-0.
He transferred the ball to his left, and then he kicked it to the outside.
The ball flew high above the penal area, turning toward the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over Cap Arrizabalga, who was in the jump and fell into the net.
"It was only until positioning, until receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanta coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea ran 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue Attacker added the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the fifth attack before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, bringing Hazard into the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up near the statue by throwing a left foot into the network next to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the group phase of the Champions League at three o'clock on Wednesday at the stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many crowded people were reported in the ruins of buildings that crashed a 7.5-strong earthquake that took place on Friday and lifted the waves high to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the press conference, said.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with ruins.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a thirty-two-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called in people who saw or heard anything nearby.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm inviting everyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on the car control boards, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived on the spot to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing, and police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants were now told that they would have to wait for hours before they were allowed to go back inside.
They heard a policeman tell a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of a crime in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next door.
Most of the cops were inside the police cordon watching the apartment building.
All those with any information are invited to contact directly @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, citing the case 247 of September 30th.
The Cromwell statue in parliament became the latest monument in the middle of a "revision of history" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England carried out in the manner of the Taliban by its Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the Westminster Palace would become a target.
Cromwell did not order, nor did he carry out iconic warfare during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the historical history of the character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps more late nineteenth century than today, to be the protector of parliament from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict from the mid-19th century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of glory and mention."
The murdering pig inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered with blood in a pig market in the town of Lipanshui in the area of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pigfighter was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a pig on May 30th 2005 in the town of Xining in Qinghai, China.
Apparently, he arrived with a cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the next pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's mouth with blood on it.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a male pig of 550 pounds suffered fatal injuries to a farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," said a cousin who introduced himself as Wu, quoted Guiyang Evening News as saying.
The security footage shows Yuan who came to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig attracted a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared it off and drove it away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to showers across northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa's first category hurricane winds reached 85 miles an hour at five o'clock on Sunday's eastern weather, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is formed in the Pacific Ocean and is moving east and west of the United States. As the tropical storm Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain into parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, along with the coming gap, will create widespread Southwest showers in the coming days.
Occasionally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, sediments, and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in precipitation that will reach from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical spread of tropical rain.
On foot trips to the desert would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rains.
The abundant rain in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and the thunderstorms could result in strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming gap will bring local showers to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of over half an inch may be possible, which could cause application and sliding Augustes.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
The rooms scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue all Wednesday.
In October, there may be major temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short intervals.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat remains will try again to accumulate and expand.
At the beginning of October, it will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures ranging from about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a high possibility of temperature above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony before the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political aversion continues, with broadcasters who interrupt the regular broadcast due to Friday's latest plot: an agreement Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a week-long indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he was a hundred percent certain to drink Kavanaugh touched and tried to undress at a high school party.
In passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this probably looked at more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company computed the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channel viewers.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time listing people who are monitoring the transfer from the office.
In order to be better enchanted, it is an audience similar to the one that follows football elimination matches or the award of Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led in front of other networks with an average audience of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second to 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After a moderate Republican's office issued a statement that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters yelling at him after he tried to get into the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He stood staring down for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live feed on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
He was told: "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he had more to say at the commission's hearing.
Cable and television networks were broadcast live hours later, while the judicial commission voted whether to pass Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do it on condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the appointed next week, as called for by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh charges.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times daily.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference of conservative parties in Birmingham, Great Britain, 29 September 2018.
In a second interview next to her on the front page of the journal, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal was that Britain and the EU take customs from one another "very absurd".
Wade Sims' murder: Police arrest Dytheon Sampson, suspected of the death of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dytheon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, police administration Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB network reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wade.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
Eastern Baton Rouge's morgue issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department said the merits belonged to the Louisiana fugitive police task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU club sports director Joe Allev thanked the district law enforcement agency for "the diligence and the desire for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
An attacker 6 feet tall and 6 inches tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU Club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps a match.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "stressed" and "shocked" over Wade's death.
"This is what we keep worrying about," Wade said.
The volcano dumps ashes on Mexico City
The ash that vomits the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay safe after volcanic activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered at 24 hours.
The center was tracking more earthquakes and rumblings.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash covering windshield cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of volcanoes located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protestors, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police force, when thousands of people joined a counter-demonstrations marking the anniversary of the polarising Catalonian referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police squad, threw eggs and paints at them in the dust, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, riots broke out with the police who used pants to contain the fight.
Supporters of independence have spent hours chanting "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" and clashed with supporters of the union who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they sustained in protests, the local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region that set itself aside for independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the turnout was low because opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in violent conflicts across the region.
Groups advocating independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we are in a squalor," he said.
Although they took a key but close victory in the local elections last December, the Catalonian parties in favour of independence had difficulty holding the momentum because some of their most famous leaders were either in self-imposed exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backdrop of democratic values and the repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after being hit several times by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 a.m. in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point a car was shot from a crossbow.
Menge's hit to Livingston has won 1-0 against Rangers.
First goal of Dolly Menge secured a win for Livingstone
Advanced Livingstone surprised the Rangers and recorded only a second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 match clubs from Ibrox.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was tied to the Hibernian in another place.
Gerrard's club did not record any victory in the Premier League guests this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts behind eight points next week.
Earlier, the Rangers will host Rapids from Vienna in a European League match Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended a series of league victories to six matches, and chief coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed a chance against guests who lacked sharpness
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went past the goal, then Alan Lithrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped to get the ball that Craig Halkett had turned his head toward the goal.
The hosts were able to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the guests from free strokes.
And that's how the key goal was scored.
There was a free shot against the Rangers, Livingstone made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who took the ball and shot from the middle of the penalty room.
By that time the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by goalie Ranger Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was kicking too wide out of another free kick for Livingstone.
Crosses constantly arrived in Livingstone's penal area and were constantly defended, while the two pens they were looking for – one after the fouls against Glenn Middleton's replacement player and the other due to the hand game – were not awarded.
"Phenomenal Game" of Livingstone – analysis
BBC reporter, Alasdair Lamont, is in Tony Macaroni Arena.
It's a phenomenal game and Livingstone score.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their style of play and players have almost not changed since their return to the top, but great credits belong to Holt, who has been giving energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellently organized defense, while Menga through the match didn't give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall peace.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard's bat every once in a while, they didn't reach that level.
The final blows were missed – only once they broke through the host lines – and this is a kind of wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at repairing NATO relations among allies.
They differed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU entry.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks out of Turkey lives.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The double protests reflect the division of views about a guest some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others blame him for being an autocratic.
Traffic accident in Deptford: A biker died in a car crash
A biker died in a car crash in London.
There was a collision near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 in British time.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance team intervened, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died in an accident in which the driver left the scene of the accident, on Childers Street, which is about a mile from the site of the Saturday accident.
London police said they were working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
The streets are closed, buses are rerouted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in riots · Global Voices
Six prison officials were injured in high-security riots for men, the Prisons Office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire, on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British time and are still ongoing.
A special squad of Tornado officials has been invited to calm down the riots involving eight guards in one wing of the prison.
Officials have sustained minor facial injuries and assistance has been provided to them on site
A spokesman for the prison administration said: "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident that is under way in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for it and they could be extended prison sentences."
More than 500 prisoners have been placed in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison administrator was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special squad was called to prison because of serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be useful in drought-affected areas)
Rarely do tropical depression affect Arizona, but this is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of next week while Hurricane Rosa with her remaining energy passes through the desert southwest, carrying with her the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her arrival on Monday evening will announce rain.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have retained the status of tropical storm or depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Center for Hurricanes predict 2-4 inches of precipitation, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert south-west, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it is likely to be 1 to 2 inches and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of flooding, Rosa’s rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these rainfalls will probably be beneficial because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the US drought surveillance agency, slightly over 40 per cent of Arizona was hit at least by extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, on his way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a rink on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have 85-mile-an-hour hurricane power Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and that's why it'll start to moan.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico by the force of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at night.
Showers in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a great flood risk.
"The total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baj California to northwestern Sonor, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico by the force of the tropical storm before she reaches Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or her backlogs are the big showers in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the American Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These showers are expected to cause torrential floods that are life-threatening and infuse in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4 a.m. in British time.
He was taken to the hospital and in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are urging those who have any footage of the event on their cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the insubordination and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the insubordination and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "Americans saw the splendor, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most realistic legal minds of our time, a lawyer with excellent achievements in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched on Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke about the importance of the turnout of Republicans in mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claims the Democrats are trying to "resist and disturb".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, said a senior Republican party official for CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of whom were picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves up to six metres (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, taking many to death and destroying everything they were on their way.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the danger of tsunami was released yesterday, people were still engaged in their business on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency, in a speech in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, he carried cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800km per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palo.
Photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake was 200 times the force of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II on Friday.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city on the edge of a long, narrow bay has increased tsunami power, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, sales centers and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of several victims were found under the rubble of demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the threatened areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticised for not reporting that the tsunami struck Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records shared on social networks show a man on the upper floor who panics at the approaching tsunamis on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused the blackout that cut off communication around Palo, making it difficult for the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities have said, but evacuations still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami rose above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision staff must have arrived from Dongala in Pal, where the employees were stationed in tents erected in the office yard, they witnessed sights of destruction on the road, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams started taking the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared."
While the next night falls from the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their shocking story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders in front of Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roe Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Ro Hotel was spread by circles of paragladers he desperately sent whatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26,750 dollars while charging ATMs at the Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, according to a Newport police report, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man came running behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, standing in a statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
All those with any information on their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
After posting a Twitter change on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known under the name of Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the alias Ye and has used the title for its eighth album, released in June.
The change took place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where his new Yandhi album is expected to be promoted.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", the show's author said.
In addition to the shortening of his current professional name, West earlier said that this word had religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with Radio Leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known by the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former associate of West's, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without a dash and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico vowed not to use an army against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would "never use the army to subdue the Mexican people".
The army fired at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in that field, said the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of US authorities issued artificial intelligence announcements, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China published its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the domain of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chance that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersile of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked on an artificial intelligence system that proved to be superior to America's top-ranking Othello player, and later he was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the China branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged earlier US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when the next contests could be identified by future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, that's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired great individuals from the university to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctoral students in the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of the new generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, in the United States, the Department of Defense formed a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Electoral Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that has sought to form the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on state name change
Macedonian citizens voted in Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims their northern neighbour's name represents the birthplace of its territory and vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could jeopardise the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjordje Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the referendum would yield a minimum of 50 per cent, which is needed to make the referendum valid.
The voter's question was, "Are you in favour of NATO-EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be led by the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the title.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when a total of 66% of voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in Macedonia's referendum on change of name, which could pave the way for NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kvardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and drew chairs outside tents that were crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the lifted head, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring over-needed investment in Macedonia, with unemployment rates higher than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'yes' because it is more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the ballots.
He said the result of "for" would be "the confirmation of our future".
A poll published Monday at the Macedonian Institute of Political Research says that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes a 50 percent turnout plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling got rid of Brighton's defense in victory 2-0 Manchester City against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
An Argentine attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he found himself on the open ground.
Aguera then surrounded three green jerseys.
He pushed himself around a defense player, and he was faster than a few more on the edge of the Brighton goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first punch in criminal space to get the ball back to Aguerre, who with a right-handed digger overcame goalie Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the net.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored goal at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers an initial advantage in the Premier League riot.
He scored goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's turf.
He added Leroy Sane beautifully to his left side.
Sanne touched several times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The blue shooter threw the ball into the net before he slipped off the field.
City is fighting Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 on Thursday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the game without competition against Rockys
Since Nationals was eliminated in the elimination match, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the Los Angeles Dodgers advantage in the NL West, are still in the game.
At least the Rockys have a direct pass for winning 5:2 against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win first in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can go out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all the others this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The nationals still need to announce the starting team for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would it be the 34th time he started the game, trained on Thursday, and will throw on Sunday when he usually rests.
The right-hand man from Washington runs 18:7 this season for the average of the well-deserved wounds of 2.53, 300 stacies in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation surrounding the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans leaving the polls for half the term.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the big, big – although I did not run for office I am actually a candidate because everywhere I fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Look at these terrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all possible means, you see evil, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to gain power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resistance and interference".
"And you saw it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, evil and dishonest."
He cited a democratic senator and a member of the Senate's judicial commission, Diane Feinstein, as a name that prompted the audience to resent loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- it was really a bad language of the body -- the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists at my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of laborist members of parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with earlier leaders.
A notice from the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East Friday reads "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local laborist member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not like that and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever happened.
It has become increasingly evident that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I believed to share similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I would never otherwise agree with, whether it is a national security or a single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's accompanied by a flood of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, convictions of the centre's politics, and they tell me I shouldn't be in a labor party.
And it's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a lot of sexist or racist insults every day, but don't retreat.
Something that disappointed me the most in this political age is how these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and by any vote of mistrust or by changing the rules of selection the party narrows down.
I got a lot of advice, and the last two years, they've been pushing me to bend my head, make me less loud, and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, which has caused my primary school classroom to literally collapse, I have sought to advocate better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councilor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will endanger households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not addressed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my electoral unit, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that the threats by removing me from the party or political scheming will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr took a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in the Tennet's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeatable of ten teams.
In the end, the home team won due to superior defense, as well as a larger number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"So far we've been tested in the games and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru, well done, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Naderson's attempt in the 14th minute that Frazier Climo turned, gave Ayr a head start, but it was a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo's penal increased Ayr's leadership just before, just before the half-time, he achieved a solo attempt at a score of 17:5 for Ayr in the half-time.
But Melrose's second half started well and Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out on the stretchers, and Ayr further increased the advantage by the attempts of Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose regained his numerical superiority with Bruce Colvin's unconverted attempt, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to foul climate without the ball. MacPherson reached touch down with the penal line behind the upcoming pier Ayra.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch into criminal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt by the host.
The star of the Still Game series is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the catering industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes a script about and plays along with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series and Kiernan seems to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the daily Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the sea headquarters in La Paz.
Oceanic flags are swirling in public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with a slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our obligation."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory of the shore they lost in Chile's bloodbath over natural resources in the nineteenth century – as well as the longing to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the greatest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects the verdict of the international court of justice on October 1st after five years of counciling.
"Bolivia has caught the brunt, in a spirit of unity and clarity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia and claim that, after decades of cramped negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here is Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year, also plays a major role when it comes to the verdict to be handed down Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The body of the United Nations based in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is handed down only six months after the latest arguments have been heard suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of progressing in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have reversed it.
"The problem of leaving the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold these negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, refused the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "point out 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the issue of leaving the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivar will never give up his right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to understand that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not lift nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during the Singapore summit between the conflicting leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pomped on the border to restart the dead nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree to the declaration until Pyongjang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pyongyang's denial of a nuclear arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim and Trump summit.
The Paris fashion magazines present the latest lines of huge hats that you will soon see on the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the hat collection or completely cover the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of freaky giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer magazines 2019, shadowing everything on the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers on fashion runways showed their impressive creations.
The most prominent Valentine's piece was the over-emphasized hat with a wide feathered rim that swallowed the model's heads.
Among the other huge additions were watermelons with ornamental stones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had our lips wet and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One was like diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other was like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you are lucky.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after "La Bombe", a straw hat with a two-foot rim seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which designed this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent another great creation to the runway – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that wore it.
The extinguisher orange resuscitoire bag with resas and white leather lunch was highlighted in the details of Jacques La Riviera's spring and summer 2019 collection on the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Stilist Luke Armitage said of Faceae: "I expect that the large hats and beach bags will arrive at the stores on time for next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-named fashion accessories."
John Edward: Learning the Language Is Vital to People in the World · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding results in the exams, which is further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide the best level of services to their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare students for further and more education, a chosen career and a place in the society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum and program, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable electoral subject for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it suits his head.
If you talk to him in his language, it pleases him."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the exams this year, we see that the languages at the top of the league tables, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received an A at the high school final exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received an A from Mandarin in high school, while 72 per cent from German students, 69 per cent from French students and 63 per cent from Spanish students also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in programmes of independent schools, and in other places.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for difficulties in filling jobs are precisely the lack of those who know foreign languages.
Thus, knowledge of foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary in order for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in the world of globalisation.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it is a skill for life.
Skills of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks multiple languages ahead of competition.
According to a survey conducted by more than 4,000 Brits in 2013, 75 percent did not speak the other language well enough to have a conversation, while France was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in foreign language learning is important for children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that languages are crucial to the future of the country in the global business environment, so it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced James will play Sunday in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans at six games during the Lakers Preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare myself," he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has started a series of election events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings next week, including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting his vote to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the term because Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
When is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight and how can you look at him on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight in Eastern Time, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's event in West Virginia under a live feed on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearings this week about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which he was tense over sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's expected vote has been postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the preeminent goal of this series of events is to help Republicans achieve a better outcome in the November elections.
Hence, President Trump's campaign said the assemblies this week are being held "to give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is such a crucial part of its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we can as we enter the pre-election campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who refused to present himself, told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to draw the media's attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time this month Trump visited West Virginia, a country in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is not good at polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to raise his ratings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows fighting to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoons may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
A clunk swing is a completely fabricated concept in sports, but one of those in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a swing right now?
"They scored six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points higher, with another twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still believe that they have some wind in their wings, and there are many things that give them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each took three points of possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last punch and he's leading by his example.
The cheers of the celebration grew louder during his round, to eventually play a key blow for the unresolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind two after two.
His final blow to the 15-hole match was met with a similar cry, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to do your best and take care of your match," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with multiple points from Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European couple won all four matches and played without mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit God on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game that they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with the noisy audience have strengthened them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory as the sun sets over the Le Golf National Club.
It would be best for both of us at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebrations.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergio Garcia, the hero of the game with four balls that morning, when he played paired with Alex Norena.
One divine blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they couldn't even get to the end.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to look closely at the interactions between couples, the advice they give and do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great advantage over the final day, but this session of four has also shown that the US team has a desire to fight which some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday matches in the four-ball game and four-ball game it won a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led first with two victories over the moodless Tiger Woods, increasing the result so far at the Le Golf National Club to four points.
Europeans of Thomas Bjorn in the fight to win back the trophy they lost at Hazeltine's golf club two years ago, dominated the impeccable Americans in the morning game with four balls and won a 3-1 series.
The United States has given more resistance to the four-way tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points in 12 single matches Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, named "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second couple in the history of Ryder Cup who won four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they made up and overcame the exhausted Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with an even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, flashed for moments, but now lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson for the fourth tournament and suffered the defeat of 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
However, Europe did not go according to the plan of this pleasant bright day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas' main tournament set a two-point target for Americans on Saturday.
They fought hard to win 2-1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, so that they could later return and defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in Ryder's history, some team came back after four points behind each match, although Fury's defending side is just enough of an unresolved result to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, they do not seem to be able to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says "no talk" about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that extending sanctions deepens her mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the UN annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said that North Korea has taken "significant measures in the past year to demonstrate goodwill", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear sites and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no appropriate US response," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there will be no talk of the first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri repeated the famous complaints of North Korea against Washington's "stepping" approach to denuclearisation that would reward North Korea for its gradual steps, the importance of its statement was that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as it had done before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed calls to ease international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up on 'denuclarisation first of all' and increase the level of pressure on sanctions in order to achieve its goal, even against 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can throw us on our knees is to let go of the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added, "If we had negotiated this denuclearisation problem with South Korea and not the US, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a stateless position."
Yet the tone of Rio's speech differed dramatically from last year's, when at the UN General Assembly, he said that shooting US land with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket launcher" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was much more to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea denuclearises.
On Wednesday Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last for two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strictly and without concession until they are fully, definitively, confirmed denuclearisation".
The Security Council unanimously supported the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to prevent the financing of the programme of nuclear and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompé met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjonjang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey's visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for making "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim told him that "appropriate measures" required the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students sleep more in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning "all night with caffeine".
One scholar observed that the students of the leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course that he believes is the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course came after a speech that held about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my graduate year?'
She said no one ever told her how important the dream is – which surprised me," The Telegraph told him.
This year's course provides students with basics on how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as to improving their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the University Health Service, said the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been observed that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
A one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a student home and students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performances and the importance of pre-sleep routines.
In the second part, participants were told that a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects the decision to smoke cigarettes has," said Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride due to the "waken night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the lack of sleep becoming an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and quality, should be a "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against extra pounds, since the lack of sleep has led the brain to starve, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Cheisler design a course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate his maintenance on the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to pass a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarm on time for sleeping and waking and take care of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressive defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga shot down Steven Gerrard's loose team at 1-0 from Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team took Gerrard as manager only the second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the elusive leaders of the Ladbrokes League Prime Minister, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time, and the uninspired Rangers configuration never came close to equivalency.
While the Rangers now fall sixth, Livingstone climbs third and behind is the Hibernian just because of the goals of the difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to be helped when he was thrown at the side by a case.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr and placed herself in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt chose the same eleven Livingstone players who took a point in the Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team pushed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone made better use of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to score goal only two minutes after Menga first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to allan mcGregor's goal, but the midfield player missed a big chance and shot next to the goal.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow only managed to kick by the goal, end of the statute.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should've got the pen at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but the former goalie of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem defending Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and tamed the shot that Ovie Ejarius directed.
Although Livingstone's first goal in 34 minutes may not have reflected the true relationship of strength during the game, no one can argue that he was deserved, if not for anything else, then for the effort he made.
The Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' deep free kick again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the wingman hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly came running from his line and blocked it.
Livingstone, however, continued to encourage guests to play exactly as they liked, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held up well and defended Jacobs' attack, so that Lithgow would send the ball from the corner by the goal.
A replacement Ranger player, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game was looking for another pen when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter · Global Voices
And now, the station from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882 today 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become more known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the main strongholds of science, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 Bell of Coronado, where seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, quite a crack!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure involves removing immunological cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory
They can thus see a protein that is common in many types of cancers, and then they are injected again.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who has received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immunological cells from the patient, converting them into a laboratory so that they can "see" the HER2 protein and inject them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth of several types of cancers" including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" the same way to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a strong speech of support to Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was surveyed during the Saturday Night Live show after a proud performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, that night, during which he wore a hat marked "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
"So many times I've talked to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
The SNL launched a sketch in which Matt Damon played and in which a Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission regarding allegations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West by posting the video.
West also complained to the audience that it was hard behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They teased me!
And then they say I fell," Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that he would "put on Superman's cloak because that means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were visibly ashamed, Variety said, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio has been completely silent."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose ex-partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many by performing a song and hunting it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not retreating in front of the villains."
But Karen Hunt, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "what he truly is and that it's absolutely beautiful."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) for whom I believe he embraced and expanded an ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, a rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying it was now "to be previously known by the name of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to "artist previously known as Prince".

Star of the series "Games of the Throne", Kit Harrington condemned toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats the sword in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO Series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) fell down on the stereotype of macho heroes, saying such roles on the screen means that boys often feel that they need to be rough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in the time of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married a partner in Leslie Rose's 31st Game of Thrones, admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with the problem.
"I am personally concerned at the moment with the question – what did we do wrong with presenting Virility?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic macho culture due to the portrayal of characters portrayed as men.
He continued: "What is born, and what is raised?
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of man's behavior?
I think that's actually one of the main questions of our age -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the pre-adventures or sequels of the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer, saying he had "completed with battlefields and horses".
Kit's been playing Sam Shepard True West theater since November, talking about the movie producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he believed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that had happened in the Game of Thrones series.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this fantastic show that won the Emmy Award.
A couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, a change from the previous situation.
Usually in the past, HIV spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT is widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff leaked information about the Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US Ambassador Maxine Waters denied that one of her staff published the personal data of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those legislators.
The L.A. Democratic MP claims that these claims are posted by experts and the website of the "ultradesonic wing".
"Lesses, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
A conservative web site such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publication was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon sparked a conviction on the Internet, also made by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial exudes anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament needed for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't be impertinent.
He can't question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer clearly compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrat, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who has run to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"Big thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the responsible competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false allegations".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that before the law they answer for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Johnny English movie review back in action – a milk spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also apply to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedies about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to the screens in 2011 with the sequel "Johnny English: reborn".
Will the ironic autosatization of how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, the dimwitted, incompetent Johnny English rubber face got a new chance to screw something up – with his name more than anything giving up that it was a general comical creation designed for the territory with a cinema audience whose English is not the native language.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a little Mister Bean, and a little bit of that guy who played only one note in the thematic tune of the performance of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It is also originally based on a traveler and an international man wrapped in the veil of secrecy that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest is an undertaking are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval chivalry armor and when the rotor knives briefly rattled on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way redundant, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission confidently add comic elements.
It's an impression that humor is for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventures aren't as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent-movie-style gags in Mr. Bean's image.
Now it's a very topical topic that Britain is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of agents on duty -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for a prime minister, a pompous and distraught character who's already experiencing a complete collapse due to a fall in political popularity: Emma Thomson has maestroically played this character modeled on Theresa May, but the scenario is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the sly Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some fancy institution, but informally holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting goghs when English holds a spy academy in the fashion of the film "The School of Rock".
English is quickly returning to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to be reassembled with a former extremely patient partner, Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to the commander of a submarine in whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are again at the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and the happiness of the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the vicious Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their episode of comical events: disguised as waiters, burned down an elegant French restaurant, real chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht and English launches a real anarchy trying to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house using headphones for virtual reality.
It's obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into that last sequence, but no matter how cute and cheerful, the whole movie is like it's made for kids.
It's a pretty mediocre quality.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry can come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan by which the British would work four days a week, but they were paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to pass on time to workers that they save thanks to the AI revolution by assigning them another day off.
Employees would enjoy the three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "be integrated" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The move to a four-day working week was approved by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to economic rebalancing in favour of workers, as well as a party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "beautiful directors" and "profit" in utilities.
The opposition's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not recover their entire investments because labourers could impose "declarations" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include company board workers and create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10% of the value of private sector companies to employees who are expected to collect annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy's talking about "60 minutes" about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and has withdrawn the question of whether an investigation by the bureau could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unmistakable."
But Senator Graham's voice seems to be sealed.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a strong accusation would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it energetically," Graham added, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she appoints can't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Citizens of the World Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the great Central Park lawn who will not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group seeking to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, a telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the Citizens of the World project with only 12 years left to achieve their goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another form of so-called "clictivism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world have claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have advocated a number of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and policies worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements from their shares, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already directly affected 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, a partnership of investors and realists from Great Britain who have promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", vowing that Rwanda will allocate $35m to stop at the end of malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make social malnutrition become a historical footnote," said Ambassador Power of Food, Tracey Ullman, live in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their website that says, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world answers: "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and stumble.
However, like all major civil rights and apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – the Secretary of the Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinka, US Interior Secretary, has discovered and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – namely, they are there at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to resolve the issue.
"The United States has the opportunity to, together with our navy, ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to those present at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia consists more or less in the use and replacement of fuel," he said, saying Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after Trump's administration's mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which represents a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project North Stream 2, which would make Berlin "container" of Moscow, according to Trump.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, needs to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of selecting suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. state provoked a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously think" about the 2020 presidential bid, state senator Masachusetts said
State Senator Masachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, transmitting the source The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city council, saying he is "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called in for criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of Thursday's poll showed that the majority of the electoral body that voted for Warren does not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The poll showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential and 48 per cent against the candidacy.
Other sound names in the order of Democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSD Track Palina at Donald Trump's support meeting.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence following Monday night's incident
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can connect with what is happening to other families suffering the effects of PTSD and the vulnerability with which our soldiers are returning," an audience told President Donald Trump in the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma, at a rally of support.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, she added "they are returning a little differently, returning stronger, returning wondering if there is respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the army have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence -- assault on a woman, obstruction of family violence and possession of weapons under the influence of opiates, according to what Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasilla Police Administration, said.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the re-examination of a new US policy that shortens asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to the court to support asylum seekers who challenge this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against the federal police, has not been revealed.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She's been detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled the 2014 Immigration Appeals Committee's decision to allow non-documented immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and that in this way the chamber violates that principle," the friendly report states.
Lawyers further claim in the report that the police, which prevents immigrants from entering, are causing harm to the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "guarantee the necessary workforce".
State prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases in June that they no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"A asylum is only available to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or particular social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June about politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palo while the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"It is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the desolate city of Pal.
‘Emergency assistance shall be provided every minute to import the bodies.
The government of the needy is pure water."
The residents are returning to their demolished homes, going through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees are overcrowded.
Some of those injured as Dwi Harris with a broken back and shoulder are located outside the Palou Military Hospital, where patients are provided outside assistance due to continuous severe side effects.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells of a powerful earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was hit by the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of committing "violence with propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the paid addition of China Daily to Des Moines Register, the state's most sold newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections to be held on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections indicates that US officials have told Reuters a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to press China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where each other is increasing import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed at exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and the former longtime mayor of Iowa, who is China's main exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles the violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting a valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom, posting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the kiosk located down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's problematic economic path, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under a strong Chinese Communist Party stick," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not mention the newspaper.
Republicans keep women from voting before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of prominent Republicans who defend and stand next to Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially in women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue are very intense and most Republicans are already showing that they want to give their vote.
There is no going back in these things," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said in a magazine article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute request for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during demonstrations in the Senate Hall, while Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to persevere with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," Stu Rotenberg, an impartial political analyst, told news.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among the undecided women's voters in the suburbs and among the younger voters between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony made details of the alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts were of the opinion that there could be negative reactions if Republicans persisted in the appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, broadcasts the NBC News network.
"It is not just the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with the issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities Group, said of the information channel, which supports the election of Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided as to who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with a slight inclination toward Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said they felt the same way about Ford.
Following the Flake initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least another person who made the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez reportedly claims that a candidate for a Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals while attending a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, launches a startup aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, whose creator Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that Inrupt's intention was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said, speaking of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or PO (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data store on the network is that it entirely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides sources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM security platform, a number of development engineers employed to work on the project and community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to bring about a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
On Saturday's release on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptova "is a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Foundations for Web and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria’s cross assigned to the priest in World War I
Celebrations in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was awarded Victoria's cross as a fighter in World War I were celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won a confession on September 29th 1918 for attacking the cities of Bellenglisa and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won Britain’s largest military confession.
At a parade held in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered the memorial board.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog and under heavy gunfire from the battlefield and a machine gun".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and led the platoon forward with the “greatest heroism ” before, with no help, he rushed onto the Polish cannon and tore down three of the troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was executed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never reach, but something that causes humility."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, got Pepo Pig instead
Imagine that, you've stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually prevent you from watching the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and appeared live during the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Moussas and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, viewers in the United Kingdom remained appalled when the transmission interrupted Pep Prussia.
Many were not at all impressed that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning precisely because of the struggle.
One Twitter fan described this stopover with a cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is a government regulation which states that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, on the issue of transmission.
"The Pepa Pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I talk about replaying, I think we can probably solve it," Coker said.
"But the transmission is there at six o'clock Sunday morning and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a breakup, they were circulating correspondence and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that. It was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become successful.
A 24-year-old said it wasn't until high school that he realized that "they're not all like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that represented Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
A regular program host, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of her illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others during growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferior value and the feeling that I am different were the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
A double winner of the bronze Olympic medals has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he thought he was happy to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said falling in love with a man, US producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "surprised him."
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who's 20 years older than him, and said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young," he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parent of Robert Ray Black-Daley's boy in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the 40th year after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I simply knew that what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song - the flow of Heather Small - which echoed in it as he prepared for the Olympics and from which he was still passed by by the specks.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summertime.
Mickelson van form on the bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he'll play his 47th game on Ryder Cup, but he'll have to get back in shape so this won't be a joyous turning point.
Mickelson, who plays the Biennial for the 12th time, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench in Saturday's four-ball games and four-ball games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and improving the range of the game, hoping to correct what bothered him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not the ideal choice for the challenging terrain of Le Golf National, where a long uneven terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their matches this week on the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes in himself very much.
He's a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it went, and we thought that was how it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence brought some immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than a regiment of games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a game in Valderram City in 1997, when a party whose captain was Seva Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a narrow difference of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You constantly remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," Bjorn said, conceived after watching the team 2018, which won the 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going all the way tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and that's what's left of the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm targeting 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Thrilled by the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this carry me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
There are individual games to be played tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're testing yourself as a golfer.
It's a message you have to convey to the players - give it your best shot tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those big turns the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "the miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with such a rush, it creates a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've formed our cast accordingly, and we've prepared the boys so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and facing Rory McIllroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think it can cover up to the end," Bjorn said about choosing players for singles.
New German warship waiting again
The new German Navy frigate was to be launched in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not arrive for at least another year due to system malfunctions and emergency costs, local media reported.
The release into service of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, a leading ship in the class of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by the military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four ships from the Baden-Wuertemberg class that were ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, it will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to have the latest frigates scheduled up to two years without returning to the home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which should have allowed Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time they begin to use, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate arrived in the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media has cited a number of key "software and hardware shortages" that would render the ship useless if it were deployed to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were of particular importance because Baden-Wuertemberg ships will be operated by crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who managed the old frigates of the Bremen class.
Also, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy to reduce its impact and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including training staff, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy is in fact "out of ships that can be deployed".
The official said that this problem has grown over time, because old ships have been shut down and no replacement ships have been purchased.
He complained that none of the frigates in Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study conducted on a farm in the hills of Scotland aims to discover that bats use the landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study led by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will follow ordinary bats and the type of soprano, as well as brown long-eared bats and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
The special recording device will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
A professional analysis of the recordings of all records will determine the frequency of calls made by bats and what they do by what species.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show what habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help to establish the use of work on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and which is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and UK declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which has a negative impact on beds and habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, as well as house cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of the country throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who perform regular checks, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even founded the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good habitats.
But there is still so much unknown about bats, so what we do here and on other land will help us to understand better what they need to advance."
He stresses how important it is to check that the bats are on the property, since it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother’s bed kills up to 400 females and young people, likely to result in the extermination of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and the law prohibits killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how the population of most of our species develops. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has charged him with rape as "false news," saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has released the charges.
An attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid her $375.000 to cover up this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, who are 142 million in a video on Instagram Live, hours after the indictment reports, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports by calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the camera's five-time gold ball winner said.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "inmaterial damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents delivered to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "a 99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
According to the files, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and that they photographed her injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old says she is now seeking annulment because she is still traumatised by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will regret forever losing car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that what Toyota UK said to the BBC -- if Britain left the EU without an agreement that it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the delay at the border in case Bexit loses the deal could cause job losses.
The plant from Burnaston, manufactured by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, voiced fear about how cross-border trade would work if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what car manufacturers call the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on the principle of "right on time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a break at the border that could lead to delays and shortages of parts according to industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for longer than one day at its factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to achieve the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy our current success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 at BBC said in today's programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what was an extremely successful supply chain."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the Union Union union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when such jobs close, they never return.
The government spokesman said: "We must make a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight over the candidate for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court continues, they said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby jeopardize Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been a topic of talk in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was also talking about the sound to record talks with Trump and the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein threw away these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House, amidst rumors of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI Friday to investigate the Kavanaugh indictment for a week, thus delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this has not yet been established, it could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week, considering all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders has not held a brief address for journalists in the White House since September 10th.
The manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short addresses was not due to the aversion to "theatral behavior" of TV journalists, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be strengthened.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without citing evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Brief speeches will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this as much as possible, and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the assembled press unrestrainedly and occasionally strangely.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU employees in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about concerns related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express the state's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeanne Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's EU withdrawal.
The Scottish government has already pledged to offset the costs of the EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue during the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this has been a very restless time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and more broadly, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Team Defense Player State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing an emergency operation after he injured his head on Saturday's 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the stretcher and took it to a further test.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no details of the type/volume of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red jersey, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five overall downs on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 downhills in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher fee to buy real estate in the UK
Customers from foreign countries will be charged higher taxes when buying property in the UK, with additional funds being used to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Foreign customers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This step will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
Higher fees will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money to strengthen the government's intention to fight outdoor sleep.
An additional fee, which was introduced two years ago in addition to the existing fee, including several levels, on the second property and purchase for rent, could amount to up to 3%.
The vault expects the move to increase revenue to 120m pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not have a residence in the UK, which is why prices are rising, and first-time buyers are becoming more difficult to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the taxi to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping high real estate prices by buying land they didn't use first, and asked Mrs May to give up the quotas for affordable houses as soon as possible to break the British "disgusting housing policy".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including control of rental and suspension of any of the assignments caused.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime minister's mandate to bringing back the British dream -- that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as valuable British.
The dream of owning the house has become too far for many people, and the inhuman sleep in the open still is still real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end-of-the-line ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scots enjoys the challenge of returning to the Northeast club, which currently ranks third in the First League, with three points less than the lead.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B-team and that was it," Ross told the Sportssound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel upset because he comes after so many big names in such a big club, after refusing to offer the Barnesley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this time will be 'will I be able to return this club to the Premier League?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Prime Minister of the League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I can only be considered successful if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross is only in his third year of managerial career, after a period he spent as assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15 months as part of Hart's coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren dragged from the low-league edge to the next season's champions.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," Alloa recalled.
"I honestly believed management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management, and now I'm doing it, in all my adult life I haven't felt more comfortable than I am now."
You can listen to the entire interview on the Sportsaund show on Sunday, September 30th on the Scottish Radio from 12.00 to 13.00 British summer time
The perfect time for a glass is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the traffic of British pubs struggling to survive, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars sales grew by 2.7% in July, but sales in restaurants dropped by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting company, who collected data, said: “A permanent sunny time and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup contributed to a similar pattern as the previous month in June, when pubs grew 2.8% and restaurants had an even greater decline.
The drop in traffic in restaurants of 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
pubs and liquor-focused bars have achieved far the best result with more growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than the drop in traffic in restaurants.
The food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month, with a decline in food sales by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the RSM Agency for Fun Content Analysis and Hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
Weather opportunities and the impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the fall of sales of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for caterers focused on food, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting slower introduction of new brands.

Every fifth child, some of whom are just 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from his parents and teachers, discovers research
A study involving over 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" warrant that shows parents
Every fifth child, who is only 11 years old, makes orders on social networks that he hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in “false Insta” orders, referring to the Instagram photo sharing page.
That news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "principal" order to show their parents, but they also have private orders.
A mother who came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who called out to others with the words "rape me."
A study by the organisation Digital consciousness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools revealed that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private orders.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: It disturbs the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice of athlete" on the Scottish Athletic Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as an ineligible director at the annual assembly of that governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade
"Eilidh enjoys the great respect of the athletic community in Scotland, UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including 200m and 400m in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and now a regular BBC expert, remained immobile after having experienced a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time could tell if I would recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers to cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that manufactures traitors has shared opinions on the Internet with advertising that breastfeeds compared to cows of the muse.
In order to mark the launch of the product described as "the first silent traitor", the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertisement inspired by an amusing music video showing the freedom that the new pump gives to milk producing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between a haystack and a cow with a song that reads, "Yes, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a wiener, it's my breasts."
Next comes the chorus: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself."
However, an advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different viewer reactions, while many said it sheds light on the "disgusting" milk industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they must become pregnant and give birth as we do to produce milk, but their babies are kidnapped a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's delivery pump discreetly stops in the breast-fed bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It’s clearly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a mother-teller who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “Advertise without any sense. ”
Others stood up for the commercial, and one woman admitted that her song was "crazy".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy this if I was still breast-feeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a ridiculous advertisement directed at mothers who produce milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows. ”
This isn't a commercial that praises or places the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced all with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely insensitive, there is no wire or tube and stops in the breastplate, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out as they give milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “Pumpa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves bold and provocative launch.
By drawing the parallel between the breastfed and the milk cow, we wanted to focus on giving milk and all the challenges that go along with it, reflecting in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump's made headlines.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Marta Jakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find a guardian for children.
Traditionally, most of the guardians themselves were migrants without documents that were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by coming forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult household members would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not previously been convicted.
"Nearly 80% of the persons who are either guardians or members of the guardian's household are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're going to continue the search for these people, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, said the workers at the shelter.
Many will report a video call instead of a personal one, to request the immigration judge's legal status.
Those found not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain closed, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts at escape, the more prominent the workers of the shelters and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions like the one in Tornillo, where due to size it is much easier to overlook signs that indicate that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good - bye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian country, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "the war against terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the holy fight until we eradicate all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly in charge of training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed "one Western country" for "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an end-of-war agreement.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Accord has warded off a major attack by Syrian forces supporting Russia in a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would "be exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of authorities and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem presented the requirements of the Syrian government for participation in the committee's work, saying the work of the body should be limited to "considering members of the current constitution" and cautioning about the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, to what many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and the scandal earlier suspend his mandate.
That would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of the presidential term of all time!"
So far there's no indication of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the credit rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN channel and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the shock zone, compared to four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC has exceeded its cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the night with breaking news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the drama "Elected Survivors" on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book “Just Funny Parts: And Some Raw Truths About Getting Into a Club of Hollywood Boys, ” has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
"He said: "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scwell told me.
Chaos also has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law in Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to unite and what the state of the global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that for six hours you were watching a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward was using sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear," about Paul Manafort's jacket from his $15,000 worth of ostrich skin (a suit with a thick display of haughtiness," wrote Washington Post) and the implications of graphic descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"A part of what he makes you think of him as a reality show is that he feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "The pawnshop", commenting on the rotation of the acting figure and the daily complications of Trump's show (criticing the American football league, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleissa this week, outside his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 °C), but he closed himself inside and watched MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big inflows of money on the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the same race.
A recent break in the district's borders in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who headed the second district after the early elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
Tickets were re-painted after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign financing fight between the main party fundraisers, the Committee raising funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a wide-ranging special election for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania in March.
The position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for China's support, but then withdrawing.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a hearty meeting with President Panamanian Juan Carlos Varel and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement earlier in the month.
But the penalties are only considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with a high unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was supposed to be the continuation of a similar last year's summit that represented a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and had actually suspended any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing you know, it could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump obstruction of the judiciary, which is now an important evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller has also focused his investigation on uncovering the possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's attack on the elections.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he's preparing to re-enter the voters, and perhaps in front of the jury.
There's a lot of "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are like him, is inevitable.
All of us must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans now face multiple such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unsuspecting position since this paper reported last year that he proposed secretly recording the president and suggested that he was not suitable for the performance of his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for the Congress that Mr Trump will call to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're gonna fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with the cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapidu from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians, after an impressive tie in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify as a member of the G Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the connective player Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until an unsolved match with Villareal with a final result of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old player said.
"We came into the game believing that we could achieve something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to take them all the way, but all in all, the unresolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we are expected again to have a great European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, although, with the support of the audience, we can certainly win and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries until the changes in the club itself, but now we're happy with what we have right now.
The team's in good shape and the boys are really enjoying it; we're training well.
I hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep worrying about pension savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few of them discussed this with members of their families.
About half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said that they had talked to their spouses about the costs of long - term care.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on the subject," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Cooperate with your counselor and family and consider where and how it will be made available to you, since such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care funding elections may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Take care of your legal documents: Prevent legal battles from taking root.
Make a decision on medical care in order to have an authorized person of trust who will supervise the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also concluding a financial authority agreement.
This implies choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is taken to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."

The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials said, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
As communications broke out, aid workers could not obtain any information from the province of Dongala, a region north of Palu, closer to the 7.5 - degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palou after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches more than 300 km (180 km) along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are based on the economy of Central Sulawesi, and especially the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Moravaly, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit with tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh at northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, triggering tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai Island, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing demolition and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died in the demolition of buildings.
2018.: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of having committed domestic violence, obstructed the reporting of domestic violence and resisted arrest, according to a report published Saturday by the National Police Agency of Alaska.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's detention unit and a $500 bail was set for him, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he stated on the issue of pleas of guilt that he was “certainly not guilty, ” the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he's facing a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by a prison sentence of $2,000 a day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of family violence and possession of alcoholized weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after bringing her son into contact with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a break in connections and electricity supply, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake's epicenter was right next to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There's videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment for a federal crime in the country that hasn't been committed since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle trail along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he shot down pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to a death penalty application filed in the southern district of New York.
At both points, it is possible to pass the death penalty, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saip with 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of murder and racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnic," the punishment request said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of being released for admission of guilt," Patton said.
Saip's defense has previously asked the prosecution not to pass the death penalty.
The conservative MP says that Nigel Farage should be in charge of the talks on Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel dissatisfaction" with the Eurosceptic, as one of the MEPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
conservative representative Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "come out" so far if Mr Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in trying to unify her deeply divided ranks was stressed by conservatives who advocated staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks by both supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and "the chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting to go to Solihull that he wanted to "refuse Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel the Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
A supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: "I am just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please dismiss the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message to Mrs May, she added: "Premiers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the group that politicians must make themselves "feel dissatisfied" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "you won't get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of being betrayed by Brexit, to feel dissatisfaction.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governmentd, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved "Toryevci v. Brexito" banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus" plan, for an uninterrupted state at the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren's planning on seriously considering running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts was talking about her future during a participative meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elected for the November elections against the Republican representative at the Geoff Diehl House of Representatives, which was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's at the centre of speculation so she can face Trump 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Hollyoke was her 36th meeting with electors on which the participatory format of the meeting has been used since Trump took office.
One of the attendings asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in charge."
Arresting after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday the arrest of a shooting suspect who killed a basketball player, LSU Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at the 11:00 press conference.
A video footage of the shooting was released Friday, asking for help finding the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head as a result of his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson hit him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of the weapon, and that he shot Wayne Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge County.
Junior of 6-foot-6 who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season with 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits and 2.9 jumps per match.
Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after order provides him with victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtery Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to boxing first and left Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel from the wheel which had reluctantly forced Ferrari driver to leave the free interior at the risk of lagging behind after a double move in defense of the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race by relying on his tires to get to the quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got into the boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day since Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve one or two formational finishes," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad speech from the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinsten at a rally Saturday for insisting that she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were evil, mean and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the announcements and the information that leaked to the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public-whatever?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it out."
Well, hold on a second.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- however, Feinsten denied that information had been leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story to the public." Feinstein told the board, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who commented at a rally Saturday night: let me tell you, it was really a bad speech from the body.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use these allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see malice, malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday by winning 5 to 3 in a rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
In the beginning, the Giants gained the advantage of two goals of Patrick Dwayne and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equation before Dwyer regained the lead of Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened out for Dundee before two of Lucas Lunald Nielsen's goals ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the season of the Elta League for the team of Adam Keef, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of both sides, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwayne opened the match in the fourth minute, 3:35, with Kendall McFaulle's assistance, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilleier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a rush at the beginning, Sullivan returned his home team to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquard assisted Cownie in equalizing at 15:16 minutes.
By the first break, Dwyer had provided the lead of Giants with a second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again brought them to an equalization in measuring the forces naked at 27:37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles unitedly helped Nielsen bring Dundee into the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored fifth goal in the middle of the final period to ensure his team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four since the previous five matches, welcome Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died, ensuring safe takeoff of a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died, and many have disappeared since a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
Although his colleagues fled trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Yufri Palu Airport that rocked hard.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was standing on the runway at the time.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He died later in the hospital.
spokesperson Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our heart is breaking because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state's disaster relief agency states that access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is believed to continue to grow as many bodies remain under the rubble and many cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached a height of up to six meters ravaged the Pala in which a mass burial will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Emergency vehicles every minute import bodies.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small stores are looting everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is busy working to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the military of that country: I ask all of you to work all day to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that after a plane crash in a lagoon, one face is missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said that one person was missing, after it had previously announced that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they have been unable to track the passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline states that in collaboration with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they are working to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to queries for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy have announced that the plane ended up in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get to the emergency exit through the water that was cutting through their waists on a plane that was sinking.
He said the crew was panicking and yelling, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair the docks also helped save the boat by inflating passengers before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in the accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed the case Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he was using cell phone data to compile an image of the movement of the defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said the location information was obtained from several phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier allegations, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford, testifying Saturday, said he wasn't in town that day.
Asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett is that Tellis erased her messages, calls, and contact information after Chamber's death from his phone.
He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin on Sunday with the final word.
The judge said he expects the trial before the jury to take place later in the day.
What's an enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to challenge the negative attitude towards this genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and return the popularity of a conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fuguees and the Commons are once again gaining popularity in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
New York's nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after she received a text message from her mother complaining that she was another black person."
A couple deny they're racist, judging the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she realized that Giselle Maurice, the new nurse of the children, was black.
NEE Another Black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly and was expecting a Filipino instead, broadcasts the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a fee for one day's work and was sent home.
Maurice is now suing a couple for damages for dismissal, as well as a $350-a-day fee for six months, on which she is originally engaged to live with her family, although without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said on Friday for the Post, adding that I know it's discrimination."
On charges of racism, the couple returned that the cancellation of Maurice’s engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they insulted her, they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco told Post Husband.
But would you trust your children with someone you have offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Qualifying the lawsuit as an extortion," Plasco said his wife only received two months of maternity leave and was in a very difficult situation."
You're gonna chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the public court was quick to judge couples on social networks, criticizing them for such behaviour and thinking.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: It is difficult to put herself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a book for children, would work for the BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work were rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with both happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, who she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like your child was achieving something and you're proud of him, even though it's not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the product of his imagination, he always credited all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
Over called regularly to say it was bad, and they did not expect to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and they no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before that, and it all went out.
All I could do was sit around and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be collected."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now in mourning of her daughter's death, boarded a plane with other passengers, who never dreamed of the pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I bent my head, and my tears flowed all the way down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieved women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to stop others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge are putting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective cook with a contagious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would radiate every room."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I keep worrying that it will leave consequences."
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know there was someone you could talk to and someone you could talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit there and keep quiet - talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
He did not say he was moody, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom. When the children opened their gifts he did not look them in the eye or anything else."
She says that his death to them was a great trauma, but that they must overcome it: It leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's tearing us apart.
But we'll keep going and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for - an investigation of a limited duration and scope - it might somehow unite us," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart" because of the intransigence of party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is caused by the choice of moments.
The congressional elections are held in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if the Republicans go bad, their attempts to win the country's highest court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators on Saturday, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
It will vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling on data from the South Korean UN Office, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 refugees were registered last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs that smugglers charge.
Pyongyang didn't make any public calls.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have improved noticeably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, which reached a broad agreement that he would work on denuclearising the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
Without confidence in the US there is no confidence in our national security either, and in such circumstances it is not possible that we first unilaterally disarm ourselves," the RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives has called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh hysterical" and said he was unworthy of service in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that a woman would ever be called hysterical if she ever did," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and grumbling when he spoke of his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, assessing the allegations against him by grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" organised by the liberals to be angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform his office in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias at the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if they would try to call Kavanaugh off if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi resigned.
I will say the following - if he does not speak the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only similar to being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of the District Columbia District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible judgments against the Access Health Protection Act or in the Roe v Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would alter certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be brought to court and that we are expected to say whether it is wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justifiable anger, anger that's been gathering for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I was greatly helped by a woman who was the executive director, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that made her understand that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed a way to eliminate anger in part and because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from earlier work, in the office where most of the men were in, was that when I once cried over an indescribable rage, an older woman -- a cold boss who I always feared -- grabbed my neck and pulled me up the stairs.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad they think they shot you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Hart was caught in an out-of- wedlock affair on a Monkey Business ship in 1987 and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason not to consider the idea of herself running for president.
That was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me through her laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already far away, it was lagging behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only 250 dollars.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so consumed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger at the chauvinism -- which she was sorely engrosssed in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Cleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my monument?
She cried?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonages of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and while the end of the battle is not yet seen, the strife between countries in the long term can benefit Beijing, said experts.
Donald Trump, US President, fired his first warning early this year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest blow occurred this week with new tariffs that hit $200 billion (150 billion pounds) items, taxing virtually half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has returned the same amount each time, and the latest introduction of tariffs from five to ten percent on US goods is worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond in the same way, and the second largest world economy appears not to stop soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means meeting demands, but public worship to the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, US pressure in the trade war can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for a steep economic downturn in one of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready" to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a war-torn country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore a normal life.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had aided the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the United States with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, struck the ball in the water with an initial blow on the 16th hole of pair 3, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shaved in all rounds, and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started in this format in 1997.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Trobjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 from Ian Poulter in England who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of the tournament of all time with winning 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy. I'm very happy that we won the Cup again.
Here is an important team and I am glad that I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He's handing over the relay to his countryman, John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now he's holding a career record of 13-21-3 on Ryder's Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 of the greatest titles and only stands behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team spent the whole weekend trying to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were playing top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were times this morning when we gave Europe resistance.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our board of Ryder Cups, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
