Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “be like Muppets ”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are contrasted with the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Congregation members across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One member for the Labour Party said that his group fears that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member for Plaid said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said that his group was approaching a change in the name “with an open mind, ” but noted that MWP had a close touch with Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter “w” is expressed in the same way as the letter “u” in Yorkshire.
The Commission said to the assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce changes in the title: “The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves.”
The Law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given the option of calling the Welsh Parliament meeting.
With regard to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the version of MWP received the greatest support in the public debate.
The members of the assembly are obviously proposing alternative options, but the fight for consensus can be of concern to President Elin Jones, who is to present a draft legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the proposal for a committee system.
The members of the assembly will vote on the issue of their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on country name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will change to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
Any vote should resolve tens of years of ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a right in Greek territory and has repeatedly protested against requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to plebiscite for changing his name, said he would not vote.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that changing the name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silent because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
"The old people I spoke with say that there was a bar and church on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today there's neither."
The disappearance of bars is understandable to him.
"People meet in a different way today," he says.
"Barry is no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
As far as churches are concerned, money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started. ”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of these types of people who don't help the remaining saints in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and that's why soon the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move in will become members of churches."
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose piety took place not far from here.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was in the lead of a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in July called her "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first bell player in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger bell game in a church in Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders has been played at St. Martin's, some of which have been called by laymen of the church, others by episcopal diocese.
The Council of Elders, a governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives, sent a letter in July to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese would "try to pay costs" to the council of elders, although it did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who dived for lobsters
According to the official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy who dived for lobsters in California on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he and his group were sailing to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he considered the call to be a joy from the lobster hunt first, but then “you realized that he was shouting ‘ Bite me!
He bit me!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that “he had a torn entire area of the key bone. ”
“I shouted that everyone should go out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’ Hammel adds.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego.
There's no telling what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles at the press conference said that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
For the sake of investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains with cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialized salesmen will be available.
In a strong market for cosmetics in the United Kingdom, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and domestic needs are falling, streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores all over the country. In case of success it will then expand to other shops next year.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the effort of supermarkets to find use for the racks used previously for television, microwaves and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's reports that it will double the size of cosmetic products to 3,000 products and will first include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
More space will also get the existing range from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees branded places similar to Boots.
The supermarket also reiterates its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the first such shop was opened in Croydon in southern London last week and will be created in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local shops means that supermarkets need to work harder to attract people.
Director General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will look more and more like business houses because the supermarket chain is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount salesmen like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of shops in Argos branch and also established a number of sections of Habitat, which are the chains that he bought two years ago. This increased the sales of food and the acquisitions are thus even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to remake the department with cosmetic and pharmaceutical sorting ended infamous.
At the beginning of the millennium Sainsbury’s joint venture with Boots was tested, but the connection ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the sale of medicines in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold its 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds to the company Celesio, which owns the chain of Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds is scheduled to play his part by adding to four stores an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury with Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the appearance and style of the streets with cosmetics in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our brand range should satisfy all the needs and appealing environments and the advantageous position means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "angered" after Holly Willoughby stepped down for £11 million
Star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones "feels" after television moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from the $11 million contract with his life-style brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventy-year-old moderator announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to information sources, Jones “feeled angry” when a TV star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of the new contracts — up to £1.5 million — would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of domestic clothing and accessories of Trula.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of moderator Willoughby at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, a 17 - year - old, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his summer residences.
The unnamed source states: “The Truly badge was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would provide her with a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was absolutely shocking.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was happening, the launch was so close.
The mall in Marlowe is full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of this Morning, which belongs to the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to the wholesale investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes and possible further delay in the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three kids Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged two and a half, joined as chairman of the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replace Anto McPartlin in moderate the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Difficult Meetings “Then We Fell in Love ”
He joked about the criticism he would get from the press for a comment that some consider to be “inconvenient to the president ” and for speaking positively of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “vote ” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump appreciated as a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons are stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a prominent North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea of the United States did not see a "responsive response" to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have yielded positive results – the cessation of rocket tests, the relief of hostages, and the return of the rest of American soldiers to the country.
And he was defending his unorthodox approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 outside people trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that there was no need.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were evicted from their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit demanding," said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children organization is bringing together a team that is travelling to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work here.
Mr Sutupo, the National Disaster Agency's spokesman, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations will be able to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although shelters were built against tsunamis in Aceh, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning in Paul against tsunamis probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though a warning was issued.
Even at the best of times, travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the site of the new calamite.
Improving the bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Vidodo's election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he'll be working again on the election, but his government is narrowing down funding shortfalls.
President Yoko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and have driven tens of thousands of people out of their homes.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool fired a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters outside Chelsea Gate when his team lost 1-0.
He switched the ball to the left and fired it at the remote pole.
The shot flew high and headed for the right upper corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped the jumping Kepa Arrivabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible.” said Sturridge server LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come near me, so I didn't think much about it and fired one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
Attacker Blues sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then in the middle of the field he turned around and printed it halfway to Liverpool.
The blacksmith hit the ball fast.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard's beautiful alley into the lime.
He escaped from the defense and left to a distant pole next to Alison Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15:00 Liverpool in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, competes with the local team.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 3 p.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
Number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Bureau reported on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and tsunami waves rose to 832.
The 7.5-degree earthquake hit Friday, triggered waves of up to 6 metres high and trapped many people in wrecked buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at a press conference.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was visited by ruins of collapsed buildings.
The police arrested a two-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A woman 44 years of age with stab wounds was found at 7.55 p.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street on suspicion of murder and was arrested by a 32-year-old man.
Police have called on people around here who have seen or heard anything to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: “The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to everyone who has moved near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, in particular taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,"
The police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman was living in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the crime scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police have reported that an investigation is under way and are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't able to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take hours for them to return home.
One man was told by a policeman that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans behind the tape, and the others were waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information may send a message to @MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit over an argument about "rewriting history"
His exile would have been a deserved punishment for the fact that his fanatic Puritan followers in the Taliban style had destroyed many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "insanity" and "the effort to rewrite history."
Society president John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure would become one of the goals in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent creation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century view and part of the history of the character that many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell to be something less than the end of the 19th century, a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unwavering historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century created the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His success as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and reminding."
The killing pig tore up a Chinese farmer
According to local media, there was an attack and killing of a farmer by a pig on the market in southeastern China.
As the journal South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the name “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near the mud market in Liu-phan-shui in the province of Kui-chou.
The pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs on 30 May 2005 in the Chinese province of Ching-chai.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he and his cousin from the neighbouring province of Jün-nan came to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next barn was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the barn with blood on it.
According to the forensics, it was confirmed that a 250 kilos of farmed pig had tore up.
"The cousin had his legs all bloody and torn," the journal Guiyang Evening News quoted a cousin as saying by his last name "Wu".
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so no one else could think of it when the police were collecting evidence at the crime scene.
Market representatives allegedly deal with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, the pig lured the Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove him away by the farmer’s wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a “starter”.
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken and move above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the days ahead, however, flooding rains will be brought to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. east time Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean forms a low-pressure ridge and moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baia California peninsula on Monday, it will be shaped like a tropical storm and will push tropical moisture northward to the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity then with the approaching low-pressure ridge in the coming days will trigger a heavy rain in the southwest of the United States.
The precipitation of 25 to 100 mm will locally cause dangerous floods, streams of rain and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially over the majority of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In the event of rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, floods may occur.
Because of the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and storms will bring local winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure ridge will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the southern coast of California.
There may be total precipitation above 13 mm, which could cause smaller suture currents and sliding carts.
It will be the first rainfall in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, isolated tropical overcrowds will begin to approach Arizona and on Monday evening and on Tuesday, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the United States because the Arctic is beginning to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today, they will once again try to spread the fragrant summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and in the east of the United States, a warm beginning is expected to take place in October with temperatures around 27 °C from the southern plans to the north-east of the United States.
In New York City, Tuesday could be 27 °C, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows the high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation was followed by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched six television channels on Thursday's binding announcement by a candidate to the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued, and voters interrupted the usual programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: an agreement brokered by the senator for Arizona Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Christine Ford told the Senate the court that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching her at a high school drunk party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen were watching the event.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations, which reported such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of viewers who watch football games in playoffs or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest lasted even after the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN cameras and CBS caught on Friday morning how protestors shouted at him when he was going to take the elevator to the trial panel.
CNN broadcast live as he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes and got his hopes up.
One woman said: “I’m standing right here in front of you. ”
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee's meeting.
All cables and television networks later broadcast live when the judicial commission was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote on the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI within the next week, which required a minority of the Democrats.
Flakea was partially persuaded by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "politicians"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicians" regarding Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called plan from Chequers when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose their duties is "unreasonably pointless".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dytheon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
The authorities released a video of a confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and according to the Sims police, he lost his glasses in the game.
According to the WABF channel under the CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson confessed to shooting Wayne.
According to the defense attorney, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department thanks the police unit for the state of Louisiana refugees, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police for "the drinking and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the match.
The basketball coach, LSU Will Wade, said Friday morning that Wade's death “shocked” and “shocked” him with a team.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
The volcano creaks ashes at Mexico City
The ashes, which fall from the volcano Popacatepetl, hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcanic activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of storms and earthquakes.
On social networks, images of frontal glass cars covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital city. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors faced the order police for independence and thousands of people took part in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence divided by Catalonia.
Orderly officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them.
Later, fighting broke out, and the police had to use the earrings to calm them down.
In a few hours, groups supporting independence sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of the protestors of the Union who called "Let Spain Live".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
The year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate, remains tense in the region seeking independence still high.
Voters spoke out of the vast majority for independence, but participation in the elections was low because the opposition to the withdrawal boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes throughout the region tried to end the vote in the polls.
The groups supporting independence stayed out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration took place, she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-eight-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said he was no longer looking forward to gaining independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, even though the close victory in the regional elections last December by the Catalan parties supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves or are awaiting trial for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old monteur Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said the conflict was being fanned by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament.
"The candidature in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after a car crash into the house
Three men 33, 34, and 39 years of age were imprisoned after being repeatedly attacked by a car in a London Derry house.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone shot the car.
Mengo's shot provided Livingstone with a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone guaranteed a victory
Livingstone, who graduated from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won this season in the Premiership League on the guest field, and next Sunday they will face the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League.
Livingstone has extended a number of matches without defeat in the division to six games, so chief coach Holt, who last month replaced Kenny Miller, hasn't yet had his defeat.
Livingstone against indistinguishable guests did not take the chance
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his directness caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke in on the defense, but failed in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow slipped just right past Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
Housewives had enough to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was ordered a free kick and Livingstone created a scullery, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Menga, who ball in the middle of the penal territory flowing and scoring.
At this stage the Rangers dominated the ball, but the home defense for them was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly didn't have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by goalie Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow failed to hit him from another standard situation in Livingstone.
Centers were constantly flying into Livingstone's penal territory, which the players kept cleaning, and two penalt kicks came in, following Halkett's attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
‘Phenomén’ from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Awesome performance and result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have almost changed since returning to the peak, but Holt deserves great praise for how the team has since his arrival stirred up.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, led a perfectly organized defense, while Menga was keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerard, but they don't meet those standards anymore.
Their end was lame – only once they entered the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of a table.
Erdogan welcomed a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and all smiles.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of topics, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey is in this city.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
There were also hundreds of people, many of whom were Kurds, who were protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
Controversy reflects the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
An accident in Deptford: A cyclist died after a car collision
A cyclist died in London after a car crash.
There was an accident at about 10:15 local time near the Bestwood Street intersection with the busy Evelyn Street street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead on the spot.
Only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday’s tragedy on Childers Street, the driver left the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said that the police are now trying to identify and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses take alternate routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in a male prison with high guard.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and continue.
To cope with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialized overseers from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
The speaker of the prison service said: “As a result of the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, prisoners were specially trained.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison director ended up after an attack by a prison in the hospital.
And last October, order units were called to the prison for serious riots in which the staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the dry area can thrive)
It is not customary for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low-pressure ridge, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and carries the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning against floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service on Twitter stated that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have kept their tropical storm status within 320 km of Phoenix or below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict precipitation from 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Belt, it is likely to fall from 25 to 50 mm, with local ranges up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious matter, these precipitations may help somewhere, because the Southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, the weather.com server experiences more than 40% of Arizona at least “extreme drought”, which is the second highest category.
The journey of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still at the speed of the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and so it will lose its strength.
Mexico is expected to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which presents a high risk of flooding.
“A total of 75 to 150 mm are expected in the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonor, with up to 250 mm,” states the weather.com server.
Rosa then resembles a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and arrives at Arizona border on Tuesday morning. Then she passes Arizona and enters South Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe contractions in Baja California, Northwest Sonore and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in the upper terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, and his condition is now “stable. ”
As police reported in Avon and Somerset, young men between 17 and 20 years of age were detained in the Radstock area at night.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on the cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “taste the wickedness and rage” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a party in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh had “taste the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, where he firmly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's complaint that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that “the American witnesses were of Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage. ”
A representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that “the vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service. ”
The president directly ran into Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it was for the Republicans to take part in the election in the middle of the term of office.
"Five weeks ago, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump announced that the Democrats have decided to "resist and obstruct".
The management adviser of the Republican Party told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the floor of the Senate was expected by Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of casualties is still increasing
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, had been hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which were littered by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people met at a beach in Palu. At dusk, however, the coast was hit by up to six-meter waves, which killed many people and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami wave was preceded by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued to work on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they fell for the victim," said the spokesman of the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at Jakarta.
"The wave of tsunamis did not go alone, took with it cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said and added that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the flood and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The aerial photographs published by the Disaster Relief Agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water-encircled mosque.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday as well.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released by Friday's severe shocks was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the wave of tsunamis.
Nugrogo described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found bewitched under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the amount of casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in an area called Donggal, which is close to the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication was “completely protected without any information” from Donggala.
In his statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the area and added that his workers and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
"It is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The Agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform Palu that a wave of tsunami struck the tsunami, even though the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
On amateur recordings shared on social media, a man on the higher floor of the building with a desperate scream warns people on the street against approaching tsunamis.
Within minutes, the water wall that carries buildings and cars will hit the coastline.
Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a major power outage, which disrupted communication in the vicinity of Palu, so the authorities could hardly coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision staff from Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where employees were hiding in cello shelters built in the courtyard of the office building, they saw the images of destruction on the way, says Mr Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began their sad work of disaster relief, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
Under Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may begin to flow to the post of calamite only when the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," says the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arriani.
“When the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, friends and relatives of those still absent still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that ease the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists at the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr Gendon described how, in the hours that followed after the Paragliding Community learned about the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperate to send messages through WhatsApp to the Palu contestant who attended the beach festival.
But instead of two blue checkouts, his message ended with a grey mark.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took 26,750 USD during the addition of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press report from the Newport Police Department, the thief was estranged Friday morning by 26,750 USD to Brink's employee in addition to an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money into it.
When he did, another man “went from behind the employees of Brink” and stole a bag of money to be deposited in an ATM.
Witnesses, according to the press report, saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information on the identity of the suspects, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “A being formally known as Kanye West. ”
A forty-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, she replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for “sensitivity reasons, ” according to the creator of the show.
West said earlier that the word for him has a religious significance, in addition to shortening the existing professional name.
"In my opinion, the "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where "you" means," West was allowed to hear about his album earlier this year when he was talking about his album with the Big Boy radio moderator.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
The name has also changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
A former associate of West's JAY-Z also alternately wrote his name with the connector and without it and in large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody attack against the students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Oberador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
At a time when the left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people in a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and by opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education dragged young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to an investor and expert in the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the US government have published the AI announcements, even though the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year, according to which it wants to be the number one in the Innovation AI by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the area of AI would be made in the USA.
Lee, who published his book “SuperVolutions AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University University in the 1980s he worked on the AI system, which defeated the best American player in Othello, and later he was the head of Microsoft research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee appreciated previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when he would be next to help identify new visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, according to Lee.
"Academies are not driven by China, but by corporations," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee of the United States.
"In my opinion, PhD holders in the field of AI should automatically be offered green cards," he says.
The National Council of China issued a plan for the development of the new generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations are giving money to researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence this year to involve partners from the sector and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of a selection committee for artificial intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Of course, the US legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, hasn't done anything in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
Macedonian people voted Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which is blocking applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a right in its territory and therefore served as a fan of Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott raised doubts as to whether the required 50 per cent of voters would be delivered to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was, "Are you up for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, electoral participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally gave up their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko give their votes in the Macedonian referendum on changing the name that would open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not with our servants' doors," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%, with so much investment needed.
"I think a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result of "yes" would, he said, be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station revealed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first major blow to the policy of the Western government since its arrival last May.
Look, Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for a goal through all of Brighton's defenses.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling settled Brighton's defense on Saturday, thus securing Manchester City win 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguerre's administration, his goal looked ridiculously easy in 65 minutes.
It all started with the pitch that the Argentine invader got in the middle of the field.
He printed out among the three Brighton defenders and made it into open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penitentiary territory, one defender passed, and several others ran ahead.
Then he found Sterling on the left.
The English attacker nailed the ball back to Aguerre, who took the right hand over Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalie with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” the news manager City Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky he scored that moment."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was provided by Sterling.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote pole.
The attacker Sky Blues threw the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffmanheim in the League of Masters group at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs fight, there were not many reasons to reenact.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the place of a pitcher in the Colorado Rockies game Sunday – but only when they have the hope of playing-off in the NL West.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card Friday night with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
"Even if we don't play anything, we can at least throw away because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I will experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but is reportedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start.
Washington's right hand pitcher has statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump performed at a meeting in West Virginia
The President spoke indirectly about the situation surrounding his candidate in the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
It is one of the big, big – I do not run, but we are still on the move and everywhere I fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the ugliness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overwhelm to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resist and obstruct".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, and said, "Democrats are "angry and evil and repulsive and lying."
He mentioned, on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to the loud noise of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, wait -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a variety of opinions.
He is intolerant of those who express their views
When the moment activists on my local side voted in favour of my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to whom they said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way, because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, as regards national security, as regards Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday's Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years I was a local member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings have not been held today, and the promise of “a kinder, kinder” policy has long been forgotten if it ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour side and that every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, whom I previously thought we had similar political opinions, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stand positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it was the EU's national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then there's a tirade of harassment on social networks where they call for my appeal, condemn Wednesday's policy and tell me that I shouldn't be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the tide of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the diverse opinion current, and with each proposal to express mistrust or change the rules of choice, the party is becoming more limited.
In the last two years, I have been told many times to hold back, not to call back, and then to “be all right. ”
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who let my general school class literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilman or as a minister of government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with existing leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would only say that if the country is penetrating towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr rises to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved in this wonderfully entertaining match Tennett's Premiership triumph.
Now they're headed by tables, like the only non-beating.
In the end, it was an excellent defence and a better use of the chances that helped the household to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have been through great trials in our matches and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All honor to Ayru, they took a better chance than we did. ”
Five Grant Andersons in 14 minutes, transformed by Frazier Clime, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbers, and Jason Baggot got an unaltered five.
Climo increased Ayru's lead with a penalt, and then he scored and changed his solo attempt exactly half-time, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on the stretchers, and when it started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to five Stafford McDowall who transformed Climo.
Representing Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card and Melrose used the player again thanks to an unaltered five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
However, the housewives returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking the climate without the ball, MacPherson put the ball in the penalt order behind the passing Maul Ayru.
Climo turned, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught the kick of David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five domestics.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the hospitality industry, and it turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 60-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that he writes and plays along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next ninth series would be the last series of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of the newspaper Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the “prosperous business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the La Paz naval headquarters, which is decorated with rope.
Above public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described in the slogan: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to get it."
In all of Inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost in the wake of Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to relive the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations may be greatest in a few decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling that should fall on October 1st after five years of negotiation.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD decision on large screens throughout the country with the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile is obliged to act on Bolivia's sovereign approach to the sea.
The charismatic native President of Bolivia Eva Morales – who has a controversial battle for re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia – and even if it did, much would not change.
This United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to direct any Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the MSD decision only comes only six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case was “not complicated”, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, not only did they not support the Bolivia thing, but they may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been strengthened by the existing Bolivian government," says Zarate.
He adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all of Chile's remaining good will.
Bolivia and Chile will once again take action, but after that it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries haven't changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia a “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of conflict with each other’s advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the U.S. can believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never arm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to make the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that stuck at a dead end for more than three months for Singapore meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “planning of hope” that the ongoing sanctions and the US's opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful about agreeing to the declaration if Phongjang does not take significant steps to disarm first.
Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pchjongjang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that your fashion shops are about to come up with the latest trend of huge headgear
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of smashed huge head coverings for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a show that caught everyone at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling feathers that flooded the heads of models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated melons, witch hats and even pineapples – but they are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled diving equipment with a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a corn with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could even reach fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come for "La Bomba", a half-meter-wide straw worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the exhibition mall – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that carries it.
The dark orange Rafi bag laminated with reef shakes and white leather handles was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/summer 2019 collection from Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to F EMAIL: “I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in fashion stores next summer – given that the designer has had such great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a number of academic successes, and it continues with other excellent test results in 2018. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only undermine this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and sought to ensure their pupils and parents the best possible level of services.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individualised school curricula, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it goes right into his head.
If you speak his own language, it goes right to his heart."
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are the top of the boards, with the highest level of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best mark A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like subjects that students choose are as valued as the subjects of STEM (sciences, technologies, technical fields and mathematics) in the study plans of independent and other schools.
The survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons that employers claim to be problems in filling vacancies, 17% of the language skills are insufficient.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he learns another language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he has such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks more languages automatically benefits from competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, among 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent were unable to speak the foreign language well enough to engage in conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school differs from the language it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have in independent schools a choice from several languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are essential to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should, in fact, be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will introduce himself in the Lakers uniform for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers will soon be here.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening game of the pre-seasons in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is only likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-seasonal games," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign performances tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five matinees scheduled for next week, including friendly stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a vacancy in the highest court, Trump seeks support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the term, as the Republicans stand in the November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern time today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's estate in West Virginia can be watched online through live feeds on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about hearing a candidate at Brett Kavanaugh's highest court this week, which was very tense about the charges of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed for a week before the FBI's investigation.
But the main goal of this wave of estates is to help the Republicans pick up the pace before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organisers President Trump said that these five meetings next week are "to add energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Controlling the Senate is so important to its agenda that the President will take this busy campaign season to as many countries as possible," Reuters spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, which he did not wish to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could come to the Wesbanco Arena today and watch it from Pittsburgh.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to help him with his research," says Reuters Politologist at the University of West Virginia Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown that his stomach is to fight to keep his hopes up before Sunday single
After three unilateral games, Saturday couples can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really trust him, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the swing going now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we take it so that the pendulum is probably moving a little bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, leads by four points and there are twelve remaining.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in the sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and everyone can boast three points of four.
Spieth was deadly on the transition from the firing range to the green, and he's following an example.
Celebrity screams further increased in the continuation of his bike when he managed the key path to win the whole game when he and Thomas were two holes behind.
His path, which won them a 15-hole game, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left behind.
18 pits for leaving a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but lovely couples from Europe are four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The process and the way the energy flows both towards a violent audience and from it confirms that these are players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sundown over Le Golf National will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time on a different hole.
However, speaking of European glory, they remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked briefly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
The pit and the two trunks on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in the abyss from which they no longer climbed.
But none of them will help you on Sunday.
The games of two doubles on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give themselves, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team, and until the last day, it has taken a significant turn, but this game of two also showed that the US team has a stomach for fighting, which some, particularly from the states, doubted.
To the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe by 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup, then from Saturday's two-ball games, it came out with a head start of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly almost twice won the match over Tiger Woods, decided to make the Le Golf National Four Cuts.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated the morning games to two balls with the American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but couldn't get into deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend received the nickname "Molliwood", are only the second couple to win four points from their four opening matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game on two balls and then slightly defeated the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who lasted two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in a two-ball game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game on two balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson in a double game on 2–1 defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the ones and threes in the world ladder.
Europe, however, did not have this pleasant, fresh day south-west of Paris on the line.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas pulled two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and came back later to defeat the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a double game, even though the first two holes lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-game, although as defending Fury's side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says that “no way” will be unilaterally and without trust
Foreign Minister North Korea said on Saturday that the continued UN sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had adopted “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see an appropriate response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to unilaterally disarm itself."
While Ri reiterated the famous North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a “progressive” approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step of the way, his statement appeared to be significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation only because it had already been done in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pjjongjang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on “denuclarisation first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force their goals and even oppose “declaration of the end of the war”, Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea and not the US were to be a party to this issue of denuclearisation, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have taken place.”
However, Riho's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN general assembly that the focus of the North Korean missiles on the US territory was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump designated Kim as a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump, which threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work must be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Promotion of sanctions by the Security Council must continue with a strong and unstoppable attitude until we are aware of full, final, verified denuclearisation"
The Security Council has unanimously supported the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN general meeting, and Pompeo announced that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and announced that progress had been made only to announce that North Korea had made “gangster demands” within a few hours.
This month, North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile complex and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim had announced to him that the “appropriate measures” he hoped were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year forced all its students to sleep more, and this in an effort to fight growing macho culture studies throughout the night when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital believed to be the first of its kind in the USA.
He was inspired to start a course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this just now, in my last year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The course presented for the first time this year explains basic information to students about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall comfort.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to start a course after finding that the students were really sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another part, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as well as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "studenting all night" still exists, he added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is also growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so that it does not occur to collect, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into a hunger mode, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design a course last year, which during his first year at Harvard, received one of his classes.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that may trigger your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's hit determined Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
Page Ibrox tried to record her first victory from February 4th to February 1st at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes ago and the Rangers' composition seemed uninspiring and determined to settle.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone climbs to third and right behind the team of the Hibernian as opposed to one goal.
And there could be further problems with the Rangers after being treated with head injury by a liner named Calum Spence after apparently being hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which pushed around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took point Hearts last week and would be happy how his well-trained men choked their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingstone did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after the beginning when Menga first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backup buried his big chance.
The distant free dig of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt like he should have a quarter-hour penile when he and Steven Lawless got in a fight, but Judge Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots at the target in the first half, but the former goalie Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and the gentle shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener may have been against the running of the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they've earned it for the day.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action on the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate results when the wing broke into Morelos, but impressive Kelly was struggling from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingstone continued to involve visitors in the game of exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metaled one long ball after the other.
Holt's party could have deepened its momentum in the final stages, but McGregor was well placed to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late sentence when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned around again.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger’s Readers
And now the page from our "Sunday Morning" album: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and it is still coming... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter became a constant of pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in the main role of these seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader, which is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive activity in minerals.
Evans: "Oh, yeah, now he's really scratching it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers, and then the thread is injected again
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has been missing ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can “see” a common protein in many cancers called HER2 and then re-apply to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said, "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were collected from patients and “teached” them to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West took part in the pro-trump sermon, in his maga hat, after his performance at the SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was published in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance during which he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again hat, he started swimming on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and say, ‘How can you like Trump? He is a racist?’
If I'd bothered with racism, I wouldn't be in America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead, in which a Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee about a complaint of rape against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, footage of West's theatre speech was recorded on social media by a comedian named Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had been given his headpiece to eat in the backstage.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
It's chicana!
They also said I was in the wrong place," Washington Examiner said.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that he “put on his Superman suit because that means you can’t say what to do.” Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were earned only by the noise of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked worse, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said: “The whole studio has been completely quiet. ”
West was invited as a late replacement for a singer named Ariana Grande whose ex-boyfriend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest characters: THANK YOU THAT SES SET THE DAV. ”
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter said that West “was simply who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing. ”
“But I DON’T WANT to reward anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”) that I believe represents and transmits to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game Thrones Star Kit Harrington launched into toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, came out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be hard to earn respect.
The newspaper The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that “something was wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The whale, who recently married his star Star to the throne of Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that it was “very strong ” to this problem.
"At the moment I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened to the masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenage men about the problem that we now see here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is inborn and what is taught?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, they grow the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have his own side?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do I change it?
Because young men certainly have changed for the worse.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Games about the thrones after the finale of the series, because he already has enough “fights and horses”.
Since November Kit will be playing in the restored Right West Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting with his current wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne Game.
“I met my wife when she was filming the show, so he gave me my future family and my next life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Kit's love character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series awarded by Emma.
A couple got married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by this virus.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who infected HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health care professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 annually.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would have avoided the data of the GOP senators, the term “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theory” is being overturned.
On Saturday, US Ambassador Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican American senators to the legislative quizzes.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were supported by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"A lie, a lie and other defiant lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information issued reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
There was a leak after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is the source of the contributions, is linked to the Waters office and published information about the members of Waters staff, Hill says.
"This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including the former White House White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the temper to be a member of Congress."
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't resist.
He can't question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and not be disturbed."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and authorities involved in criminal proceedings about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again affects reviews – weaker espionage parody Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be a case of this resurgence of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this insolent satire be on the subject of how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this ostentatious, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to mess things up again in a completely new way - that name more than anything else by signaling that a broad comedy is meant for a non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the blunt secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a speck of Mr Bean and a large piece of that guy who sang the only tune in the sound of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
The post is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV ads Barclaycard, and who left behind chaos.
In this last edition of THE JE is found one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor were short-circuited about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exhibited, but humor feels quite subdimensive and strangely superior, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy trampolines are as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's face.
The current assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field to intimidate an agent in the service - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the prime minister who is a pompous and engrossed figure who is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political incompetence: Emma Thompson likes this Theresa May character to play as best, but there is not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once each of her active spies is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director in some luxury facility, is also teaching a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice gags here, because English offers a spy academy similar to Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency napkin and met with his long-suffering partner Bough, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the head of the submarine, an affected character who may even lose a little bit of talent with Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in a pack of tasks for Her Majesty's Secret Service, meeting with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously exposed to the magic of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the notorious Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their odyssey full of fragrant palates: masking as waiters will set the French restaurant on fire; creating chaos when they sneak onto the deck of Volt's luxury yachts; and English will trigger a clean anarchy when they try to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
I'm sure all the essays are ready for this last sequence, but as kind and stormy as she is, she's got some kids' TV in her.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to hand over savings to workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would have enjoyed a one-time weekend - but they'd still be taking the same reward.
The source claims that this idea would be “suitable” to the economic agenda of the party and plans to favour the country for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A longtime laborer stated to the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that falls within the party's position to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspirations are not currently approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party’s speaker said: “The four-day working week is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account. ”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell declared that he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "experts" in utility companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share, as the Labour Government could make “decreases” on the basis of perceived guilt.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of companies and to set up own-ownership funds that transfer 10 % of private-owned enterprises to employees entitled to pay annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the show "60 Minutes", whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could have changed their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, and raises the question whether the findings of the office could move any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unmistakable."
However , Graham’ s decision is undisturbed .
"I have already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh, and that would mean a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she appointed could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission at the end of world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in its seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to be able to get a free ticket to the event (if you were unwilling to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing the world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before reaching his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert really in a way that is to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clicktivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or leaving a tweet will make a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by his supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the global leaders' announcement of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and implementers who have committed themselves to "help children grow to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help them finish their food supply in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition,” the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 events that called on U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on our website with a question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard way — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among those who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman this year.
The US could use the Navy for a "block" that would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke argued that Russia's engagement in Syria - particularly where the legitimate government is invited - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity to use our navy to make sure that the sea routes are open and blocked, where necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organised by the consumer energy alliance, which is a nonprofit group, which in the US is referred to as "the voice of the energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach and dealings with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuel," he said and at the same time refers to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the “dissuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin “an hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is to double the existing capacity of electricity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's largest industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "look closely" at the presidential candidacy in 2020, says a senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the election in the mid-election period, she would “closely look” at the presidential runoff.
During a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top women's position," The Hill said.
"After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the presidential candidacy."
During the session, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction”.
"I'm afraid to the bone of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open to her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a Thursday poll showed that most Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable” voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the bid.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% for the candidacy and 48% against it.
Other high-ranking democratic names referred to in the context of the potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make a decision officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina for a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may be related to other families that feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with," the audience said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that “they are returning a little bit, they are returning, they are returning, and they are asking if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen and any other member of the army are giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic assault on a woman, assaulting a report on domestic violence and holding a gun intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal call for new measures by the US government, which vampires asylum on victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the county issued a short report Friday to support and challenge asylum seekers, the NBC said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal politics in August, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang ” had abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the US reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal for Migrants in 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measure “ignors the decade of state, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” said a short friend.
Lawyers further argued briefly that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants is damaging the US economy and that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "add the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"A asylum is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion," the Sessions said in a statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has doubled, are racing in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, who comforted her feverish boy in the evacuation center in the empty city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance will bring in more bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through dreary things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were crippled.
Some injuries, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a spinal and shoulder fracture, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside for continued severe subsequent concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he reflected the feeling that the violent earthquake shook hotel rooms on the fifth floor, sharing peace with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
US Ambassador Blams China for "Sacred" Propaganda Advertise
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily, which focused on the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday about the paid supplement China Daily in Des Moines - the state of the biggest sales newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections indicated what US officials said that Reuters was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to introduce commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, which is at the level of mutual imports.
The Chinese legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican side, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor Iowa, a prominent exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bully by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American valuable tradition of free speech and free printing by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic path, given that the media belongs to China's Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers refused to publish ” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their polls before the election because of the Kavanaugh debacle, warn analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming polls they would learn the response, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most of the republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute trying to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm down the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and speaker of the Progressive MovementOn Group, told the D.C.
On Friday morning the protestors chanted “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the Senate Hall, where the Republicans in charge of the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, said Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break the record," said Stu Rotenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's true."
But it could be higher, especially between women's swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her charges of sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed it, resistance might follow.
"It was a confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it is also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of US priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in their opinion of who to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sympathy for the second named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh for sure or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flaké, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh was attacked by a drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet and run ahead of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What is exceptional about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The aim of the Inrupt project is, according to the CEO of John Bruce, to bring resources, processes and corresponding skills to help the Solid platform be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project cooperated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his article on the media published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy who received the Victorian Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place hundreds of years since the only spiritual Church of England won Victoria’s Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandkids discovered a memorial stone to him at a party in Rushden on Saturday.
One of his great - grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “genially symbolic ” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and a strong shooting of cannons and machine guns."
Later he reached the first line and with “the highest courage” he led the line forward before self - hurling himself into the firing field and knocking out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something humiliating. ”
Together with their brother, Dr. James Vann, after a concert led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band youth group, they laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he “felt great honor in being able to participate in the show, ” adding that“ the courage of a true hero is shown by the support of many. ”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of getting Peppa's pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the stupid Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The bill from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's game, viewers in Great Britain remained amazed when the news turned into a show about Peppa's pig.
Some remained unexcited after watching the game until early in the morning.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in the show for children as "a form of a bad joke."
"The government regulation does not make such content appropriate at 6 a.m. and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President for marketing and communication to Bellator after he was asked for this transmission.
"Pepp's Pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would work on the program so that audiences in the UK would be involved in the future.
"I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock Sunday morning and we can't do it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were very friendly.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We reduce it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried our best to keep the promise given to the fans and failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “less valuable” because of sexuality
The Olympic jump into the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everything because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to go for success.
A 24-year-old athlete said that he did not realize that “not everyone is like him until he got to high school. ”
On the first disc, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, said that he spoke aloud about gay rights to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his ability to become a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of Kirsty Young's long-term show had several months off because of her illness.
Daley, who appeared as a caregiver in Laverne’s first program, said that he felt “less valuable” than anyone else who grew up with him, because “you didn’t find it socially unacceptable to like boys and girls. ”
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and dissimilarity were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone, ” he said, not to disappoint anyone who might find out what his sexuality was.
A double holder of the bronze Olympic medal became a fighter for the rights of the LGBT movement with a high profile and used his presence on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had responded because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope. ”
This triple world champion said that falling in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "has caught an unprepared one."
Daley, the owner of Oscar, who's 20 years older, took last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar rises and falls.
A couple in June adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that "the whole angle of his eyes changed".
"If you asked me last year, it would all be like "I want to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father wasn't worried about dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and got the bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed about it my whole life – jumping in front of our home people at the Olympics, I don’t know the feeling better,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – Power from Heather Small – which was resonating with him at the beginning of the Olympics and was still causing goose skin in him.
The show Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, on Saturday at Ryder Cup, ended up on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson would have achieved a record on Sunday when he played 47, Ryder Cup, but he would have to adjust his form to prevent the unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played the event every two years on the double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday fourballs and foursomes to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was often the case in the United States, he spent five times the main winner of his day alternately between cheerleaders and the work of the game in line, which he hoped would correct what troubled him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so it is not the ideal choice for a narrow Le Golf National playground, where a long-membered terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course isn't self-concerning enough, Mickelson is facing the exact British Open Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week on his new Tommy Fleetwood team.
If the Americans, who had less than four points, launched 12 separate swords, escaped the rapid onset, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and gave him nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, patted me on the back, gave me his hand around his shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"So much he believes.
He is a member of the Chamber of Fame, and in the past and this week he has been so useful to these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine him playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record in most of the West Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 loses and seven draw, even though Furyk says his presence to the team has yielded some tangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun when they went to see him this week, which was fun to observe.
Gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a large lead heading towards singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily change into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted at the game in 1997 in Valderram, where a team led by Captain Seva Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they reached the finish line with a very close victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You must always remember that we had a big head start in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only closely," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it wasn't behind us.
Tomorrow you'll be bored.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with the way his players played in a complex golf course, added: “I could never handle it on my own.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when it's going well, but when you're supposed to be there for yourself, your golf player's capacity is fully checked.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up defeated when Europe reached "The Miracle in Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to go to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn as in Medinah.
When this pace is moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
So we set up the assembly and made sure the boys feel as you know, as if we were supposed to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and to stand up to Rory McIllroy in the top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship has yet to be postponed
The latest German naval frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and the snowy coastline, local media reported.
The operation of the leading ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, a brand-new frigate of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit's citing army.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after delivery made the fate of this ambitious project more difficult.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will serve as a replacement for the aged Frigate class of Bremen.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ice ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – the latest frigates should be possible for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the top maritime ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete until they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The well-known F125 frigate got into the paper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the transfer.
Few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental “software errors and defects on metal elements” defects that would render the warship useless when put into combat.
The software failures were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers who were needed on the frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant excess weight, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to add future innovation.
It is believed that Rheinland-Pfal's 7,000-ton ship will be twice as heavy as the ships of a class similar to the ones used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects on the metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including training of the crew – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price rose to EUR 3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the naval army is actually "coming ships capable of deployment".
This representative stated that the problems were constantly packed because the old ships were excluded from service but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class was capable of becoming part of the navy equipment.
The organization of the National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is being carried out at the bat habitat on the Highlands of Scotland to discover how bats are using the landscape to hunt food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique mammals flying and help guide future activities to preserve this species.
The study, carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland Association, will watch bats whistle and the smallest and brown long-haired and watery in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas in this bat habitat, which will monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what species do.
A Habitat map and a message will then be published that creates a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of the work of habitat management, such as arching, and best practices in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland, and the whole of Great Britain, in the last century, are largely extinct.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affect colonies and natural environments.
The risk can also be represented by wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies traps and chemical treatment of construction materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting prey than their eyes.
They use a clever echo-location technique to track bugs and fly obstacles.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taking bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct research, control colonies, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even established the first and only reserved bat reservation at Three in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's residence says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to survive."
It stresses the importance of the control of bats before the start of maintenance work in real estates, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach their hand to the work and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we do not know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape as “false news ” and said that people“ want to be seen ” using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed of these charges.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he subsequently paid her $375 000 to keep the case quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the release of the indictment, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in live video on Instagram to his 142 million trackers and called the information “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time holder of the Golden Ball Award said to the camera.
“They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to charge Der Spiegel with unfounded charges, which they called "unacceptable private suspicions."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the appropriate seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights recently”.
There was supposed to be an incident in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel suite and at the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the playroom, where he allegedly raped her in court at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo kneeled down and told her that he had been “99 percent ” of the “ladzas ” and “one percent ” of the time he failed.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she “was afraid of retaliation” and feared “public humiliation”.
34-year-old woman claims she's trying to re-drive because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronalda at the time of the charge of assault steps from crossing the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom will “forever regret” if it loses its status as world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, the secretary for Greg Clark stated.
He added that it was ‘unsettling’ that Toyota UK informed the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston race, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car said that the impact of the delay on the borders in the event of no agreement on Brexit being concluded could cost jobs.
In a race in Burnaston, where cars Auris and Avensis are manufactured, Toyota made almost 150,000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have recorded a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, spread fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
The BMW, for example, states that it will close its car manufacturing plant at Mini in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on a ‘right time’ basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU delivered for cars manufactured for order in 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to the delay and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock at Derbyshire, the company stated, and this would stop production.
Mr Clark stated that Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU are "exactly calibrated to avoid such border checks".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best business that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been in the Burnaston race for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade unions in the race, said that members of the union organization are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
The speaker said: “We have set a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be late again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be “a week from now,” as he continued to fight for the post of supreme judge with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller's Special Council, which investigates interference in the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions by the President.
Tell Trump to release the deputy general and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, the Washington gossip has been fed up with it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of meeting the president through the 25th supplement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump declared that Rosenstein would prefer not to "regard" but then the meeting was delayed to hear from the Senate Judicial Committee, where they filed Kavanaugh's testimony and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly investigation into the Kavanaugh indictment, which delayed the full Senate vote again.
Trump's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on the Fox Channel.
She replied to a request for a meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set, it may be this week, and it may be necessary to move the next week in view of everything else that is going on at the highest court.
But we'll see, and I'll always communicate up-to-date information with the media."
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not hosted a press conference with the White House since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were caused by an aversion to the “division” of television reporters, even though she said, “I do not agree with the fact that they will come out.”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is holding more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We have looked at the numbers."
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying, and you've seen that we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting high representatives.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why he and his liberated and sometimes bizarre with regard to the reporters gathered.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to worry about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman sent a letter to the SME not six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to resolving the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens who work in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “This summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continue on the retreat, and they are heading towards the expected decision this fall.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and outside the EU bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our hot wish is that you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
The protagonist Tigers from Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, took emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
State's chief coach, Tennessee Rod Reed, informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline and then put him on the stretcher and prepared for another assessment.
A member of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the type/range of injury” are available so far and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in red shirt, takes the first season for the state of Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday he had five overall procedures, which means a total of 18 actions in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
A foreign buyer will be charged a higher real estate tax if he buys real estate in the UK, and in addition money will be used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This act will neutralise the success of Corby's move to attract young voters
Increased liability for higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
It is estimated that the state Treasury will increase by £120 million per year – to help people without a home
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, and in addition money will be used to help people without a home, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in property tax will concern individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money also strengthens the government's efforts to fight sleeping without a roof over their heads.
An allowance which is an addition to the current obligation to pay the property tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago at other houses and purchases for rental purposes, may reach up to three per cent.
The State Treasury is expected to increase funds by up to £120 million per year.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which drives away prices and makes it difficult for those who buy for the first time to get on the ladder home.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time abroad.
The new principles only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after a reduction in the property tax to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by taking land, but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable houses to fix the “vulnerability of home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the cessation of “unusual” evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
“ Last year, I said that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime ministers to the restoration of the British dream — so that every new generation could have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as the hard-working residents of Great Britain.
For a lot of people with a dream of their own home too distant and the dreary sleep without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that his “highest ambition” is to become the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the northeast club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he switched to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren brought back the Scottish Premiership league last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got rank B and it was," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportssound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that will draw me back.
Such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety over following such established names in such a big club when he previously refused to play foreplays by Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Success would then be measured by the question whether I could return this club to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I think I'd be successful if I could just get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, before he was acting as assistant boss in Dumarton, and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the third group descent and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of the fall to the winner of the championship title right next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he has ever had in his career players in the clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably real intersections,” he recalls when Alloa was taken.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, I made good money, and I enjoyed proper heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure, but in management, I just feel good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I feel the most in my adult life right now."

Research found out that the perfect time for the pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the consulting firm CGA, who produced the final reports, stated: “Stable sunlight and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the pub increased 2.8 percent, but the restaurant was even more hit.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June made it even worse in July.
The pubs and liquor bars have so far done the most bad things they have ever done.
The pubs, whose main sales are from food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, of the research firm on leisure activities and hospitality, stated: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and impact of significant social or sporting events are the most important factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, even though the annual decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of the ongoing pressure on costs.
A long hot summer can't be a worse time for food companies and time will tell us whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much needed relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Sales Monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial scale in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that hides from their parents
Every fifth child — only 11 years old — has a secret account on social networks that hides from parents and teachers, research shows
Research among 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in “false Instagram sites”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main account ” that their parents know about
Every fifth child – only 11 years old – creates accounts on social networks that they keep secret from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts ” in which photos are shared.
Reports indicate concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said that they have a decorated “main ” account that their parents know about and at the same time have a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret Web site found that her teenage girl urged others to “rape her. ”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters Association and Headmittresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 - to 18 - year - old students have two profiles, half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “vote of athletes” on the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Committee of the Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Annual Steering Committee General Meeting.
Doyle is the most appreciated lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in sports management like those who will benefit from its far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland if he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to be truly useful and to help lead a sport in Scotland. ”
An American who won a total of four gold medals at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta won a total of four gold medals, and now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attaché.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I went through an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I was going to get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to heal myself, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
The milk vacuum cleaner that causes the mother to compare to cows shares opinions online
The company involved in the production of vacuum cleaners distributed online opinions by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the marketing of "the world's first silent portable vacuum cleaners", Envi produced a music video showing the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack full of cows for a song with the text: "Yes, I do, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed that I don't have any meanings, there are my breasts here."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, water my dear ones with milk. ”
However, the advertisement that was published on the company's Facebook page triggered online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said that it sheds light on the “horry” dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth in order to give milk, but their children are taken a few days after childbirth," one of the comments said.
Elvie vacuum cleaner is discreetly applied to breast milking (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Absolutely traumatic for the mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise at the breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: “This commercial is completely out of control. ”
Some who defended advertising also appeared, and one woman admitted that the song was considered “infectious. ”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I still breast-feed.
The suction makes me feel exactly like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's a big deal.
It is a genius product," wrote one user.
Others added: “It’s a fun commercial aimed at mothers who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
It's not an advertisement to praise or curse the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses, and is beautifully hidden in the breast-feeding bra, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk when it is sucked.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point to the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it, and to show a fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new vacuum will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner got on the air.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially since the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with escorts.
Most escorts were traditionally made immigrants without evidence who were afraid of threatening the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," Mr. Albence said.
According to the staff of the asylum facilities, representatives sought to deal more quickly with children's matters have introduced new rules that would require some of them to be brought before the court within a month before being detained, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many will appear by calling in the video conference instead of personally declaring their case a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are said to have no right to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he will experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, the asylum workers claim and report from the system over the last few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns are raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more likely not to be noticed, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or saying good - bye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announced that US, French and Turkish "occupied" components should be withdrawn immediately
During the speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called after the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the eighth year of the country’s war was under way.
Moual, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “it will be dealt with accordingly.”
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over, ” killing more than 360,000 people since 2011, and losing millions of others to their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue in “the battle in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and“ any illegal foreigners”.
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, mostly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of the war-stricken country.
In the release of refugees, Moualem declared that there were good conditions for them to return and accused “some Western lands ” of“ spreading irrational fears ” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have called on international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a protection zone at the last Idlib shelter created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces protected by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military intervention would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from Nusra Front with links to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated".
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition will soon be held to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "control of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before the action was taken.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won in other elections in 2020 if, hopefully, a lot of liberal observers, the prosecutions and scandals had not ended his office as president prematurely.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history! ”
So far, no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased the coverage on cable TV to 3.5 million watching the main night news.
"It is the heat that attracts people because it is something we do not understand," said Neal Baer, an operator of the show "Designed Survival" on ABC drama about the secretary of the cabinet who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced author of comedy and show “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said: "Because it is funny with him," Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story happening in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, no matter what immigrant families can reconnect and for the benefit of the global economy.
Dismantling is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you watch for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," he spends 15 000 USD of Paul Manafort's leather jackets ("dressing arrogance" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of the disgusting display of Mr Trump Stormy Daniels' "anatomy."
I won't be looking at Super Maria the same way again, among other things.
“A part of what he does and what makes you feel real is that he feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and author of Pawn Stars’ paper on rotating N.F.L. Trump’s show, in which he appreciates Kim Jong-un.
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you'll be behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny out on the north coast of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was trapped inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up for the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the highest court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money flows to the narrowest domestic contests of the mid-term election
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing financial inflows thanks to the reorganisation of congressional districts that have generated two holders of the office in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by the provincial democratic republic of Conor Lamb – which won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily intertwined with the new 17th.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of the republicans, there was a re-painting of maps.
The race in the new 17th district launched a sharp financial gap between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March 18th special election.
This chair has been occupied by the Republican for over a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Policy experts are giving the Democrats a slight head start.
America decides to fine Salvador for China's support, then retreats
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially relocated the organization team of Trump's leadership.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the US Directors of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to further recognize Taiwan," said the spokesman for the Ministry of Health Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the fines were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included the reduction of financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With the ongoing internal talks, the North American and Central American high-level representatives of the Conference on Security and Economic Prosperity, followed by similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the US.
But by mid-September, senior executives explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively complete any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now responsible for resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal issued by the administration at the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
The White House speaker, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to government enforcement and also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The final nail to the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr Trump in the exercise of the law, which is now in public records a great deal of evidence.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller also reportedly refers to whether Mr Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there had been an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have had to report to that body for responsibility, as he was preparing to re-apply to the electorate, and in the end a jury made up of his colleagues would probably expect him.
This is a series of "if" and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will continue.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to organize a coup against Hitler, only to have the Western powers stand up and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are now facing several similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, here's the man who's in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been on it ever since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health to stand up for the Presidential Office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation by F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if confirmed in the Supreme Court despite convincing charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, shall we vote in the middle of the term of office for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I believe we are not failing, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table about the Sabbath.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the knowledge that victory over Rakusany would give them a great hope for the European League Group's G procedure earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented backup Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said 31-year-old player.
“We went to the fight with the belief that we could tear something up, and we took the point away.
Perhaps we could have multiplied it in the end, but overall, the tie was probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we improved and we were better again.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard because in the last game they've won a good result. But with the viewers behind my back I'm sure we can push and it'll turn out well.
Last year was hard enough, with all my injuries and the changes in the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, training's fine.
I hope we're back on it now, throw last season over our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women worry about savings on pensions
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they were to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the national study reported that they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't want to talk to him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and family discuss where and how to receive care, because these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Ask your financial advisor: A counselor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or through your own self-insurance, using your own resources – while you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as possible.
You will appoint a healthcare representative, which will be a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also consider writing down full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not qualify for it.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent needs medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write these details into your written plan to be ready.

The police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as a "accidental act".
The assailant's victim didn't see it.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials believe that the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since the communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from Donggal's regent, which is an area north of Pal, which is closer to the 7.5 degree earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal.
Here are a few key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city had just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
Regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
The production of nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morala on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organization Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggal have already hit tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami struck the west of Donggala in 1996 when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and there is a regular earthquake.
Here's a list of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: The great earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most popular island Java and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The light earthquake affected the regentry of Pidia Jaya in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic, as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was formed this time, but more than 100 died of falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governors and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old Palin living in the town of Vasila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports and prevention of arrest.
When a police report said his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of USD 500, reports KTUU.
According to a network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he felt “certainly innocent ” when asked for an opinion.
Palin faces three Class A violations, which means he could be sentenced to up to $250,000 for a year of imprisonment and fine.
At the same time, he was charged with a class B offence punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin has to face criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported an alleged assault on the police.
The case is currently before the Alaskan war veterans' court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics associated with the incident.
Apparently, he hit his girlfriend in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by war veteran groups when she linked her son's violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son's service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after Friday an earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out of operation and in the coming days, the number of victims is expected to rise.
The earthquake struck directly on the rubble part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in Palu when tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a special death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York City where eight people have died – a special punishment that has not been imposed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a cycle trail along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, using a rented truck called Home Depot, which was trashed by walkers and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a series of injuries — thus defining the conditions of intent to grant the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both those figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saip with 22 crimes, including murder charges in favour of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation", the plaintiffs claim, and describe the manner in which Saip's act was committed, as disgusting, cruel and perverted."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijová, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnicca,” is mentioned in the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York last sentenced him to death.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time, the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were shown conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret according to court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's indictment to the authorities, he was inspired to watch videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
The police also announced that they also demanded the suspension of the Islamic State flag in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public attorneys representing Saipov, said that they were “obviously disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and sentencing to life without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
Saip's defense team had already asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
According to the members of the Conservative Party, it should be entrusted with the negotiations on Brexit, Nigel Farage
During today's protest, Nigel Farage committed himself to "mobilising an army of people".
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said that politicians must "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own members suggested – should negotiate with the EU precisely.
Private conservative Member Peter Bone announced on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out" if he was Secretary for Brexit, Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in appeasement of her ranks, where there is a deep divide, is further highlighted by the conservatives fighting for a stay in the EU, who joined the separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan from the Chequers under way under attack by the supporters of Brexit, the supporters of the EU and the EU itself.
The allies insist that they will continue to seek agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force the Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its "chaos".
Mr Bone said that Leave Means Leave would meet in Solihull, where he wanted to "screw Chequers".
He suggested to Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out today," he said.
Member Wellingborough added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must leave the Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to have to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely depraved."
The conservative supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who also took part in the march, told reporters: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they do not like our party members or our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report for Mrs May, he says: 'The Prime Minister will keep his place when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians must "get into an unpleasant situation" if they would like to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them "we won't let you do that."
He added in the report to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of this country’s people, who have given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain, which rules ourselves.”
In the meantime, the Union's supporters marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists have been waving banners to the Brexit Conservatives after the weekend start of this party's operation.
Labour MP Lord Adonis made fun of conservatives because of the security problems of the party's application after the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for trouble-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a mess.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to think about running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that after the November elections, she would “consider running for president. ”
Boston Globe reports a Democrat from Massachusetts talked about her future on Saturday at the Town Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting to re-elect the Republic's representative, Geoffrey Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the council since Trump sat in office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to apply for the office of president.
Warren replied that the time had come for the women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means the woman in the highest place. ”

Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had detained a suspect from Friday's shooting of a basketball player to LSU Wayd Sims.
Police Department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released from Friday's shooting with a request for identification of the man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that did not coincide with life," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the website 247sports.
Wade was trying to protect his boyfriend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to moving at the scene, had a gun, and confessed to killing Wade Sims.
Simpson was wiped out without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches high Sims, which grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per match.
Great prize for Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion when the team director played a handball on Sebastian Vettel.
As soon as Valtteri Bottas ended up in Saturday's qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the team director of the Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the position field Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two turns he defended his position and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first, and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling on the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider drove into a bicycle depot later, and after his departure he joined Vettel. However, Hamilton headed forward and in close combat had to reluctantly leave the Ferrari rider free to defend himself in the third turn after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the back row of the field and at the end of the first round he was in charge on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he led after much of the race because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kim Raikkon's fourth position.
Finally, he drove to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at the Saturday meeting for insisting that she had not published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement given to Ford before the Senate Judicial Commission, but instead declared that what was happening in the Senate was “evil and repulsive and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that has happened in the last days in Senar, when you see this anger when you see these people being angry and angry and disgusting and lying," he said.
“When you look at the release and the publication and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you blame this escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document – oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, it's not," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and information escaped early in September – but Feinstein refused to escape her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s complaint, nor did I publish information on the case,” said Clomis Feinstein, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, the president, who expressed himself at the Saturday evening meeting, apparently did not believe her words: “I tell you this is a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but anyway, it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, accused by three women of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats used these charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to take too much back by any means available.
You see the wickedness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to push back into the country to get back to power and to the helm," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants versus Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed Friday's game in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's payback in Dundee, which ended in 5-3.
The Giants soon took on a two-way lead thanks to the intervention of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle home before Dwyer got the Giants back in charge.
Francois Bouchard then again compared for Dundee, and two of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's goal was to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat in the elite league in the season for a team of Adam Keefe who managed to beat 2-1 at Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous matches controlled by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came at the fourth minute, at the time of 3:35, for Kendall McFaulla's assistant, while David Rutherford signed up for assistance at Beauville's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home to the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt scored for Cownie, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the first break cabin only in the lead when he recorded his second goal at the end of the first third.
The homeowners regrouped, and Bouchard again managed to match the goal from the game of power at 27:37.
The co-operation of Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen later in the second third of the game for the first time in a game to shift the lead to the Dundee side and the same player ensured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final third.
Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game at home Friday at Milton Keynes.
The air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
The commander of the air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died as he made sure that the plane was able to fly safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are missing after a great tsunami - causing earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong subsequent earthquakes flooded the area, and many remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, while colleagues of Anthony Gunavan Agung, a 21 - year - old, fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his post in a wildly repulsive driving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in his position to ensure that Flight Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time on the ranve, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the steering tower down when he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, spokeswoman for air traffic, told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've prepared a transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, where he was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management said that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unforgivable and many of them still have not been reached by rescue workers," said the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The waves in the devastated Pal reached a height of up to six meters, and mass funerals will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft transport assistance and supplies to the affected locations.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News station: “Another body will be brought here every minute.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small stores have been stolen everywhere."
John Gelfand, head of the international Red Cross in Indonesia, said to that CNN station: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military forces: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed for evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
An airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the islands in the Pacific now stated that one person was missing, stating at first that all passengers and crew of 47 were safely evacuated from a diving aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find a traveling man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline stated that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for providing details on this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane entered the water in an attempt to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials claimed that a total of seven persons were transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained under medical care on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just before the landing.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very small altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he and others managed to get water down the lane deep into the emergency exits of the diving aircraft.
He further stated that the crew panicked and shouted and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked near port pier repairs helped rescue by means of an inflatable boat carried by passengers to shore before the plane sank into the depths of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network reports that in the last two decades, a total of 111 people died in plane accidents with a PNG registration mark, but no accidents occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The indictment closed on Saturday in this case, in which the man was repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
A jury analyst planned a scenario using the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localized data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was in Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statement, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When his cell phone records showed that he was spending the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police visited him.
Sanford stood before the court in the tent and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that “he is lying because my car was in Nashville that night. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he erased Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin their closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and social problems.
Therefore, they want to return to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have already met with the revival of the past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?!
New York's tutor sues a few for her expulsion after a "racist" text message
A New Yorker sues a couple for her discriminatory expulsions after receiving a missent text message from her mother, in which she was marked as a "further black" text message.
A couple refused to be racist and compared the lawsuit with “rape. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed horror when on her first day at work in 2016 she found that her new teacher, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEETHER, OTHER BLACK,” she wrote to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman, in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her in twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, “concerned, ” fired Mrs. Maurice and said that her outgoing tutor, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting the Filipino instead, reported the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple of compensations for dismissal and requesting USD 350 for the day of the six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," Post said this Friday and added, "I know this is discrimination."
However, the couple returned the blow by not being racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was a suitable measure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco Post.
"But would you trust your child in the hands of someone you treated harshly, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “rape ” and said that his wife only cared for a two - month - old child and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"Would you like to drive around like this?
This is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the court is still going on, the jury on social media sentenced the two of them very quickly for their conduct and logic.
Publishers of stories about Bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, show the latest reports
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel in the situation of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very funny to know now that we already know the great success of Paddington Bear."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, she added on the day of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a “sweet mountain” point after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family, ” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he had never been much of a boaster," she said.
"But since Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like having a child who achieved something that you could really be proud of.
I believe he was looking at Paddington's success with this view.
Although it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all success to Paddington alone."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye on the phone
After her landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that she does not expect to get out of it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I had a call from Nada telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
That's how I did it.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart going, slowly losing their effectiveness and leaving her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head down, and tears ran through my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt an amazing understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis’s son was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his sibling’s immobile body after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I’m constantly afraid of the effect this will have on his life. ”
Ms. Davis proposed a postcard “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and who can talk to them even if it is about their friends.
Don't be quiet – you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' summer friend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing told me he was feeling down, or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
"We then observed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
It was the worst day of Christmas – when the children opened gifts or looked at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a great trauma to them, but she had to get through it gradually: “This thing can make a hole in the family.
It ripped us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on how the FBI starts its investigation.
"I thought that we could get something that Mr Flake asked for – an investigation at a time of limitation, with limited scope – we could bring a little unity into it," Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would "disintegrate" because both parties would bury themselves in positions acquired after partisanism.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The elections in the middle of the electoral period are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the republicans go wrong as expected, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to force the required man to stand before the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbied for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI puts together his report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea for Kim has “decreased”
The number of refugees from North Korea has fallen since the beginning of the government of Kim Jong-Un seven years ago, according to South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug Park, quoted from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said that there had been 1,127 escapes in the past year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that there were more stringent checks at the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates of required smugglers at the borders.
Pjjongjang has not issued any public statement on this matter.
Today, the vast majority of North refugees receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed borders.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relations between North and South – which are still technically at war – have improved considerably in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchjongjang for talks that focused on stopped denuclearisation talks.
This was the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions for cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the US of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said he was unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosio, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysteric” and said that thanks to her temper, she was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosio made this note in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help but if any woman ever performed such a theatre, they would call it "hysteric," Pelosio said in her reaction to Kavanaugh's Thursday statement before the Senate Judicial Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both young.
During his opening remarks Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating in discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" organised by liberals who were unable to move through the Hillary Clintons' 2016 presidential election.
Pelosio said that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work with the Supreme Court because he showed that he was pre-empted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosio replied negatively to the question whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal if he confirmed it, even if the Democrats had obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not only eligible for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is working on now,” said Pelosiová.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosio added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential benefits in court under the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearing prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would return any rulings of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, pre-eminent person to go to court and expect us to just say, "Oh, my God, that's beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal outbursts, months and years of anger, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we have anger," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was working for the principal and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘ Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And that's how she kept going.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated me. I once expressed my inexpressable anger with crying. But an older, always cold manager, who I always feared a little, grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
He thinks you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, a formerly democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarried affair aboard the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and Seven Dwarfs."
But since the campaign had been running for a long time, it could not keep up with getting contributions, and so it committed itself not to go to the game unless it received $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does he think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome with her emotions – as expressions of gratitude to the people who supported her, she was frustrated with the system that made it difficult for her to get money and focus on the electorate rather than on the delegates and from anger over sexism, that she was completely choked by rage.
"You might think that I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder said about how the press reacted to it.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they might write on my tombstone.
"Weeping"?
Why Chinese-American trade war for Beijing can be good
The opening salvage of the US-China trade war was deafening and although the battle is not far from being fought, according to experts, the long-term gap between the countries is advantageous for Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
However, most of the most significant escalations saw the world light this week when new tariffs for goods were announced for USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which practically means taxation of half of Chinese exports to the USA.
Beijing has always responded, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China was trying to repay the US with the same coin and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy would kneel.
Although China would have wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, it would have stood down to its demands, but public submission to the American requirements would have been totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin-ping.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The reality is that the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic twist in both countries. This is far more dangerous than observers have allowed," said Abigail Grace, a research co-worker who focuses on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the Foreign Minister claims
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal conditions.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes any help in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe responded strongly to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US Team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National on the edge of the problem in France.
The United States has now lost after six years on European soil, so it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who was most of the tour's trouble, then fired a ball into the water on the 3 pairs of 16 holes and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golfer Molinari then radiated in all his rounds and became one of 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the existing format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Top rated world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran 8 Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the overall best European player with 25.5 points gained in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy that I got my cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He served a cup to his countryman John Ramp, who beat the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time who won 14 greatest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team saved the whole weekend trying to find the fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States, after the dissatisfaction of his team, said: “I’m proud of these boys, they really fought.
We really warmed up Europe this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I smell my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 guys. I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really have to go soft.
You've lost us."
Red tide update: Concentrations decrease in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decline in the concentration of the red tide in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC report, water stains are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this suggests decreasing concentration.
The blooming water of the red tide is about 130 miles off the coast from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The stains were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week it was relatively smaller.
