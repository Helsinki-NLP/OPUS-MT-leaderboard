The amendment to the proposal was already adopted by the two chambers in 2011.
A change was made in this legislative session when the second sentence was first deleted from the Chamber of Representatives and then adopted in a similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes a ban on single-sex civil marriages, may likely open the door to civil marriages in the future.
Following the process, Decision HJR-3 will be reviewed again in 2015 or 2016 by the next elected legislative body in order to continue the process.

China has developed a market economy over the past three decades, although it has officially remained a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has grown 90 times.
Last year, China first took more cars from Germany and surpassed the US as the largest car market.
By 20 years, China’s GDP could be greater than that of the United States.
The tropical storm Daniel, the fourth known as the storm of the 2010 hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, was formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which developed about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum constant winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Daniel will become a hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the Caribbean basin or the United States.
Bobek, who was born in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, became famous as he played for Partizan Belgrade.

"Nothing happened to me, fortunately, but I saw a creepy scene, because people were trying to break windows to get out.
People used chairs to hit the glass, but the windows didn't break.
The survivor Francisek Koval said one of the glass finally broke and they started coming out of the window."
Because of the energy generated by the fusion of hydrogen atoms (or their fusion) to form heavier elements, the stars emit light and heat.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthesis reactors.
The steel needle is retained on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
The reason for the surface voltage is that the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create invisible skin on its surface that allows things like the needle to float from above.
The edge of the modern hook has a double edge with a hole in the middle. Both edges provide better adhesion to the ice, even at the slope.
The edge, which is in contact with the ice, also bends as the lower part of the blade is slightly curved as it leans towards one side or the other.
This allows the skater to turn. If the skaters bend to the left, the skater turns to the left, if the skaters bend to the right, the skater turns to the right.
They must get rid of the additional energy they receive from the light in order to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by emitting small particles of light called “photons”.
This process is called by scientists “stimulated radiation radiation” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing the radiation of photons, and light is a form of radiation.
The next picture shows radiant photon atoms. In fact, photons are much smaller than the ones in the picture.
The photons are smaller than even the matter that builds the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, the spiral in the light bulb burns and it no longer works.
The pear needs to be changed after this. You need to be careful when changing the electric bulb.
First, the switch for the illuminating body or the cable shall be switched off.
This is done because the electricity that flows into the contact where the metal part of the bulb is located can cause a strong electric shock. This can happen if you touch the inner part of the contact or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in contact.
The main organ of the blood system is the heart, which has the function of pumping blood.
The blood is removed from the heart by tubes called “arteries” and returns back to the heart by tubes called “venes”. The smallest pipes are called “capillaries”.
Triceratops could chew its teeth not only by leaf but also by many hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, the triceratops ate cicadas, which are a kind of plant common during the period of chalk.
These plants are like miniature palm trees with crowns of sharp, prickly leaves.
Triceratops might have used his healthy man to peel the leaves before eating the trunk.
There are also scientists who argue that these plants are very poisonous and it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, although nowadays sloths and other animals such as parrots (the offspring of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you step on its surface, you'll weigh less than when you're on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds (16 kg) of Yo. Gravity, of course, will work less.
Unlike Earth, the sun has no crust that you can step on, and it's all made of gas, fire, and plasma.
The gas is thinning away from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the Sun that we see when we look at it is called the “photosphere” or “ball light”.
The Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just like the moon some 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The phases happen because only the sun's facing side of Venus (or the moon) is illuminated. The phases of Venus support Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, the English astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed the transit of Venus.
England is experiencing a long period of peace after Denlo's retake.
However, in 991, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet greater than any other in the Guthrum century.
This fleet is run by Olaf Trigwason, a Norwegian with ambitions to free his country from Danish domination.
After the initial military failures, Etelred was able to agree on the terms of his return to Norway, Olaf, who was trying to win the kingdom with mixed success.
Hangul is the only purposeful alphabet popular in everyday use. The alphabet was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).
King Sejong is the fourth and one of the most respected kings of the Choson Dynasty.
Initially, it is called "Hunmin Geongeum" the Hangeul alphabet, meaning "the right sounds to instruct people".
There's a lot of theories about how the Sanskrit came to be, one for the Western Aryans who brought the language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to those spoken in Latin in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world is written on Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit simply fades away because of the hierarchy.
As Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as a source of many modern Indian languages.
With the end of the battle for France, Germany is preparing to invade the British island.
The code name of the attack of Germany is "Operation Sillion". Most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost when it was evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the royal fleet was still much stronger than the German fleet ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasion ships sent through Lamansha.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were stationed near the likely invasion routes, as the admirals feared that they would be sunk by German air raids.
Let's start with the explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Japan and Germany.
There was a weaker army and a weaker fleet, even though they had built four new ships just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries. To conquer those countries, they had to have a platform to allow troops to cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
So it was necessary for them to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian warships did not have to do anything else.
Now for Japan, like Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II, and then they were very slow and they had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mostly on the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate to avoid being noticed, the submarines were forced to swim underwater.
German submarines are called submarines. Germans were very good at navigation and management of their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after the war they have no confidence in having many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called King Tut or "King Boy", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian pharaohs of modern times."
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not included in most lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 turned him into a celebrity. Although many tombs of the past were looted, it was left almost intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun are well stored, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spindle wheels made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better equipped to beat soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows from their deadly arsenals could penetrate the armor of rivals.
Cavalry is an army that fights against a horse. The Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of its horses because the saddle had not yet been invented.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Omar - the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems "Iliad" and "Odyseus", is probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Sophocles and Aristofan are still popular dramatists and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, known mostly for his famous theorem on the relationship between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is believed that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used languages in the world.
The number of speaking local languages varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted or not.
Estimates vary from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, but they are written differently; those who speak both languages can usually understand each other in daily conversations.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
In their desire to draw God closer to the local people, some German monks invented the Estonian literal language.
It is based on the German alphabet by adding a letter ‘Õ/õ’.
Over time, many words borrowed from the German language came together, and that was the beginning of enlightenment.
More traditionally, the heir to the throne enters the army directly after finishing school.
Charles, however, records the University of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history and received 2:2 (lower grade second class).
The first member of the British royal family to be awarded a diploma was Charles.
Three per cent of the country is covered by European Turkey (East Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula).
Turkey's territory is over 1,600 kilometers long (1000 miles) and over 800 km wide (500 miles), with the rough shape of a rectangle.
The area of Turkey, including the lakes, is 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are in southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and is the size of the city of France and the United Kingdom taken together.
Turkey is surrounded by three seas: Aegean to the west, Black to the north and Mediterranean to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it's independent since 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium are becoming Belgian after the 1830 Belgian Revolution, but they were part of Luxembourg in the past.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but it is occupied by Germany both during World War I and in World War II.
Luxembourg became the founder of an organization known today as the European Union in 1957.
Printgial Dzong is a Buddhist monastery and a destroyed fortress in the upper part of the district of Paro (S. Pondi).
It is said that Jabbadrung Ngawang Namgiel built a fortress in 1649 to mark his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian army.
In 1951, only some of the relics of Dzong Druckgial, such as the image of Jabbadrung Ngawang Namgial, survived the fire.
After the fire the fortress was preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was pushed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais took Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and Phnom Penh destroyed it in 1772.

Eighteen per cent of Venezuelan citizens are unemployed, and most of those employed work in the field of the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and one fifth work in agriculture.
Petrol is an important adult for Venezuelans, and the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of people are employed in the oil industry.
At the beginning of the country's independence, expert knowledge of Singapore's botanical gardens helped the island become a tropical garden.

Each year around October, nearly 1.5 million weeds move to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River through the hills in the north because of the rains.
And then back to the north, passing through the western territory and crossing the Mara River again after the rains around April.
The territory of Serengeti in Tanzania includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Protected Zone and the Maswa Hunting Reserve, as well as the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires traditional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive classes (storyboard, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate your perceptions of media production and learn to think nonlinearly.
Interactive design requires the components of a project to connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate unit.
The focal complexity and number of lens elements needed to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than in ordinary lenses and this is the lack of magnifying lenses.
This problem is becoming smaller as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of lenses.
This allowed the lenses to increase to produce quality photos compared to that achieved with lenses with fixed length of focus.
Another deficiency of the magnifying lenses is that usually the maximum aperture (the severity) of the lens is lower.
This makes cheap scale lenses difficult to use without flashing at low levels of light.
Among the most common problems in trying to convert a DVD film is overscanning.
Most TVs are made to please the general public.
So all you see on TV is with the edges cut off from the top, from the bottom and from the side.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called an image that exceeds the borders of the screen.
When you make a DVD, its ends, unfortunately, will probably be cut off and if the video has subtitles too close to the bottom end, they will not be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination by shouting at the mind images of tournaments, feasts and the knight spirit of King Arthur.
Though standing among thousands of years of ruins, it is not difficult to hear the sounds and smell the odors of long - gone battles, to hear the hooves of the web almost scratching and to smell the fear of rising from the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are castles ever built? How are they designed and built?
The Kirby McSlow Castle is typical of this period and looks more like a fortified house than a real castle.
The big glass windows and the thin walls wouldn't last long in a determined attack.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings was involved in its construction, the country was relatively peaceful and needed protection only against small groups of wandering sailors.
The balance of power was a system in which European countries sought to preserve the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations must strive to prevent a nation from becoming strong, and national governments often change their alliances to maintain balance.
The first war, whose main issue was the balance of power, was the war for the Spanish heritage.
This marks an important change since the European forces no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years War will be the last war called “religious”.
In a burning by Herodotus on July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at all costs to achieve glory. The outraged Ephesians announced that the name of Hestrat would never have been entered.
Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, and so we know today, the temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
As king, Alexander proposed to take the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
While you are still hitting all the notes correctly, make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible; also try not to make many improper movements with your fingers.
This way you will get as tired as possible. Remember that you do not need to press the keys strongly for additional sound strength as the piano.
To get an additional volume in the accordion, use a more pressure or speed-weighted buffer.
Mysticism is a quest for communication, identification or conscious awareness of complete reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
Direct experience, intuition or insight into the divine reality/godship or deities is sought by the believer.
Followers adopt certain life practices designed to feed these experiences.
Mysticism can be recognized among other forms of religious beliefs and honors by emphasizing the direct personal experience of a unique state of mind, especially with a peaceful, perceptive, blissful or even admiring character.
The Sikh religion is from the Indian subcontinent. It dates back to the 15th century from the Punjab region from a sectarian division in Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion separate from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gourmet, which in Punjabi means “the path of the guru”. The guru is a fundamental aspect in all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has acquired a meaning that forms the core of beliefs.
Religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469 – 1539).
However, in June 1956 Kruschev's promises were put to the test. At the same time, the riots in Poland, where workers protested food shortages and wage cuts, became a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he accepted some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Gomulka as the new prime minister.
It covers most of today's Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan is the civilization of the Indus Valley, which is a bronze civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
Civilization flourished in the area of the Indus River, where its name came from.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization existed in the pools of the already dried river Sarasvati, it must be called the Ind-Saraswati civilization, while some call it Harapa civilization of Harapa's name, the first of its sites to be unearthed in 1920.
The development of medicine has been aided by the military character of the Roman Empire.
Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to be used after the battles.
The surgeons knew various sedatives, including morphine from poppy seed extracts and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They gain considerable experience in amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as the use of tunicets and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has made great progress in the field of medicine and has formed a large part of what we know today.
Pureland origami is an origami with the restriction that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds such as reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple positions.
It was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to help unexperienced folders or persons with limited motor skills.
Children are quite young to develop understanding of race and racial stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with a racial minority, which is stereotypical, not doing well at school, after learning about the stereotyping associated with their race, usually fail at school.
MySpace currently has 54 million user profiles and is the third most popular website used in the USA.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These web pages have positive aspects that include the possibility of easily creating a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other functions.
You can get easy access to this page by providing only one web address that facilitates remembering and writing for students who would have problems using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be personalized so that you can read easily, as well as with many or few colors, as you wish.
Attention deficit syndrome is a neurological syndrome whose classic determinant triad of symptoms includes impulsiveness, a tendency to distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a learning problem, but a learning disorder; it “may affect 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million American children”.
Children with Attention Deficit Syndrome (ADD) find it difficult to focus on school work, but they can concentrate on things they like to do, play games or write sentences without punctuation, or watch their favorite animations.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because they “have a risky behavior, enter into battle, and seek authority ” to stimulate their brain, since their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The lack of attention syndrome affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they behave this way, or why they spell it this way, or why their maturity level is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn has changed in the manner described above, the basic speed at which knowledge is acquired has also changed.
The approach to getting information was different. There is no more pressure within individual cancellation, now the focus is on the possibility of canceling text.
Overall, throughout the Renaissance, the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge is changing considerably.
Unlike other primates, hominids are already using their hands to carry weights, sway trees and move.
The chimpanzee’s hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight when walking with a bone.
The human hand has more real phalanges and is shorter than the foot.
Fossil bones from two to three million years of age reveal this change in hand specialization from movement to processing.
Some people believe that the frequent experience of very artificially conscious dreams can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is because of clear dreams that increase the time between states of rapid eye movement (REM).
With less REM per night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as tiring as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream clearly during the night.
In North Africa, things did not go well for the Italians almost from the beginning. Within a week of the declaration of war from Italy on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Husar Regiment conquered Fort Capusco in Libya.
The British capture the main engineer of the Italian tenth army, General Lastucci, in an ambush east of Bardiya.
On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balboa, governor-general of Libya and heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire during a landing in Tobruk.
Modern sports fencing is practiced at many levels - from students following at the university to professional and Olympic competitions.
Sports are practiced mainly in the form of a duel, and one fencing man is dueling another.
In a golf game, players use pins to hit holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, with players usually starting from the first hole in the field and ending in the eighteenth.
The player who takes the least punches or swings with the bat to finish the track wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass next to the hole is mowed low and called green.
Probably the most common type of tourism is one associated with travel by most people: recreational tourism.
When people go to a place that's very different from their normal daily lives to relax and have fun, we talk about it.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are often the most visited places by holiday tourists.
If the purpose of the visit is to get to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can look at different sights in the country or choose to focus on only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also called for reinforcements.
The troops, which reinforce the front positions, included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 people under the command of Colonels James Reid and John Stark (both later become generals).
On the fence at the north end of the position of the Colonists took positions with Stark's men.
When the tide opened the ravine along the river Mystic River along the northeast peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall north, ending at the edge of the water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no shooting until civilians crossed.
The American plan envisaged coordinated attacks from three different countries.
General John Cadwalder would launch a deflective attack against the British garrison in Bordeaux to block possible reinforcements.
General James Ewing will translate 700 military forces into the Trenton ferry, take the bridge over Asunpink Creek and prevent the enemy troops from escaping.
The main storm force of 2,400 will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene's command and one under Sullivan's command to launch the attack before dawn.
With the change of running from a quarter mile to a half mile, the speed becomes much less, while endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, the first-class runner of 800 meters, a person who can run the distance in less than two minutes, must have a high speed, but endurance must be trained at all costs.
Several cross country runs during the winter, combined with gymnastic exercises for the upper body, are the best preparation for the refugee season.
Only proper eating practices cannot produce an excellent result, but can significantly affect the overall good health of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, they have effective hydration habits and understand the different aspects of the use of additives, athletes can improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.
There are many misunderstandings about the small equipment required to participate in running medium distances, which is relatively cheap sport.
Where necessary, products may be purchased, but most of them will have little or no real impact on the result.
The athletes may feel that they prefer a certain product even when it does not bring real benefit to them.
The atom can be regarded as one of the main building blocks of the whole matter.
This is a very complex unit that according to the simplified Bor model consists of a central core and orbiting electrons around it, something like the planets around the sun - see Fig. 1.1.
The core consists of two types of particles – protons and neutrons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge until the neutrons have any.
Before you check on the victim, you must first look around and make sure you're safe.
When you approach the victim you need to notice his or her position and any automatic red flags.
If you hurt yourself while trying to help, you can only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and blackness mediate the relationship between pain and disability in those suffering from lower back pain.
Only the consequences of a disaster, not depression and fear, depended on regular weekly PA sessions.
Participants in regular activity needed more support with regard to the negative perception of pain, to distinguish chronic pain from feeling uncomfortable with normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye structures with different complexity according to the requirements of the body.
Different structures have different properties, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing to make sense of input data as well as different numbers to work optimally.
The collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area is a population.
When all individuals in a particular population are identical to a given phenotype feature, they are defined as monomorphic.
Individuals are polymorphic when they demonstrate several variants of a certain feature.
Warrior ant colonies also march and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, the soldier ants march at night and stop camping during the day.
After the available food has decreased, the colony begins the nomad phase. During this phase the colony makes temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic riots or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella”, meaning “small room”, and was originally created by a microscope who observed the structure of the cork.
The main unit of all living things is the cell, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so essential and important to studying life that they are often defined as “the building blocks of life. ”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain blood flow and its inescapability.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly to the entire body that it helps to protect itself from any potential threats.
The tornado hits a small area compared to other raging storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
The tornado is uprooting trees, pulling planks out of buildings, and raising cars high up in the sky. The most violent 2 percent of the tornadoes have lasted more than three hours.
These monster storms come with winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
For thousands of years, people have made and used lenses to enlarge.
However, the first real telescopes in Europe were made at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us and the nature of cooperation is that when the majority wins, there will always be more to gain if we act selfishly
Our hope is for most people to realize that the best long-term solution is to work on a team with the others.
Many people dream of the day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what is there, others believe that extraterrestrials or other life can live on another planet.
But if that ever happens, it probably won't happen for a very long time. There are trillions of miles between stars that are "neighbors." So scattered are the stars.
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand on top of an alien world, wondering about their ancient ancestors?
The bodies of animals are made up of many cells, they eat different things and grind them into their stomachs.
Only animals have brains (although not all; jellyfish, for example, do not).
Animals are found all over the earth, digging underground, swimming in the oceans and flying into the sky.
One cell is the smallest structural and functional link of the living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, translated “small room”.
If you look under a microscope at living things, you'll see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist in England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
He was the first person to watch dead cells.
To move from one state to another and not to change the elements and compounds can.
Nitrogen in a gaseous state still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water, which consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, it has the same molecular structure.
Although his physical condition may change, the chemical remains unchanged.
Time is all around us and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time is studied by scholars in the sphere of religion, philosophy, and science for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events from the future to the present and then the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark your own time by observing recurring events. It is a cyclical event that happens over and over at regular intervals.
In our time, computers are used to manipulate photos and videos.
Complex animations can be created on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded with complex computers for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first settlers of New Zealand were Maoris who hunted giant birds called moa.
Then the theory assumes the idea that Maoris migrated from Polynesia with a great fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriards, establishing an agricultural society.
But new evidence suggests that Moriori were a group of Maoris from the land migrated from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham, developing their own recognizable, peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham, there was another tribe, the Maoris, who migrated far from New Zealand.
They were called Moriards, and there were a few fights, and the Moriards were eventually destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions while at the same time appreciating the challenges and even the failures.
As we listened to people sharing their personal, family, and organizational stories, we gained a valuable understanding of the past and some of the individuals who influenced the culture of the organization.
Understanding history at least helps people get an idea of where they're going in the history of the organization, although it doesn't mean understanding culture.
Individuals and all involved discover deeper values, mission and movement of the organization by assessing successes and realizing failures.
In this case, what helped people to be open to new changes and new guidelines for the local church was to recall previous cases of entrepreneurial behaviour and achievements.
Similar examples of success have reduced fears of change, while creating positive tendencies towards a change in the future.
Convergence thinking models are techniques to solve problems that combine different ideas or areas to reach a solution.
Speed, logic and accuracy are the focus of this thinking, as well as the discovery of facts, the re-implementation of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important condition for this way of thinking is that only one answer is correct. It is thought of only two answers, namely faithful or sinful.
This type of thinking is associated with certain standard procedures or such in science.
People with this kind of thinking have logical thinking, they can easily remember models, solve tasks and work on scientific tests.
In reading the minds of other people are far the most talented species.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the perceptions of others, their intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires.
Understanding the intentions of others is crucial among these abilities. It allows us to resolve the possible ambiguities of physical actions.
If you see someone break a car window, for example, you'll probably think they're trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he'd lost his car keys and tried to break his own car, he should have been tried differently.
JMR was based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear-magnetic resonance, discovered in 1930 by Felix Block (Standford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
The magnetic field and the radio waves make the atoms emit tiny radio signals in this resonance.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for the use of magnetic resonance images as a means of medical diagnosis.
Four years later, he was issued a patent, which was the first world such one to be awarded in the area of the MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner "for the whole body", which he called "Unbreakable".
Asynchronous communication encourages you to take time to think and cause a reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace, as well as to control the rate of getting information.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints with flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
Using the Internet and the world network, students have access to information at all times.
At any time of the day, students can also ask the instructors questions and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting until the next live meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolutes. There is no good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Learning happens through experience between a student and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the training television shows such as “do your own thing” and presenting information illustrates this.
Most of us watch a television broadcast that informs us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never repair a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins, or remodel a neighbor’s home.
Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population, which has access to the Internet thanks to underwater optical cable connections with Europe and a broadband satellite.
Your hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or a private home) will probably have wifi or PC with internet connection, and all the villages have internet coffee or some place with public wifi.
As we said above, although the word “eskimos” remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered offensive by many northern peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada.
Although you may hear the locals of Greenland using the word, foreigners should avoid doing so.
The local inhabitants of Greenland in Canada are called "inuitites", and in Greenland itself "khalalek" (multiple "kalitis"), or "Greenlander".
Crime and ill intentions towards foreigners are generally virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "hazardous places".
The cold weather may be the only real danger the unprepared will face.
If you go to Greenland during the cold seasons (keep in mind that the farther north you are, the colder it is), it is vital that you wear enough warm clothes.
Many long days in the summer can lead to sleep problems and health problems associated with it.

Traveling to Disneyland is a great worship for many American families.
The "typical" visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus trip to Disney's Hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney's property and returning home.
There may be endless variations, but that's what most people mean when they talk about going to Disney World.
Many of the tickets sold on the network via auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist have been partially used for multi-day parking tickets.
Although this is a very common practice, Disney forbids it: tickets cannot be transferred.
A permit is required from the province for each campsite under the edge of Grand Canyon.
For protection of the canyon the licences are limited and will be available at the 1st number of months, four months in advance.
Such a permit for a restricted area shall be granted on 1 January for each starting date in May.
Places for the most popular sites, such as the Bright Angels campsite close to the Phantom ranch, are usually exhausted after the first day after the opening of the reservations.
There are a number of permits reserved for incoming applications that are granted on the principle of ‘first arrived, first served’.
Entering South Africa by car is an amazing way to learn about the beauty of the entire region, as well as to reach places that are away from the familiar tourist routes.

Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, which is quite close to the border with Livingstone, Zambia and nearby Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers many opportunities for a longer stay both for tourists and adventurers.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water will be higher and waterfalls will be much more impressive.
You'll certainly get wet if you cross the bridge or take the trails that curve around the waterfall.
On the other hand, precisely because the volume of water is so high, your view of the actual Falls will be darkened by all this water!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the site of the discovery in 1922 by Howard Carter of the almost intact royal burial of the young king.
Compared to most royal tombs, however, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, since it is much smaller and less decorated.
Anyone who wants to see evidence of the damage to the mummy during the attempts to get it out of the coffin will be disappointed, as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fairy tales from the tomb were transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited stay best spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Rip. This temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasowarman.

Along with lively and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants, Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must meet certain requirements and be legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador.
These requirements have been set up to provide an organised migration flow between the two countries.
Citizens of Cuba who have a green card from the United States should visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain exemption from this requirement.
You must have a passport valid for at least 6 months after the date of the trip. In order to prove the duration of your stay you need a two-way ticket.
The tours are more convenient for larger groups, so if you travel alone or with only one friend, try to meet other people and gather a group of four to six people for a better price.
However, this should not be really out of your concern, because tourists often move around to fill cars.
In fact, it seems more like a way to lie to people to think they should pay more.
This steep mountain, often used as a background to many pictures of the ruins, hangs above the northern edge of Machu Picchu.
Most reasonably good people should make it for about 45 minutes, although it looks a little scary from below and is steep and difficult to climb.
The stone steps are located along most of the road, and the steeper sections are equipped with secured rails of steel cables.
That said, expect to be breathless, and be careful in steeper places, especially when it is wet, as it can quickly become dangerous.
There's a small cave near the top that needs to be passed through.
The objects and wild nature of the Galapagos Islands can best be seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships with a capacity of 8 to 100 passengers ploughed the waters of Galapagos.
Most people reserve their place much earlier (since boats are usually full in the midst of the season).
Make sure the agent you're using is a specialist from Galapagos with good knowledge of different ships.
This will ensure that your specific interests and/or limitations are consistent with the ship that suits them most.

Antarctica, which extends around the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Visits for tourist purposes are expensive, require good physical form, can only take place during the summer between November and February and are largely limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
Several thousand employees live here during the summer at about fifty bases, mostly located in these areas; few of them remain in the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desert plateau covered with ice 2 - 3 km thick.
Accidental specialized air raids take place on land, for mountain climbing or for going to a pole on which there is a large base.
The route (or highway) of the South Pole is a road from 1600 km from the McMurdo Station at the Ross Sea to the Pole.

They're not very shabby, so the path goes long around the Trans-Atlantic Mountains until it reaches the plateau.
The most widespread cause of incidents in winter is the slippery roads, sidewalks and mostly the steps.
As a minimum, you need shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are inappropriate.

Some boots have spikes and have additional equipment with sliding rods, which is suitable for most shoes and boots, for currents or the whole walker.
The heels must be low and wide. Sand, chakral or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered along roads or paths for better adhesion.
Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow, and excess volumes are collected in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow is sticky and it will take some action to get down, and taking the snow off can trigger other events.
Sometimes the initial event, which acts as a trigger, is the sun’s warming of snow, sometimes additional snowfalls, sometimes other natural phenomena often caused by man.
Tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure that sucks the surrounding air inside and up.
They cause strong winds (often 100 - 200 miles/hour) that can lift heavy objects into the air and carry them in the direction of the tornado movement.

Applications for real-time text translators – applications that can automatically translate from one language into another whole segments of text.
Some of the programs in this group can even translate texts in foreign languages into characters or other objects from the real world when the user directs the smartphone towards them.
