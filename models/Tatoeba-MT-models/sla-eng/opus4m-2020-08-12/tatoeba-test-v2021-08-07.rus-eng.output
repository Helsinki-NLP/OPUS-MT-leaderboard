White on f3, black on e6, white on foot on g4, black on h4 on the mat! In chess circles it is called a "dumb mat".
White: ships on a1, on foot on b6, king on c8. Black: on foot on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites put the rival in a tsugzwang position, putting the ship on a6, followed by the blacks with only two options: take the ship to a6 or move the elephant to any other field of diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move on foot from b6 to b7 and set the mat. In the second case, the white ship takes the black on foot on a7 with the same result.
