Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that they “look like maps ”
Some members of the congregation are surprised by the suggestion that their name be changed to the MPP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that it is "romancing with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh, Welsh twp means "stupidity/crazy", and pwp means "kaka".
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole "is not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said the works his party is "free of reason" for changing the name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and Muppet (Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Commission of the National Assembly, which is currently drafting a law on the introduction of changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any words to name members of the congregation will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
Wells's government law from 2017 gave the Wells congregation the power to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals indicating strong support for naming the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of Assembly members, the commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus can cause headaches for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was put to an attempt to resolve the decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change in name is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's bell kept quiet as churches in Harlem face problems
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's neither."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socialising in another way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started from.”
The churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the settlement.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and therefore the day will speed up when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built from congregations of whites before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists moved away in the 1930s.
A congregation of blacks who practice their faith nearby takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of sellers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s parish members had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the inexplicable leaders of the church and part of the Episcopal diocese.
The church board - the church's governing body, composed of inexplicable leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will demand the transfer of expenses" to the church board, although the church board was not involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some parish members complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark harms a 13-year-old child diving lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then rowing to the group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then “he realized that he was yelling, ‘ He bit me!
He bit me!”
"Hammel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called for everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the children's hospital Radi in San Diego, seduced as if in critical condition.
You don't know what kind the shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier in the area, but decided that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Powered authorities closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's taking over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of goods houses full of professional helpers.
As part of a significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the area of fashion and household declines, large shelves for beauty will be tested in 11 shops everywhere in the country, and will be presented in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the space of shelves that were once intended for television sets, microwave ovens, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they would for the first time double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its Boutique makeup series, so that most products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Craydon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and buying smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury's, said that stores would look more and more like commodity houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos' stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which according to them increased the sales of groceries and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement over how to split profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125m pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sense of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "fraged" after Holly Willoughby backed out of a 11 million-pound deal
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Dan left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew 11 million pounds with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand for products and household accessories.
The couple's business is linked to the Goop brand of Gwynet Paltrow.
This 37-year-old head of the morning programme told Instagram he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, Dragons Dan's star, withdrawing from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a television gold girl admitted during a press meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghemshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean that she no longer has time to devote to their Truly brand for products and household accessories.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Gwynet Paltrow and it was said it would double Willoughby's fortune to 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught them absolutely off guard.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
There's a warehouse full of products ready for sale in Marlowe's headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s programme host, one of Britain’s most paid stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in pillow and candlestick products, including clothing and household products, and because of the potential for further delay.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and Dan Baldwin's husband have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as leader of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We are not commenting on his business ventures."
A serious conversation “and then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting that some would consider "non-presidential" and because he was so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said in his voice that he was disguised as "a news president".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But negotiations for denuclearisation have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States for North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We very much agree with North Korea," he said.
"We were supposed to be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- completed rocket tests, helped free hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to the conversation with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami, Earthquake in Indonesia Destroy the Island, Bring Hundreds of Lives
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, no basic disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" has a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if they will allow international agencies to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the constant earthquakes affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for nature’s anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning system in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign focused on improving Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool's team leveled up against Chelsea
Daniel Staridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League with a score of 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed Staridge the ball about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before pointing it to the distant article.
The ball was moving high above the hexagon as it was turning toward the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumped Capa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always serve as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Staridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just kicked her."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 halfway after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the "blues" passed fifthly back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost halfway to the ground, and then with a sprint he passed halfway to Liverpool.
They rushed in with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, taking Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard crossed the defense and finished the network of the remote article with a left-footed kick next to Alison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples in the group phase of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into a 7.5-strong earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-foot waves, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overwhelmed by a shooting from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been started since a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who had seen or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Hagen said: “The investigation is in its initial phase, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in a facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and, according to police, they will inform the victim's close people.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back in his apartment, but the police told him no entry was allowed, no exit from the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants were now told that they would spend hours before they could return.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears at the scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the border, and another one was outside.
Numerous police officers were standing in the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 citing 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament has become the latest memory blow in a dispute over "writing history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure would become a target in front of the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclast of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
The beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Tornecroft by Cromwell is evidence of 19th - century thinking and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate performance is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Pig-killer rips up and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name of "Juan", was found dead with a torn artery, covered in blood near a blizzard on the market in Liupanshui in Gitzou Province, South China, Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer vaccinations to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinginging Province of Kingshai, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from a nearby piggyback.
He declared that there was a big boar in the joint with the blood of the snout.
Forensics confirmed the boar weighs 550 pounds tore apart the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn," said a cousin named "Wu", according to a quote in Guayang's evening news.
Security camera footage shows Juan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent another person being attacked, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Juan's family and market officials are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that have attacked humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood may act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
All you have to do is give them enough respect," he said.
Remnants from Hurricane Rosa to bring torrential rain to the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves through the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85-mph winds, a urn of category 1 of the 5.00 east time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving east to the west coast of the United States, as Rose approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to enter the great tropical moisture north into the southwest part of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity with the approaching depression will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches [4 inches] of rain will cause sudden floods, debris flow, and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause rainfall in some places about 2 to 3 inches an hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are caused by rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Especially is it recommended not to walk into the desert when it is possible from tropical rain.
A torrential rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local rain to parts of South California’s coastline.
There may be rains of more than half an inch [half an inch], which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain spreads more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The occasional rain will spread into the "four corners" on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to the Arctic's cooling, but tropical areas remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the high east.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long - term forecast suggests an opportunity of over-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony Thursday of nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christina Blassy Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the bottomless political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted regular turnout programs at the last minute Friday: Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the senate court committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was taking her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that that did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, saw it on Friday.
The company counted average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC ratings.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they were showing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people looking into offices.
To show better, it is an audience of a size similar to the playoff competition in football or the awards of the film academy.
Fox News, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After a moderately Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters shouting at him Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being reproached, all of which was being transmitted live to CNN.
"They're standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on the ground?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks covered all hours later, when the judicial committee was supposed to vote in favour of the Kavanaugh nomination in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and with a few senators after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great importance, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "playing politics" over coastline
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the borrowing costs is "totally absurd".
The Wade Simms shooting: police arrest suspect Dion Simson for the death of a sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diteon Simpson has been arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge's police department said.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB partner of CBS said.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Eastern Baton Rouge pathologist's office issued a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head against the neck.
The Department thanks the state police fugitives unit in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the citizens in the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked police for her "activities in search of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The six-footer grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball team coach at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Simms' death.
"This is what you keep worrying about," the coach said.
Volcano dumps ashes on Mexico City
The ash discharge from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered within 24 hours.
The center was followed by more tattoos and shocks.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City’s populated areas, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists noted an increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors of independence clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarising vote to secession Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fighting also broke out, and police used batons to stop the fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted "No forget, no forgiveness", and on the other hand union protesters shouted "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1st referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, although the turnout was low because of the boycott by people against secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting in the region's polling stations.
Independence groups camped overnight Friday to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia has a chance of gaining independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a vital but close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalonian independence parties struggled to maintain the momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders or in self-elected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the successive declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, filming a protest for police support, said the conflict was backed by politicians from both sides.
"It's all getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before a trial last year, announced he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested After Driving in a House · Global Voices
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years of age, were arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a Londonbury house.
The incident took place in Ballinagard Kresent on Thursday at around 7.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said there was damage to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, it could have been shot with a crossbow to the car.
Menga's hit has won Livingstone 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston has won
The advanced Livingstone stepped on the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's country lost its guest victory in the season championship and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are behind with eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continued unbeatable in the division in six matches, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller’s replacement last month.
Livingstone missed his chance against the cruel guests.
Holt's team was supposed to have a long time before they scored, and their directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made it through, but he dragged the attack around the goal, and then Alan Litgow could only point his efforts away after he slid over Craig Halkett's head over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the stock they set up.
And that's how the crucial goal came to pass.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who only touched him and gave him a goal from the center of the sixteenth.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but they couldn't penetrate the host's defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of the game.
That scheme continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was saving Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the ranger's skill, Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from another set action at Livingstone.
Livingstone's helmsman was constantly passing and was constantly defended, while two penalty requests -- following Halkett's argument for Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for a hand game -- were rejected.
"Felminally" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and score for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to overcome the expectations of this uphill path.
Their style and character of play barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was remarkable, managing a super-organised defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Waral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
Just as they were once good under the guidance of Gerard, they are now lagging behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the hosts – and it was a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They deteriorated because of problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed for Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds also said, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposed protestors reflect the split of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat of others.
A car accident on the way to Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A bicycle driver died in a car accident in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of the streets of Besswood and Evelyn, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and an ambulance came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred months after the death of another cyclist in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been set up and buses redirected and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
Specials from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Cops are treated for minor injuries on the scene.
The prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been instructed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, police for public order and peace were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwestern region, risking sudden floods.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, all the way to south and east Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or depression in the 200 - mile - long range of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Arizona's work.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rockies and the Great Basin will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Tracking Authority, almost 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane level Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with the cold waters in the Pacific and decreases.
Therefore, rains in Mexico are expected with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant flood risk.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to Northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," the weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and south Utah by late evening hours Tuesday.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains are the very abundant rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and floods of ruins, as well as landslides in mountain regions.
Midsamer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder since a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsamer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had cell phone records from the case, to step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the most harsh and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassy Ford’s allegations that he had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the turnout of Republicans in the early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not running, but I am really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, with total casualties increasing
At least 384 people died, many were driven by huge waves hitting the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of 6m (18 feet) hit the coast at sunset, taking many to a safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5-pound earthquake, it hit the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people still carried out their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB agency for mediation in Indonesia's disaster briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was pulling cars, trees, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was travelling through the open sea at 800km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos of air released by the disaster agency depicted many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy released from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow shore, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "volume" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the crack of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be increased along the 300km coast (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people there," the Red Cross said in an announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami that it had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared by social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard shouting in a frenzy, warning people down the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water is stuck on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to co-ordinate rescue activities.
The army began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they passed through the desert stage on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's too bad.
Even as relief teams began their dark attempts to start disaster relief efforts, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to come if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulija Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but it still has no status."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the disappeared still hoped that their loved ones would be the wonders that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the crack for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state paraglideration team, trained two of the missing paragliderists for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliderism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how, when he began circulating news about the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paragladerists, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of stamping, rather than with a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 in cash at the Newport of the Cayette.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an employee at Brink's Friday morning who was adding an ATM to Newport's cabin, according to a press release at Newport Police Station.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "ran from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses observed more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information on their identities should contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: rapper changes his name to Y.
Rapper Kane West changed his name to Yea.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Creature formerly known as Kanje West".
Forty - one - year - old West wore her nickname for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande at a show that had to cancel for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'her' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with Radioman Big Boy.
"Which means I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
He left Kanye, meaning the only, to her alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of the numerous known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Grandfather, Pi Didi, or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former associate of the West, Jay Zee, also uses his name with or without a dash and all the capital letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico's VD President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
The army fired at peaceful demonstrators in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funds in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the US does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in the innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top-ranking US body player, and later was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Branch in China.
Lee thanked the previous US government technology competitions as the challenge in robotics of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when the next match would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that took the academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that "green cards" should be automatically offered to doctors of artificial intelligence sciences," he said.
China's National Council issued its Plan for the Development of a Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions similarly to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and Other Governmental Organisations spend money on researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an AI committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation requesting the creation of a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign questioned whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question of the referendum card said: "You have given up membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to enable entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there are no reports of irregularities until 1300 hours.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Cavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The poll, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Thelma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
To succeed the referendum, the turnout should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it came to power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes the entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defense in victory 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Etyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between three Brighton defense players before entering the open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greens.
Rounding up a defense player before running a few others to the edge of Brighton's hex.
He then passed left of him, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to bring back Agüero's ball, which with his right leg beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you scored at that point."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before taking Sterling to the distant article.
The attack on the "heavenly blues" brought the ball into the net before it got out.
The city will fight Hoffenheim in a team of the League of Champions at 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rhine-Neckar arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play spoiler against Rokis
Since Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs fight, there was no reason to force another launch.
But always the competitive Schercer hopes to stand in the central square Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rokis team, which run a competition in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The crew of Rokis had at least a "joker" for a place with a 5 - 2 victory over Nationals on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we'll be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still needs to announce a starter for a week, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Shertzer to throw in such a situation.
Shercer, who will start 34th time, trained throwing on Thursday and will throw the usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Mittinzi for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court as he discussed the importance of the Republicans' exit in the early elections.
"All we have done so far will be put to the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I am not running, but I am really fighting, so I am everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, you see the wickedness, the insolence.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, rude and untruthful."
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the Orders of Democrats, appointed by the Senate Judicial Committee, on behalf of which the audience reacted with calls of disapproval.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, what?
No, no, wait a minute -- that was a very bad body language -- the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Labs no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last member of the parliament of the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome -- just because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow Parliamentarian Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has taken a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham's Eastern Labour Party stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the Labour Party, the council's meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "mild, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if ever, ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly evident that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never otherwise have taken, whether it was national security or the EU's internal security.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical harassment of social media calling for condemnation, denial of central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this kind of experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have great awe at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuse every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "no confidence" or change of selection rules, the party is becoming more narrow-minded.
I have received many suggestions over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be well. ”
But that's not the reason I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the lab party as a student, provoked by the concern of Thatcher's government that literally let my classroom collapse, I fought to improve public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local adviser or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to the Bregzit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste the time and energy of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how damning threats or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeatable Air Tops
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining competition on the day of the Scottish Football Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it is all due to their superior defense, as well as their improved opportunities, which the home team carried, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Praise for Ear, they took better advantage of their chances than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Air a head start, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the Voryors game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot picked up an unconverted point.
Klimo extended Air’s lead with a pen earlier, right in half time, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17 - 5 for Air in the rescue.
But Melrose had a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by the Baggott, had reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and from the beginning, Air continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDoval, converted by Klimo.
Air's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for an extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team also recovered when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock down Klimo without the ball, McPherson produced a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of the sharp attack on Air.
Climate was converting, as you did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Roe took the blow of David Armstrong and sent the wingman Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
Style Game star looks ready for new career in restaurant industry
The Steel Game star, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move to the catering industry after it was discovered to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, where he is a screenwriter and plays together with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
Duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last and it seems that Kirnan plans for life after Cregleng.
According to the official records, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan is trying to join Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a covert Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to return."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost in Chile’s bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is longing for the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may now be the greatest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and calm, and of course a positive outcome is expected," said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court's decision on large screens around the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favour of Bolivia's indictment, which, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Here is Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of native origin, who faces a controversial battle for next year's re-election, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said solemnly at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to judge in favour of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chile's territory and has indicated it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The judgment of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the past four years, they may have reversed Bolivia’s cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian envoy to The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of rebooting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is a "fiction" to believe that the prolonged sanctions and US objections to the declared end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pyeongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats en route to the largest shops nearby
If you want to improve the size of your hat collection or completely block the sun, then don't look any further.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of freaky big hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the fashion set on fashion week in Paris.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations into the eyes of the runway.
The piece highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a broad pin in the shape of feathers that overrun the model's head.
The other too large supplements included watermelons with circuses, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment full of glasses and a diving pipe, and the other looked like melted corn ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style tracks predict that huge hats can come to shops near you.
Too large hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the straw hat with a stitch wide two feet from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spreads through social media sent another great creation on the track, a straw beach bag almost equal to the height of the model it dragged.
The dark orange Rafia bag, with a board of shelves and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques on Fashion Week in Paris.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told Faceae: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer, because the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories. ”
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Independent schools in Scotland hold academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results of the exams, which only strengthens with individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as an election subject in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him arrogant.
If you talk to him in his language, it'll hit him in the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent test results, we can see that languages surpass all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students achieved a higher rating of "5+".
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher rating of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young ones will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an election subject, are seen at the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the programmes of independent schools as well as elsewhere.
The Commission's Commission on Employment and Skills survey in 2014 noted that the reasons employers have caused job failures accounted for 17 per cent of the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly necessary in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a life - style.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polygonal advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, that is 15 percent of the people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important in OK when they are looked at in the future by 2020, as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages he can choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, there can be no denying, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the country's future, so this must be painted in schools.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be considered “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it has to be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will take the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for the fans who wanted to see LeBron James run for Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced James will play in the first preseason game Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play, it's still not decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted James is likely to play for a limited amount of time.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule ahead of Lakers season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
A YouTube channel for a Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of rallies as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five scheduled Trump rallies next week, including visits to favored places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections amidst the mandate, because Republicans may lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia on the internet with live feeds on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of a man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with the anticipated postponement of the Senate vote until one week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
The primary objective of the series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum in the November elections .
Hence, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies next week are aimed at "incentivising volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of the congress is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible with the start of the difficult campaign season," said Trump's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," according to Western Virginia Metro news.
Saturday is the second visit to the Western Virginia Trump in the last month, a country in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisei, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not good for Maurice that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hinder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Coop Ryder 2018: U.S. team shows courage in fighting to keep the hopes alive at the start of individual matches Sunday
After three one - sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoons may have been just what Cup Ryder needed.
The perverseness of happiness is a completely imaginary sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such games.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we have little luck I guess," Jordan Spit said after today's competition.
Europeans, of course, have a four-point lead and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel they have a weak wind in their sails even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points of four.
Spit was great, and he's leading by example.
Those strong cheers of celebration grew stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to a leveling four or four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His shot at the 15th game was met with a similar cry, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to get deep and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that's left for every player right now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, the undeniable story of Cup Ryder.
The strange but beautiful duo of Europe is four out of four and cannot be wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only couple without bad punches on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad blows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine Friday morning.
That series and the way it seems that their energy flows to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, other than Flytwood or Molinari.
You prefer both at the same time on different holes.
However, the talks on European fame remain unjustified.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he hooked up with Alex Noreen.
A missed blow and two of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to look closely at the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they do not listen to and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant leadership on the last day, but the season of four also showed that the US team can fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led 10-6 on the last day of Cup Ryder
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of Cup Ryder after Saturday's lead in double pairs and fours of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Flytwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far on Le Golf Nacional at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who fought to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team that had many failures in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furik’s team needs eight points of 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After "crushing" Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and beat worn-out Woods and US rookie Bryson Deschambo with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henryk Stanson's partner in the fours with the defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in double pairs and came back later to defeat the Pulter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost to the original two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cup Ryder, a certain team has recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as title holders, Furik's team has had enough equal results to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the week’s counterattack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extended sanctions deepened mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing plants and committing itself against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such conditions there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament "in stages", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not refuse unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean war since 1950-53, but the United States has claimed that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to give in to strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even oppose "the declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel us down is a futile dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, Ri's tone was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles to the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocketer" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying "It takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue fully and without exception until complete, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pjonyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it went bad.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours due to "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to disarm the missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalizing relations with Washington
Harvard students attend courses to get enough vacations
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the leading university in the world often know nothing about basic self - care.
Charles Chaiseler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, is designing a course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the lecture a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, never told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basis for how good sleeping habits help in academic and athletic results and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student home where students press on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how inadequate sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student city.
He hopes the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaiseler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm about when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal is toppled by Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Stephen Gerard's fat team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Aybrox's team wanted to register its first victory after the 4-1 February triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team put the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as the manager who left his team eight points behind the runaway lead team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time, and Rangers' setup lost its inspiration and its chances of levelling.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingstone has climbed to third place, and it's only behind the Hibernian, according to the difference in head.
There may be additional problems facing the Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for head injury after he was apparently affected by an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the crew he passed Air in the Cup of Bethfred semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 at Livingstone who scored with Harts last week and would have been happy in the way his well-trained posture choked the opponents at any chance.
Rangers may have dominated the property over the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start when Menga's first game got Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then a blow from Kihan Jacobs' distance reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lolles collided, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two shots at the goal in the first half, but the former goalie of the Aybrox Liam Kelly didn't struggle with the hit with Lasana Kulibali's head and the weak blow of Ovi Edaria.
Although Livingstone's beginning of 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
The Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' strike again.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wingman passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his line with the blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgo and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead at the end of the game, but McGregor got up and stopped Jacobs from playing head-to-head on the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty request after he crashed into Jacobs, but Thomson didn't approve again.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor · Global Voices
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DEFEND ... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then it has become the main stronghold of science, the Geiger counter has become the main stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bell of Colorado", which features these seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that again?
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms that emit radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to “watch ” stray cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch ” the stray cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
You can “see ” protein honor in many types of cancer and then be returned to your body
The vaccine provides promising results in multiple cancer patients.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them into the laboratory, so that they can "watch" the protein honor in many cancers called HER2 and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Institute for Cancer of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanje West made a pro-tramp drop, wearing a drop with his motto, after a performance Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was recorded in the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called the City of Spirits, with a cap bearing the inscription to make America Slavna Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and repeating his support for Trump.
"Frequently when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
Saturday evening's live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Legal Committee, related to charges of sexual assault by Christine Blacy Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's outburst was posted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time getting behind the stage because of his eyelids.
"Behind the stage, I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sinking place, he said, according to Washington Ezeminer.
West went on to say, "You want to see the sinking place?" he said, "he's going to put his Superman cap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted dissatisfaction from the audience at least twice, and the team at the evening show seemed embarrassed, Varajeti reported, a man told the publisher: “The whole studio has failed. ”
The news was brought as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song “I Love It, ” dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPSAD group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for your support of the crowd. ”
But the host of Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was himself and it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for which I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kane West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, also known as Puff Grandfather, Puff, and P Didi.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dog, has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, has changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist of the former Prince.
Charge of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Baliakmor, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the high court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The star of the Trons series, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic manhood.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in a violent, medieval, fantastic series of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement about the Sunday Times cultural section, Keith said he believed that "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #Now I say.
Keith, who recently married the throne star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" on the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we sin with masculinity?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do you learn from TV and what on the street that makes young boys feel that they have to have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuation of the Thrones Game when the show ends next summer, saying he "completed with battles and horses".
From November Keith will perform in the reconstruction of Sam Shepard's true West, a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Thrones game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love affair with Keith's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won Emmy's awards.
The two were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people suffering from HIV is thus reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Junan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is high.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data submitted by a member of staff associated with a senator of the Republican Party as "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters rejected allegations Saturday that a member of her staff had released personal information to three republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's legislators' pages.
The L.A. Democrat assured the claims were "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
"Leagues, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
Information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill as the Senate panel lasted for hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated Supreme Court judge.
The information provided appeared shortly after Cavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication is linked to Waters' office and information about Waters' staff member has been published, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
It can't be challenged.
He must not ask about the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the Democrats associated with Judge Kavanaugh, who was indicted by critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also tweeted.
"If true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed "the competent institutions and police of false claims.
"We will allow the offenders to be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
Thinking of Johnny English Attacks Again - undermines Rowan Atkinson's espionage fraud
Now it's traditional to look for Braggsit in every new British-related movie, and that seems to apply to this re-establishment of the cheating, action comedy Johnny English -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Will the careful self - mocking of the subject of how obviously we are in the middle of nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Nevertheless, the person with large eyes and many faces of incompetent Johnny English received a license to "burn" things for the second time — his name first of all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinemas in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour a little bit like Clouseau, has cartoons of Mr. Bin and part of the boy who plays a note from the Cochii song at the fire of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barklis' now forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor fins hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor looks weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor looks like it's meant for children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy accidents aren't as inventive and focused as the silent stunts of the Atkinson character.
The subject that's been going on the whole time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the disappointment of an agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
At the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combat figure and is already suffering from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this quasi-theresa-May character, but there is nothing special about the scenario that would be dealt with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives secret agents lessons: there are a few good guys here when English offers a school for spying that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Beau, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comical role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all things in the Royal Secret Service, they're back in action and they're meeting the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova, the character of Olga Kirilenko's game.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a waste after they smuggle themselves into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English begins a real anarchy when they try to use a helmet for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of Walt's house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there's a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice temperate stuff.
And like other Johnny English movies, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Labour deny that they're planning for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week -- but they will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company chiefs to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they'd take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "matches" with the party's economic agenda and plans to favour the country's workers.
The shift to a four-day working week is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking party member told Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during a campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, aspirations have not been accepted by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he is determined to seize the power of "directors without a face" and "professors" in the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deductions" because of unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of the boards of companies and to create inclusive property funds, with 10 per cent of private company capital belonging to employees who will be able to take a annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy's making a statement on "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh could change his mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the issue of whether the findings of the bureau could change the minds of some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I think it's clear," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a dented stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blacy Ford.
"Everyone she named couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen festival, and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the great grassland in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants have to perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert the right way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to indicate commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and indications resulting from their activities, 10 billion of which have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children take advantage of their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with insufficient food in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a social injustice of malnutrition, a record in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food told the crowds at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities were taken in connection with calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding of the project, the Power of Food, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions at their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fail.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists to perform this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Li Fourness and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy for a "block" in order to prevent Russian energy exports - the interior ministry
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki discovered, as Washington Ezeminer quoted.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a front for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea roads remain open and, if necessary, to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed the event organised by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while Russia was referred to as "an awkward pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" North Tech 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "convict" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin argues Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
America's stance met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "consider carefully" whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether I should run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting at the city hall and said he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open to her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as Supreme Court Judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that many voters in its electoral unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of "probable" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two per cent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names from the democratic party discussed for the 2020 nomination are former Vice-President Joe Biden and senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is talking about Trak Palin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally.
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence Monday night
"What my son is going through after he returns, I know how other families feel about the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "are returning slightly different, they come back solidified, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what they and their Air Force comrades, and every other member of the military gave it to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and accused of domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennet, a police spokesman in Vasila.
18 federal states, Washington city support new asylum policy dispute
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents asylum from victims fleeing home or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington City filed a petition with the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington to support a asylum-seeking policy challenger, Ann-Bi-Si News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against federal politics, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" had abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum claims in the United States are coming, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls the 2014 Immigration Complaints Board decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City's public defender, Carl Rasin, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of passing laws at the federal, federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering are harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public prosecutor Jeff Sachs ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Seshns said in presenting the policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma as she comforted her male baby at the evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their irrigated objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who had fractures on his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Tears came into his eyes when he described the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blams China for "mutilation" with "advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China's paid addition to the De Moin Register -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US elections for the November 6th Congress, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to push China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade promotions, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war in which they level the import tariffs with each other.
China's avenging tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a former, long-standing Iowa governor, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of De Moin Register, "is now doubling the harassment of propaganda ads in our free press".
"In the destruction of propaganda, the Chinese government has abused the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by posting advertisements in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not really see the desperate opinions the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's firm hand," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his bid to publish" the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans distance themselves from women's votes ahead of mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are silent about or defend Brett Cavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
Of these things there is no going back," said Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that the pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake's FBI (Republican from Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the moving group MoveOn, told Washington D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs commission, decided to continue the Cavanaugh nomination despite Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's testimony, said Mick.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's true.
But they may be taller, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although not liked by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to news from En-Bi-Si.
"It is not only about the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it is about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps choose the Democrats, about the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, though more accept the first-memory side.
A new Ju-Gov poll shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Cavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in the testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another one, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate's legal committee, under oath, last week that Cavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez charges that the Supreme Court judge showed her genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The inventor of the World Network plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Network, starts with a startup business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that was built on an open-source platform called the Solids on Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li was joking that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "data store on the Internet" or short-circuited PO.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluc, Slack and Spotify to be all available to one browser at a time.
What's unique about the personal data store on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a certain kind of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
Inrapt's idea, according to executive director John Bruce, is to provide the company with resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project agreement and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available at Inrapt's web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media release published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Technology Institute's Network in Massachusetts.
In recent times, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesman in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist about the new era of the internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A prominent vector of the Victorian Cross since World War I
The only priest of the Anglican Church who received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorable Bernard Van received a confession on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belengliz and Lehaukur.
Yet, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had received the highest British military medal.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandkids at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quntin "From a very dense fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the places where he shot and with “the greatest courage ” led forward, before attacking the cannon nest himself and incapacitated three of the attendants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us modest".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
The fans of the combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Belator 206, not having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The list from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that was displayed live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., only Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, and viewers in Britain were appalled when the channel switched to Pepa Prases.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the fight.
One of Twitter’s fans described the transfer of children’s cartoons as “a sick joke. ”
"The law was such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to be transferred to a children's program," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of Belator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pig of Pigs", yes"
Company President Belator Scott Cooker said they would be working on a schedule that would include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about playing again, I think we can probably find a solution," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when we were transferring, and none of them were favored.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more for the fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Disks on a desert island: Tom Daley feels "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "they're not all like me"
Speaking on the first broadcast of Discos on the desert island of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
A regular presenter at Kirsty Young's long-term show took months off because of a disease.
Appearing as a parallel character in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferior value and diversity were things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The Olympics with two bronze medals became a famous LGBT campaign supporter and used their performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and want to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "surprise me".
Daley married the Oscarian, who was 20 years old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his looks" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son named his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept dying and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him "you won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- jumping in front of a local audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of a song — Pride from Heather Small — which was spinning in his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he was still narrating.
Disks on an empty island on BBC Radio 4 is Sunday at 11:15 British summertime.
Mikkelson, the horse is out of shape, was on the bench during Cup Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record Sunday when he plays the 47th Cup Ryder game, but he'll have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mikkelson, who played the biennial event, record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the five-time winner, he shares the time to cheer and practice his game, the range, with the hope of correcting the pressure.
He was never the best leader, not even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf Nasional playground, where distant rough blows are a regular punishment for neglect.
And if the terrain itself is not scary enough, Mikelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who plays paired with rookie Tommy Flytwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who miss four points before 12 individual matches, start having a hard time, the game of Mikkelson can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see otherwise.
"He fully understands the role he had today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrities and he's given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it did, and we thought we had to do it.
He likes to play, like everyone else."
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played games at Cup Ryder on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Cup Ryder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furik said his presence carries something immaterial on the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, resourceful, he wants to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership before individual matches on the last day of Cup Ryder can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Danes debuted in Valderama in 1997, when a guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a lead of five points in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the finish line only with the noses", with the lowest lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had great leadership in Walderama; we had great leadership in Brooklyn, when we also lost in Walderama, when we won for a while," Bjorn, a figure, said after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 at Le Golf Nasional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You go ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This is not over as long as the match is ongoing.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy and focus on it.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn added satisfied with the results of his golf players: “I don’t want to give early grades on the issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Individual games await us tomorrow, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then you test all abilities as a golfer.
That's the message to send to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they did in pairs, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the changes on the last day, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We're setting up the line accordingly, and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McClroy's most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to do this with the boys because I think we will cover everything," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete warships since the Cold War, but this will not happen at least until next year due to the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Reinland-Falz, the leading ship of the new class of frigates Baden-Wittenberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the DiCate newspaper, calling for an army spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wittenberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the obsolete frigates from the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trails.
Among other important features is the rarest maintenance - it should be possible, the newest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from the domestic ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships - which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans - will be obsolete by the time they enter the service, DiCate notes.
Fregate with unfortunate fate F125 reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Few are known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Wittenberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
Reinland-Falz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including training the crew -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) -- an increase from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the newest frigates are particularly important due to warnings of the reduced naval force of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem has worsened over time, because old ships have been withdrawn from service but are not provided for replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wittenberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new survey is being carried out on property in the Scottish mountains to find out how bats use the area in the search for food.
It is hoped that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future protection activities.
A study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow ordinary and soprano bats, as well as brown bats with long ears and duabenton bats in Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameramen will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
En-Anch-Es personnel and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the sounds from all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the bat species.
Then a map of habitats will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant in En-Ti-Es, hopes to discover what areas of life are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
Such information will help determine the benefits of management of habitats, such as meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development affecting beds and the loss of housing.
Winds and lights are also a risk, as are duct tape for flies and some chemical treatments for construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares about more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Triv estate in Damfris and Galoway, home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the property is the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He stresses that it is important to check whether there are bats before renovations are made because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official at the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape charges "false news", adding that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American named Catherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to keep from talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking live on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner told his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for accusations they called "unacceptable transfer of private life suspicions," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player would seek damages due to "moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the charges occurred in June 2009 at a hotel and a casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark district court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" of a "good boy", but he gave in under that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and images of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge, and was concerned "that she would be publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old says he now demands a renegotiation of the deal because he has trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and moved to Italian giant Juventus this summer with a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: Britain "always mourns" Car Manufacturers Lose · Global Voices
Britain will "always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Braggzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota-Britnia had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at a plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japan's car manufacturer said the impact of the border stagnation in the case of Bregzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston -- produced by Toyota Auris and Avencis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain takes off from the EU at the end of March there will be a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain have expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, will function when leaving the EU without an agreement.
Be-Em-We, for example, says he's going to close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Braggsit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of Braggsit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "right on time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a border break that industry believes could cause delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory in the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We should have an agreement. We should have the best agreement that will enable us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 programme today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would have been stopped, but in the long run it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Covaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a representative of the factory’s union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have put together a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight on Brett Cavanaugh's nomination for a judge at the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the ties between Trump and Russia's assistants and potential violations of laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thereby jeopardize Miller's independence, has sparked rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the announcement of reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash of the Senate's Justice Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into charges against Kavanaugh, which will further delay the Senate's vote.
The press secretary of Trump Sara Sanders appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been established, could be held this week, and could also be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things go and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not been briefed on White House journalists since September 10th.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said a small number of briefings are not due to the reluctance to "great influence" on TV journalists, although he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without stating any evidence: "We have considered those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you're witnessing that we've been doing it all the time over the past few weeks, and talking to the President of the United States is going to replace the briefings for the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Secretary of Health by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system in connection with Bregsit-related fears
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and desire to stay after Braggsit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal continued during the summer in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of no agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciated the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby undergoes emergency surgery after having suffered head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive player of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered head injury to the competition on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to "Vanderbilt Commodores", said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He has come to the sideline of the playground and is just numbing himself to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put it in a stretcher and took it to a further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had stepped out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/degree of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abekrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red jersey in Tennessee State after the transfer from Illinois.
He did a total of five rallies on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 demolitions this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
Higher administrative fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to secure an affordable home and to focus on high-income people.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to strengthen the government's efforts to improve the situation with the homeless.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee, includes higher levels introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three per cent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120m pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London have been purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which has led to an increase in prices and has caused difficulties for those buying property for the first time in this process of buying housing.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of offering high property prices to keep the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change access home quotas in order to remedy the "disgusting situation of home" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive reforms in the home, including housing controls and ending evictions for no valid reason.
He also wants to give advice on how to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to the return of the British dream, that is, to making life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning its own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of the homeless is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" is in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently ranks third in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after returning "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told Scottish Sportssound at BBC.
"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be obtained if I am successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Pojet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic chief says he felt no anxiety knowing he should follow such established names in such a large club after earlier refusing offers from "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"My success is currently assessed by "can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I return the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which he entered his career after working as assistant to the chief at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the third league dropout and returned "St. Mirren" from the edge of losing the title in the next season.
Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than playing "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls at the takeover of "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough of it, and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in the sense of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life."
You can hear the entire interview on "Sportsound" on Sunday, September 30th on "Radio Scotland" between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British summer time)
According to one survey, the perfect time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services in determining these figures said: “Suntime and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants dropped significantly.
The decline in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June worsened even during July.
The pubs and bars where most drinks are sold have seen a much greater increase compared to previous years than the restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs where food is mostly sold were also hit badly by the sun periods, though not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for vacation and hospitality from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw in late April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to be in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly striking in addition to the ongoing pressures on costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the food-sale sites and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide much needed rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the stagnation in the publication of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales tracking device in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of the same 47 operational groups with a combined income of over 9 billion pounds and is a established rapper for industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that he hides from his parents
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, had a secret social media profile that kept him from his parents and teachers.
The survey involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News raises fear that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" profile to show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, is creating a social media profile that he hides from adults.
The survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a short cut to the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being published on such profiles.
Twenty per cent of the students said they have a refined "main" profile that they show their parents, and they also have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile came across a teenager who asked others to "rape him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admitted that one of them was secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elide Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was elected the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beatty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her wide international experience acquired over the past decade.
"All in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities have great respect for Elid and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a board member," Bitty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help guide sports in Scotland."
An American who won 200m and 400m titles at the Atlanta Games in 1996, in addition to winning a total of four gold medals at the Olympic Games, which is now appearing regularly as a BBC commentator, could not walk after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me whether I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was painful, but I was able to recover fully, and I can go back and do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows has caused division of opinions on the Internet
A breast pump company has caused a division of opinions on the Internet when it publishes an advertisement comparing mothers who suckle cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be the "most powerful breast pump in the world", the user-oriented technology company Elvie published a ridiculous advertisement inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who breastfeed.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay in a song that sounds like this: "Yes, I milk milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed this isn't washed, these are my breasts."
Continues the chorus: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts. ”
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights "the horrors" of the milk industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except for the fact that their children steal from them only a few days after they give birth," one of the comments said.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly integrated into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/ Mother)
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Really inappropriate advertising."
Others defended advertising, and one woman admitted that the song was truly “funny. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I would have bought a pump like this if I was still breast - fed.
It made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It is a genius product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial designed for mothers who milk milk (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
This is not an advertisement that is missing or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, there are no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breastplate, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave home while milking.
Ana Ballarin, partner and DDR in Mother commented: "Elvie's pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk milk and milk cows, we wanted milk milk milk milk to be milked with a pump and the challenges it brings to the center of attention, while displaying the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been present in all the headlines.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakoubovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children in custody has increased significantly, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that acute rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unregistered immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to sponsor a child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors without an escort.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons do not have a prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally staying in the country and most of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to deal with children more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard has been set.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, says shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size there is a greater probability of ignoring signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare emotionally or say good-bye to their friends can increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria Tells US, French, Turkish "occupymental forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muelem has urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately without making conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the country's territory destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a tampon zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a new constitution for Syria and open the way to the elections.
Mualem established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "considering members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump will win the elections again in 2020 unless with impeachment and scandal his presidential mandate is suspended prematurely, which is likely to be hoped for by a large part of the liberalists.
In what will no doubt be “the most dramatic finale in the presidency ever seen! ”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the credit rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05m in CNN and almost tripled and reached 1.6m in MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News has 2.4 million viewers on average at the time of impact, which is 1.7 million more than four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers on evenings when important news is being announced.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the ABC "Designed Survival" drama, as the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skovel, a veteran in writing comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking in the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he is really funny," Mrs. Skovel said.
There's also some fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roy versus Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Disengagement from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you're no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been looking at a panel of experts that's been debating the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a skin bomber from a $15,000 Paul Manafort ostrich (a suit of thick arrogance," as called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking anatomy descriptions by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"A part of what he does and what gives you the feeling of watching a reality show is that every night he brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's rotating team and day-to-day twists.
You can't afford to miss an episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in and watching "MSNBC" while filming on CNN.
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization." Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Inflow of external funds in the narrowest mid-term elections in the Upper House race
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganisation of congressional areas from which there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is being nominated by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who received a seat in another area of last spring's emergency elections.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th congressional area, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps have been amended since the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January to decide that the old areas are being manipulated in favour of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congress area is a tough competition to finance campaigns among party chief sponsors, the Democratic Party's (DCCC) Campaigns Committee and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party ("NRCC").
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the extraordinary election for the 18th congressional area in Pennsylvania held in March, characterised by wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, the place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area in contrast to 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then gave up
The diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under low pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, State Department spokesman in a statement he made earlier this month.
But only in relation to El Salvador were penalties, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the high unemployment and murder rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials had stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any reflection on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pens should address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is the release of a report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is very solid evidence in public records right now.
Mr. Miller is also allegedly directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the congressional composition changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to re-appear to the voters, and possibly to a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainties here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, or his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in the hot chair after the newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unsightly about the function he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we proceed if Brett Kavanaugh's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for the Congress to blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe it will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath at a swastika logo table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of "Rangers" with an optimistic attitude in front of the "Rapid Vienna" conflict.
"Rangers" host a clash with "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, and are aware of the fact that after an unsolvable match against "Villarreal" in Spain early this month, the victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, middle-class player for knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a springboard for bigger achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Willarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
Perhaps we could have given a little more in the end, but the unsolvable result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
We have another big European night ahead of us on Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they've had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll get back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened, that is, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by "Nationwide" said that they had talked to their marriage mates about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your election to finance long-term care may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or provide yourself with a self-insurance policy with your own resources, if you have them.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take the health care authority out so that you can empower a person with confidence to supervise your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the authority of your finances.
In this way, you would choose a person with confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you were unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he is taking and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be ready.

A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from an exit.
The victim was about 40 years old in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "an act of chance".
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid workers cannot get information from the Dongala district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated.
The following are a few key facts for Palu and Dongala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300km (180 miles) on the coast of the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
The Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also, the tsunami struck and west Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southernmost part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit an area near the town of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentaway, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10m and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake hit Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing devastation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of getting out if he pays $500, KTOU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "certainly innocent" when asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to up to a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B violation, I sentenced him to a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time there's been criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case before Alaska's veteran court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report on a crime of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after saying her son's violent behaviour stems from PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck an area near Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media is circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the Palu beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death sentence for Cifulo Saipov, a terrorist attack suspect in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck on Home Depot in October to launch an attack on the West Side Motorway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves in his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intention to claim a death sentence delivered to the South District of New York.
According to court documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death penalty on both grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury filed charges against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detail planning and intent," prosecutors said, while Saipov described it as "grossful, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, harm, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lare Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Ferci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the country's intention report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York was prosecuted for capital punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he asked to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent on all 22 grounds.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty, rather than admit guilty and pass a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved in it," Patton said.
Saipov's defence has previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Party MP Tori says Nigel Faraj should be in charge of negotiations on Bregzit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" during a protest at the Tori party's conference today.
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" from the Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's deputies proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
conservative supporter Peter Bon said at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would "be out of the EU" if Mr Faraz was the secretary for Braggsit.
But the challenge facing Ms. May in bringing together her deeply divided members was stressed by counter-Bragzit members of the Tori party who joined in a special protest against the city's Bregzit.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chekers plan despite attacks by pro-Bregzit individuals, counter-Bregzit individuals and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "the chaos".
Mr. Bon said at the pro-Breggsit meeting "Leave Means Leave" in Solihal that he wants to "refuse the plan from the Chekers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I will support Braggsit, but we must reject the plan from Chekers."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars for now to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the suggestions that public opinion changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain in the EU is completely inaccurate."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori Party and pro-Bregzit party, was also present on the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the Chuckers plan and start listening to us."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added, "Prime ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said at the assembly that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand Braggsit over, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has enabled us to win the Bregzit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-governance and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bragzit faces marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's assembly, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners bearing the title "Toryevci v. Braghzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked conservatives about security issues faced at the opening of the conference on the application created by the party.
"These are the people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Braggsit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe said the Democratic Party of Massachusetts representative spoke about her future during the city's assembly in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's re-election against the Republican Party's national representative Jeff Dil, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump took office as president, whose maintenance uses the city's assembly format.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top."
Arrested suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Simms from the LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms from the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
A police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Ditéon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wad Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result of her death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, said "247sports".
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing weapons, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the police department of Parochial East Baton Rouge.
As a 192 - centimeter - tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 matches with 10 performances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 points per game.
Gran Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders secured him the victory over Sebastian Bethel
From the moment Waltery Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the half-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on a roll as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Bethel to attack his teammate.
Bethel entered the boxing first and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing round later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one of the drivers of Ferrari reluctantly leaving the interior of his free risk of staying aside after a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the network and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led in most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and beat Kimi Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44th round of boxing, but couldn't raise the pace in the other eight circles, so Raikon came to fourth.
It's a tough day today because Walter did a great job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has made a really exceptional decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestein at Saturday's rally over her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blassy Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate had shown that people were "vicious and rude and dishonest".
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and ruthless and dishonest," he said.
"When you see announcements and leaks of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finestein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Finestein regarding allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Finestein denied that leaking information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Finestein told the committee, says The Hill.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same rally Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad speech of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You can see their malice, their malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to regain their power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in the Dundee match
"Dundee Stars" compensated for losing the match in the Elite League framework Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
"Giants" got the advantage of two goals achieved by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney made a head start on the host before Dwyer regained the Giants leadership.
Francois Bushar leveled the Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season within the elite league for Adam Keefe's boys, who won the Dundee 2-1 victory in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with "Giants" winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, or 3:35 a.m. with the addition of Kendall McFol, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Sullivan secured the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Cooney in achieving the score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure "Giants" took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned with a powerful game and goal, with a score of 2737.
Couni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in half of the final period of the fifth match.
"Giants", who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday on the home ground in Milton Kanes.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia has been famous as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong successive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled to save their own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufry airport in Palu, which was constantly swinging.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was at the time on the runway, would fly safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even be accessed," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "The ambulance carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets were robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a man disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that fell into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man disappeared after earlier saying that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they cannot find the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Jane said that he and the others managed to cross through the water that reached half of them and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy also reported that sailors working near the port’s reconstruction also helped to rescue with the help of an inflatable ship, transporting people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the air safety network show that 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have included Air Niugini.
Analyst sets a time frame on the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended by presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He stressed to the jury that he was using phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlet said he got location data from several cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers the night she died, which is contrary to his previous statements, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Telis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted his messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to defeat the negative attitude about this genre by including positive messages in his music.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has drifted away from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lovekey".
Another black girl?!
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being dismissed on the basis of discrimination after having received a message from a mother complaining of the fact that she was “another black woman. ”
The couple deny that they are racist, saying that the lawsuit is in fact “extortion. ”
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris found out that she was black.
"NOEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "uncomfortable" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing a bad job and expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, she announced "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the couple and seeks compensation for a $350-a-day discharge in a six-month period, an engagement that will include her living with the family, what she was initially engaged to do, but without concluding an agreement.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told the Post Friday, adding "I know it is discrimination."
The couple returned the charges that they were racist, saying Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you entrust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Plasco said that his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in “a very difficult situation. ”
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the couple of social media, criticizing them for their conduct and logic.
Publishers of Paddington fear that readers will not be able to connect to a talking bear, the new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington's huge success.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before receiving inspiration to write a book from a little bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For "Padington", whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride over his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But since you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success does not owe you yourself.
I think Paddington's success was taking it that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruitage of his imagination, he always credited the credits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
On her landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital “Louis Pasteur 2 ” in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"I have been contacted regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," Mrs. Edin-Laperuz said.
"Then nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly decreased and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
All I had to do was sit around and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I could not scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm."
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and tears did not stop.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieved Women Place Cards on Bridges to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
"They all remembered him by his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis is making cards "for others to know that there are people out there who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother's death.
"He did not say he felt unhappy or depressed or said anything," she said.
"Several days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He reached the bottom of Christmas day when the children opened their gifts and he did not look them in the eye at all and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death is a great trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to get through it: “It is something like this that destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must go on and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future has been uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, i.e. a limited-time investigation, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is "disintegrating" in conditions of an ingrained partisan state without exit.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican party supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due solely to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to be a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who also worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the undecided result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "decreased" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Yong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Bjeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Department of Unity, said that there were 1,127 crossings at the border last year compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher human trafficking tariffs are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't make a public comment.
The majority of North Korean refugees are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where there is the longest border with North Korea and which can easily be crossed over from the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DPZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stagnation of denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho on Saturday accused the sanctions imposed by the United States of stagnation since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysteric" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that given his temper, he was inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say she was "hysteric," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional about his opening talk, sometimes even shouting and sobbing about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he can't serve in the Supreme Court because it turns out he's biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question as to whether she would try to remove Cavanaugh from office if allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say the following: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only not appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not qualified to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about the possible judgments Kavanaugh will make against the Access Health Care Act or Roe against Wade, as he is considered a subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul any of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "that's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really harsh criticism, months and years of collecting anger that she can't get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued, “I was helped by a woman who was performing an executive role somewhere, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger partly because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my brightest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated me was when I once began to cry with unspeakable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager from whom I always had some fear, caught me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder at that time was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she realized there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign had long been launched, it did not have enough funding, so it promised it would not enter the race if it did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 apiece, would only give her $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During a speech in which she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign she was so overcome by emotions, that she was grateful to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger at sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me, you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to the event.
"You'd think Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was stifling, and although the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries could be useful for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning early this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation has increased significantly during this week by introducing new $200 billion (150 billion) tariffs on goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned in kind every time, or recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return the United States equally, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same thing soon.
Getting Washington to step down means accepting his demands, but public bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long run because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that with a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than it was previously established by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a tink tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee returns, foreign minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily lives are provided.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe wins a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the US team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a European field and has not won the 1993 Ryder Cup title in Europe.
Europe regained its primacy after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, directed the ball into the water in a pair-3 on the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has made a point in all circles, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-ranking player of the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter of England, who may have played the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became a European who won the most titles of the 25.5-point tournament during his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been really hard this year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to help," the emotional Garcia said after winning Europe.
He is now stepping down the seat of his compatriot John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2:1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four games in France, and now he's got a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 great titles, ranking himself after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to the low grass terrains, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his team's disappointing game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point in the morning, we gave the team more difficulties from Europe.
We fought.
Cap'n down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to confess to them.
They beat us.
